J28sXDIjX7k,459,7590,"[smooth music]  - Here's to another episode of ""Uninterrupted: The Shop,"""
J28sXDIjX7k,7633,12262,full of memorable and very unpredictable moments.  Cheers. - Cheers to that.
J28sXDIjX7k,15849,21730,"- What you get in New York, I call a Tony Soprano Italian.  - Yeah.  - If you take a real Italian person to a New York Italian place,"
J28sXDIjX7k,21772,28570,"they're gonna look at you like, ""What the fuck?""  - The truth is, those are Dominicans cooking that food.  [laughter]"
J28sXDIjX7k,28612,34535,I know 'cause they're my cousins.  [laughter]  - Yes. Yeah.
J28sXDIjX7k,34576,41542,"[Drake's ""God's Plan""]  - [singing] They wishin', they wishin'  They wishin', they wishin', they wishin' on me"
J28sXDIjX7k,41583,47672,"I don't wanna die for them to miss me  Yes, I see the things that they wishin' on me"
J28sXDIjX7k,47714,54178,Hope I got some brothers that outlive me  They gon' tell the story... was different with me
J28sXDIjX7k,54221,60184,"God's plan, God's plan  I can't do this on my own, ayy"
J28sXDIjX7k,60227,66358,"No, ayy  I've been me since Scarlett Road, ayy  God's plan, God's plan"
J28sXDIjX7k,68652,74992,"- Remember we said, ""You play basketball.  ""you play–you know, you play baseball."
J28sXDIjX7k,75033,81290,"You don't 'play' fighting."" - No.  [laughter] - You don't play fighting.  - If you play football and you're the quarterback,"
J28sXDIjX7k,81331,87129,"if you make a mistake, it's an interception.  You fight, a mistake is you're knocked the fuck out."
J28sXDIjX7k,87171,93301,"Like– - And the problem with fighting  is, like, when you made a mistake, you have to stick with it for months."
J28sXDIjX7k,93343,100225,"- Yes. - You know?  Yes, because basketball, you play bad today,  next day there's a game. Two day after, there's a game."
J28sXDIjX7k,100267,107565,"And then you go there, you have the opportunity to perform well.  But you, you perform bad, first of all, you have, like, a concussion,"
J28sXDIjX7k,107608,113113,"so you have 90 day out before you even go back to the gym.  - Yes. - So it's, like, six months..."
J28sXDIjX7k,113155,120078,"- You gotta live with it. - You are living with your demon  every day hunting you in your room. - Yeah.  - Like–[growls]  ""You should have done this instead of this."""
J28sXDIjX7k,120120,125501,"[laughter] I'm like, ""Damn.""  - That's also true in comedy. - For months.  - I write on ""Late Night with Seth Meyers,"""
J28sXDIjX7k,125542,133884,"which is, like, a nightly talk show,  and Seth would say, ""If you get jokes on the show, then you feel good,"
J28sXDIjX7k,133926,139389,"""and then the next day you feel great,  ""but if you go a week without getting jokes on the show,  ""you feel bad."
J28sXDIjX7k,139431,147397,"But then the next day, you have a opportunity to have jokes.""  - Yeah. - ""So you feel good.""  And he was saying when he was on SNL,"
J28sXDIjX7k,147439,152861,you would have to wait for a full week to see.  And he would say it was torture.
J28sXDIjX7k,152903,158784,"I was like, ""Oh, wow, I don't have that 'cause every day we have a new show.""  - Yeah. - ""And it's a new opportunity  to do a good job."""
J28sXDIjX7k,158825,164498,- You auditioned for SNL and didn't make it.  What was that like?  I can't imagine how competitive it is auditioning for it.
J28sXDIjX7k,164540,171713,"- Yeah, I mean, we had showcases here in LA,  and I did exactly what they asked,"
J28sXDIjX7k,171755,177010,"but a lot of people just did what they felt,  and I was like, ""Oh, okay, so this is gonna be good for me."""
J28sXDIjX7k,177052,183475,"So then I made it to go to New York for their audition,  and I really thought I was gonna get it."
J28sXDIjX7k,183517,192818,"I don't know why I thought that. So cocky.  So unreasonably cocky.  And I go to do my audition, you know, in the studio,"
J28sXDIjX7k,192860,200284,"you know, on the stage where people give the monologue.  And as I'm walking out, fucking Leslie Jones is walking back."
J28sXDIjX7k,200325,206957,"People are falling out, laughing so fucking hard.  - Oh, wow. - She's not on stage anymore,"
J28sXDIjX7k,206999,213797,"and people are like–[laughs]  The roar. It was like a roar.  And I walk in and I audition, and that was like..."
J28sXDIjX7k,213839,219636,"""Okay."" [laughs]  - You literally followed Leslie Jones in the audition?  - Yeah, I did. - Wow.  - I followed her to nothing."
J28sXDIjX7k,219678,224641,[laughter]  I was the only one of the finalists who did not get hired.
J28sXDIjX7k,224683,231940,"Sasheer, LaKendra, and Leslie–  Leslie and LaKendra were writers.  They got hired all at once, and I did not get hired."
J28sXDIjX7k,231982,237653,"But then a couple days later, I got a call from Seth Meyers  and it was like, he coming to New York anyway to write on my show."
J28sXDIjX7k,237696,243535,"And thank God, because SNL– I do not know them.  I do not know what it is like to write there."
J28sXDIjX7k,243577,251877,"I assume it is much harder than...  - It's brutal. - Fuckin' ""Late Night.""  Seth is just–you and your little friends goofing around all day."
J28sXDIjX7k,251919,259176,"We'll leave, go eat a steak,  come back, write two jokes, and we're done.  Like, it's, you know, Montessori school for comedy."
J28sXDIjX7k,259217,267601,"But, yeah.  I do think, ultimately,  this was what I needed to become a good writer."
J28sXDIjX7k,267643,272773,"- Jake, let me ask. You have an interesting boxing background  where it's like, you have five pro fights.  - Yes. - Right?"
J28sXDIjX7k,272814,279655,"- When did you realize you could fight?  - Man, you know, as crazy as it sounds,  from the first day I sparred."
J28sXDIjX7k,279696,284701,"You know, the coach who I was training with at the time was like--  like, couldn't believe it."
J28sXDIjX7k,284743,291834,"He was like, ""You've never fought before? That was ama–""  Like, he was blown away.  He, like, stopped and was like, ""What's going on here?"""
J28sXDIjX7k,291875,298298,"And just from that day, like, my coach has always told me, like,  ""Yo, you're a natural. This is crazy. You can really fight. Blah, blah, blah."""
J28sXDIjX7k,298340,305973,"And so I started to get confidence in myself because of that.  But then once I put on the 10-ounce gloves in my first pro fight,"
J28sXDIjX7k,306014,311061,"knocked this kid out in the first round, that's when I was like,  ""Oh, wait, maybe my coaches were right."" Like–"
J28sXDIjX7k,311103,317276,"- Up to that point, you weren't even sure. - I wasn't sure.  And they were like, ""You're heavy-handed. You have power. Blah, blah, blah."""
J28sXDIjX7k,317317,323323,"But that was the first moment of me realizing, like,  ""Damn, I could really take this far."""
J28sXDIjX7k,323365,328620,"- Do you think people take you seriously as a boxer and do you give a shit?  - I don't give a shit, you know? But I think–"
J28sXDIjX7k,328662,334042,- I didn't at first. I'll be honest.  I didn't at first. - Me too.  - I did not at first. - Yeah.
J28sXDIjX7k,334084,339214,"- I'll be honest. I was like, ""This is a gimmick.""  I didn't wanna watch this shit.  I didn't take you seriously at first at all."
J28sXDIjX7k,339256,344261,- Has your perspective changed as you've seen him evolve more fights?  - Yeah.
J28sXDIjX7k,344303,349808,"I mean, I think everyone that doubted him at this point"
J28sXDIjX7k,349850,355731,"has agreed that he's a legit one.  I mean, at first I was like, ""Okay, whatever."""
J28sXDIjX7k,355772,361320,"Yeah. You know, ""Even my grandma can box.""  [laughter]"
J28sXDIjX7k,361361,370829,"Then you kind of, like, see him, how he fight.  I think it was a Tyron Woodley fight.  I'm like, ""Okay, if, after this fight, somebody has a doubt about him,"
J28sXDIjX7k,370871,377336,"that means he has a personal problem with it, you know?""  - I feel like you're one of the most judged people..."
J28sXDIjX7k,377377,383800,"- Totally. - In the public eye.  It's like if I asked ten people, ""Give me one word to describe Jake Paul,""  I'd probably get ten different answers. - Yeah."
J28sXDIjX7k,383842,388847,"- Right? I'd get, ""He's a boxer. He's a YouTuber.  He's a troll. He's doing good for sport."""
J28sXDIjX7k,388889,395938,"- ""Cringe.""  [laughter]  - How do you feel about, like, the negativity  that comes along with social and all of that for you personally?"
J28sXDIjX7k,395979,403987,"- When I was younger, the comments definitely affected me,  'cause I wasn't as confident.  I was, like, 15 years old and I would be getting all these comments."
J28sXDIjX7k,404029,409910,"And I was bullied in high school.  When I started, like, making it on Vine,"
J28sXDIjX7k,409952,415791,eventually I became numb to it and now I don't care what people say
J28sXDIjX7k,415832,423924,unless it is a well-crafted thought from someone who is successful  and has walked at least somewhat in my shoes.
J28sXDIjX7k,423966,428970,- It's interesting to hear everyone's perspectives  even though it's different professions.
J28sXDIjX7k,429012,437563,"And the key element for all of us is confidence.  People have, like, this perception..."
J28sXDIjX7k,437604,445779,"""Okay, he's confident,"" or, ""She's confident.""  The moment they feel that energy that you're not confident,"
J28sXDIjX7k,445821,454288,"your shit is ruined.  'Cause if you go and you're about to fight someone,  and your opponent feels like, ""He's a bit scared,"""
J28sXDIjX7k,454329,461795,"you'll get your ass beat.  - You know, speaking of confidence, you had–[clears throat]  You were in a group, a super successful group, Aventura."
J28sXDIjX7k,461837,467968,"Did you ever doubt yourself, like, ""Hey, can I do this thing on my own?""  - Had you asked me maybe 20 years ago,"
J28sXDIjX7k,468010,474183,"""Could you deliver a show in the way I do today?""  I would have told you, ""There's no way."""
J28sXDIjX7k,474224,479646,"In fact, I remember that I would perform, and once a song was over,"
J28sXDIjX7k,479688,485027,I couldn't speak to the crowd 'cause I was so shy that–  - Wow. - Oh.
J28sXDIjX7k,485068,492451,"- Oh, it was terrible.  It took a lot of years of practice.  And for me,"
J28sXDIjX7k,492492,497497,"people not knowing my songs, you know, at an early stage,  I had to talk to them."
J28sXDIjX7k,497539,504588,"I had to. - You had to bring them along with you.  - I just–I was making motherfuckers laugh.  So if you ever go to one of my shows, there's a lot of comedy."
J28sXDIjX7k,504630,510093,"- And so you just saw comedy as, like, ""Oh, this is a way for me to relax  and to help the crowd relax."""
J28sXDIjX7k,510135,516433,It was more for the crowd or was it more for you?  - I would say it was a combination.  It started more with my confidence.
J28sXDIjX7k,516474,521979,"Like, if these people perceive that I'm nervous..."
J28sXDIjX7k,522021,527736,"I'm ruined.  So I would just make fun of people.  Like, I'm about to sing this song and I would just say something like,"
J28sXDIjX7k,527778,533992,"""Yo, is that your girl? But why's she looking at me?""  [laughter]  - I'd be like, ""Honey, we gotta go."""
J28sXDIjX7k,534034,539873,"[laughter]  ""Yo, we're going home."" - ""Get your shit.  We gotta get the fuck out of here, right?"""
J28sXDIjX7k,539915,545379,"- And to be honest with you, at times, that didn't go well for me.  But again, we go back to the confidence. - Like what? What happened?"
J28sXDIjX7k,545420,553262,"- Ooh, I was doing a show– I'ma say, like, maybe eight years ago.  I'll improvise singing to the chick,"
J28sXDIjX7k,553303,558976,"and I would tell the dude, ""Your girl, she loves me.  You know, we have a history."""
J28sXDIjX7k,559017,565691,"[laughter] - Oh, shit.  - Mind you, I don't know her.  Listen, this dude, he's, like, grilling me, like–"
J28sXDIjX7k,565732,572489,"[laughter] Like, ""I'm about to fuck you up, bro.""  I thought he was just playing along  and he was making my show more interesting."
J28sXDIjX7k,572531,577744,I realize he wasn't acting when he threw his glass on stage.
J28sXDIjX7k,577786,583207,"[laughter] - Shit.  - Yeah, I think everybody realized that, ""Oh, he's serious.""  - True story. Yeah."
J28sXDIjX7k,583250,590257,"And I was like, ""Whoa.""  They escorted him out the building, and I felt,  ""Aw, man, like, I provoked this shit."" You know?"
J28sXDIjX7k,590299,595429,"- Did his girl stay? - Oh, yeah, she did.  - Oh, no. [laughter]  - Oh. - Oh!"
J28sXDIjX7k,595470,601685,"- Well, that's not his girl, then. - That's not his girl.  - Exactly. That's not his girl anymore. - That's not his girl.  - Question. With all the success you guys have had,"
J28sXDIjX7k,601727,610319,"do you still get nervous? - I do.  - I feel like once 300 people have booed you,"
J28sXDIjX7k,610360,619369,"it's hard to feel nervous.  I used to work at a theater called Boom Chicago in Amsterdam.  And we would have a lot of, like, stag dudes and bachelorette parties"
J28sXDIjX7k,619411,625667,"and people would come just fucked up. - Drunk?  - And then from–you'd be like, ""Hey, welcome to Boom Chicago."""
J28sXDIjX7k,625709,632132,"They'd be like, ""Ahh, eat shit!"" And you'd be like, ""God damn.""  And you would know you're gonna have a bad show  and you know you gotta fight 'em a little bit and get–"
J28sXDIjX7k,632174,637679,"- And you just go through it. That must be hard.  - But then they've destroyed it already.  I mean, it is hard, but it's also great,"
J28sXDIjX7k,637721,643852,"'cause once you do that, you can do anything.  - To be honest with you, like, every time I walk on stage,"
J28sXDIjX7k,643894,650108,"I feel–I don't know if the right term is ""nervousness.""  It's just, like, this... - Stress."
J28sXDIjX7k,650150,655905,"- Anxiety. - Anxious.  - The butterfly anxious. Yeah. - Yeah.  And I think that I describe that as still respecting the craft,"
J28sXDIjX7k,655948,660911,"still respecting, you know, the crowd.  - Champ, you still get nervous on the walk-out?"
J28sXDIjX7k,660953,667125,"- Of course. [clears throat]  I mean, we don't play. We don't perform.  We fight, you know?"
J28sXDIjX7k,667167,673298,"And you're going to fight somebody.  You don't know what will happen in that octagon, you know?"
J28sXDIjX7k,673340,679388,"And also, the responsibility that you have,  the reason why you are fighting for–"
J28sXDIjX7k,679429,686061,there's thousands of things that can happen in there and you don't know.  - Sure. - You just have to find out
J28sXDIjX7k,686103,691608,"in the next 25–15 or 25 minutes.  - Have you ever got in the ring and realized,"
J28sXDIjX7k,691650,699949,"""The guy across from me is scared""? - Yeah.  - Oh. - Now I can see that.  Before the fight, everybody's is like, talk and this, you know."
J28sXDIjX7k,699992,707124,"But when they lock that cage, like... [makes clunk noise]  [laughter]  You look at your opponent in your– in your opponent eyes like this,"
J28sXDIjX7k,707165,714047,"and at that moment, I'm like, you see somebody who are like,  ""Damn, what did I do?"" - [laughs]  - Like, ""Ooh."" I'm like, ""Bro, it's over. It's time."""
J28sXDIjX7k,714089,719386,"- I can't believe people get in there and they're like, ""I'm confident.""  - They do. - That's insane.  - They lock that cage, I'm like, ""Excuse me?"""
J28sXDIjX7k,719428,724516,"- People get in the cage with you and they go, ""I'm fine.""  - ""Excuse me? Excuse me? Could somebody open that door?"""
J28sXDIjX7k,724558,729646,"[laughter]  If I looked across and saw him, I'd be like...  - Yeah, no shot. - It'd be like, ""No."""
J28sXDIjX7k,729688,735194,"- Jake, you're five fights in. Do you still–  I assume you still get nervous on the walk-out.  - I'm more so just excited because,"
J28sXDIjX7k,735235,742367,"honestly, I put in all the work and done all the preparation, right?  And we spar all the time in training camp."
J28sXDIjX7k,742409,748123,"You know, hundreds of rounds, and I'm not getting paid for that.  So this is the night I get to go out there and get paid"
J28sXDIjX7k,748165,753962,"and, like, do my thing and actually– we can get out of there early.  We don't have to go the whole entire fight."
J28sXDIjX7k,754004,761553,"We can have a early night, put 'em to sleep, and get out of there.  - You bring up pay.  It would have been very easy for you"
J28sXDIjX7k,761595,766600,"to make your money, get paid, worry about you.  You know, I think since your first, second fight,"
J28sXDIjX7k,766642,772731,"you've taken on, someone from your world, Dana White,  talked about UFC, the gap in pay."
J28sXDIjX7k,772773,778529,"Why has that been such an important cause for you to take up?  - Yeah. For me it's about changing combat sports in general, you know?"
J28sXDIjX7k,778570,785869,"That's what I've always been passionate about doing since I came in  and helping women's boxing and my foundation, Boxing Bullies,"
J28sXDIjX7k,785911,794878,"which helps kids get involved in this sport early.  But then the fighter pay side of it,  I've just seen how people and fighters are getting taken advantage of, you know?"
J28sXDIjX7k,794920,800259,"This is the most dangerous sport in the world,  and the UFC, you know, makes billions of dollars a year,"
J28sXDIjX7k,800300,806974,"and they're only paying their fighters 15% of that.  You know, Ari Emanuel, the CEO of Endeavor,"
J28sXDIjX7k,807015,812855,"you know, his salary last year was more than the entire UFC roster."
J28sXDIjX7k,812896,818652,"So these fighters are risking their lives for $10,000 dollars.  There's no long-term healthcare."
J28sXDIjX7k,818694,826118,"So for me, I just saw it as a problem,  and I am one of the people who can use my platform to speak up about it"
J28sXDIjX7k,826159,833083,because a lot of fighters in the UFC are scared to say something  'cause Dana can just shelf them.
J28sXDIjX7k,833125,839339,"So I'm one of the very few people who doesn't need Dana necessarily.  And, yeah."
J28sXDIjX7k,839381,844887,"I started talking about it and it just got a ton of momentum and I was like,  ""Yeah, like, okay, I'm gonna continue to talk about this."""
J28sXDIjX7k,844928,851143,"And now more and more people are speaking up,  so it sort of started this revolution, and Francis is one of the people.  - Yay. - Yeah, but Francis,"
J28sXDIjX7k,851185,857482,what gives you the courage to stand up?  Why do you have the–  'cause you've stood up against him and you're talking about it now.
J28sXDIjX7k,857524,864198,"- I think money was more– at first, it was pride.  I was frustrated of how they were treating me, you know."
J28sXDIjX7k,864239,870954,"First because I didn't want to sign a contract,  and that I feel like they were using that power against me."
J28sXDIjX7k,870996,876919,This contract is fucked up. I don't have it.  I don't wanna sign my life to somebody
J28sXDIjX7k,876960,882049,who doesn't give me something else in return.  He doesn't have any responsibility.
J28sXDIjX7k,882090,888388,"He can decide whenever he want and cut you,  and he's not even obligated to give you fights."
J28sXDIjX7k,888430,895521,So what is the reason of signing this type of contract?  - But this is the difference.  Francis is one of the most exciting fighters in the world.
J28sXDIjX7k,895562,901777,"He has the strongest punch in the world, I believe.  And he's the heavyweight champion of the world in MMA."
J28sXDIjX7k,901818,906990,"In boxing, the heavyweight champion of the world makes 32 million.  - A fight. - But he–"
J28sXDIjX7k,907032,912204,"this is public information, he's making 600, 700K in a fight.  So that's where the discrepancy is."
J28sXDIjX7k,912246,919211,"- That's a big discrepancy. - And no one can see that?  That is fucked up.  - I'm not a genius, but that's a big discrepancy.  - That's fucked up. - But it's very simple."
J28sXDIjX7k,919253,924216,"In boxing, they have to negotiate. It's open.  There is two side. - It's open.  It's not one company."
J28sXDIjX7k,924258,930722,"- Here, there is one company who owns both fighter,  you and your opponent.  - It's a conflict of interest. I don't even know if that's legal."
J28sXDIjX7k,930764,936395,"- So it's just you guys. ""Okay, you guys are fighting.  You're fighting that guy."" - That's the thing. Is that legal?  - It's the same. - Is that legal?"
J28sXDIjX7k,936436,942192,"- So no more power.  But the problem is, like, the company is so big,"
J28sXDIjX7k,942234,950826,and they are getting bigger and fighters are getting smaller.  Then everybody is scared.  Nobody wanna face or to fight the company or to say no.
J28sXDIjX7k,950868,958083,"That's no good. - But if all the fighters came together...  - They cannot come together.  It's very complicated because financially,"
J28sXDIjX7k,958125,964464,"if somebody have to rely on you to pay his bill  because you're controlling his wallet, how much he get,"
J28sXDIjX7k,964506,969845,"and you can do whatever you want, of course he cannot stand up against you."
J28sXDIjX7k,969887,977144,"- The fighters can band together, though, and that–  - No, they cannot.  - But we–I say ""we""– we can, because eventually,"
J28sXDIjX7k,977186,983692,"my ultimate goal is to create a fighter's union.  It needs to be done.  And it seems impossible, and maybe it will be,"
J28sXDIjX7k,983734,990865,"but that's how, and people will say,  ""Jake, like, how are you gonna create a fighter's union?  Like, you know, they'll just shelf all the fighters in the fighter's union."""
J28sXDIjX7k,990908,997372,"No, everyone comes together and we're not fighting.  We're not fighting.  - So–so–so– - That's how they do it here."
J28sXDIjX7k,997414,1003212,"There's writer's guilds. There's director's guilds.  - How you gonna feed those people?  Because a lot of them, after eight months–"
J28sXDIjX7k,1003253,1010552,"after eight weeks of training camp,  after four months of not fighting, they are poor, bro."
J28sXDIjX7k,1010594,1018185,"- What he's saying is, to create a union, what you actually have to be okay with is,  ""I'm taking a stand for not me, but for the future fighters."
J28sXDIjX7k,1018227,1024233,"Let's do this now for the future of fighting.""  Which, I do agree with that. - We'll make more in the long run."
J28sXDIjX7k,1024274,1030697,"- Well, you–my point is, you may not even do it,  but the fighters coming behind you will benefit.  - Exactly. The next generation. - You have to be okay with that."
J28sXDIjX7k,1030739,1036995,- Exactly.  - I'm not the biggest fan of America.  This is one of the things we do great is a union.
J28sXDIjX7k,1037037,1042292,We will negotiate on some fools. Every–  [laughter]
J28sXDIjX7k,1042334,1047756,- I love how she says it though. - Every union has gone through this.  Every single union.
J28sXDIjX7k,1047798,1055889,"I think you are a million percent correct. It is 1,000% possible.  And yeah, like, people will be poor for a minute, and that's part of it."
J28sXDIjX7k,1055931,1063897,"It's part of it.  It's–you know, the only– - Here's the thing. Time out. All right?  I'll call upon the ten biggest boxers– ten highest-paid boxers"
J28sXDIjX7k,1063939,1069987,"and ten highest-paid people from the UFC.  Yo, why can't you donate $200,000 to the union"
J28sXDIjX7k,1070028,1076952,"to help pay these fighters for these six months?  Are you that selfish?  Floyd Mayweather, Canelo, who makes 50 million for a fight."
J28sXDIjX7k,1076994,1081998,"Canelo, you can't donate $200,000 to this union?  I'll donate 500,000. I'll donate a million."
J28sXDIjX7k,1082040,1087504,- To pay them whether or not they– - I'll throw in a million  so that we can pay– - You're in for a million?  - I'm in for a million.
J28sXDIjX7k,1087546,1093635,I'm in for–I could raise more than that.  But I'm saying that– the money that we put into the union
J28sXDIjX7k,1093677,1099516,"can help pay the fighters who aren't getting paid  as much in the interim, and that's how it could be funded."
J28sXDIjX7k,1099558,1105647,"- Well, it's very interesting, though, because, obviously,  people have a lot of different perceptions of you–  fights, partying."
J28sXDIjX7k,1105689,1110819,"You've had, obviously, controversies and things.  But it's interesting to hear you say that, like, as a human, you are growing."
J28sXDIjX7k,1110861,1116950,"How old are you? Just 25, right? - I'm 25.  - Oh. - But no, like–like you said,  it's like my– [both laugh]"
J28sXDIjX7k,1116992,1124541,"- People shouldn't be hitting you. You're a child.  - Nah– [laughter]  Well, I–yeah, I grew up on camera, so anything I did wrong–"
J28sXDIjX7k,1124583,1131381,"like, and by the way, I was doing stuff wrong and–  - As every teenager does.  - Yeah, and fighting has helped me mature and become a different person."
J28sXDIjX7k,1131423,1137971,"But it is, like you said, like, you know, I messed up and did stupid shit  that I'm not proud of. - [laughs]"
J28sXDIjX7k,1138013,1145312,"- I'm 40, I'm still fucked up.  - I'm saying yesterday, dang.  I feel like when I was young, those jokes– man, fuck."
J28sXDIjX7k,1145354,1150776,Thank God nobody was taping that shit.  It was horrible garbage. Horrible garbage.
J28sXDIjX7k,1150817,1159575,"But I feel like, especially in comedy,  you say some rancid, rancid shit because it gets laughs."
J28sXDIjX7k,1159618,1166124,"Any time you say– you know, like when you were a kid  and you went ""poo-poo.""  And everyone would be like, ""Ah, this is the best.  Don't worry. This is hilarious."""
J28sXDIjX7k,1166166,1172840,"And then it's that same element.  And when you get older, then it's the same type of garbage"
J28sXDIjX7k,1172881,1181265,"that gets you cred for being, you know, edgy.  And you don't realize that that's garbage until you're a little bit older."
J28sXDIjX7k,1181306,1186395,"- And by living in, like, the world we're living, obviously–  censorship, cancel culture, all those things–"
J28sXDIjX7k,1186436,1192317,is anything going too far in comedy?  - I feel like what a lot of people are calling cancel culture
J28sXDIjX7k,1192359,1197614,"is just accountability, you know?  And I don't think we can just be"
J28sXDIjX7k,1197656,1204329,"shitting on everybody all the time anymore.  It used to be anything goes, and now it doesn't.  And that's great, 'cause guess what?"
J28sXDIjX7k,1204371,1210627,It used to be cool to not hire me because how I look.  - Of course. - You know?  So I can't be–I can't be mad at that.
J28sXDIjX7k,1210669,1216216,"I think that we as a people are evolving, and it'll take some people a long time."
J28sXDIjX7k,1216258,1222347,Some people are there already.  But it is that journey that we're all in right now.
J28sXDIjX7k,1222389,1228102,"And yeah, it feels bad and weird.  Who cares? Getting better feels bad.  Also, like, people go,"
J28sXDIjX7k,1228145,1235903,"""Oh, I can't be rac– I can't be the one who did the bad thing.""  But if society as a whole is–"
J28sXDIjX7k,1235944,1243869,"I'm so sorry that I've come to this.  - [laughs] We're here. Go for it.  - If society as a whole is built on white supremacy, which it is,"
J28sXDIjX7k,1243911,1249708,then we cannot act like we are all above it.
J28sXDIjX7k,1249750,1256840,We're in it. We're in it.  It's in the very fabric of our lives.  It's how we live. It's on the fucking money.
J28sXDIjX7k,1256882,1263347,"It's everywhere, and I think... - [laughs]  - That's more of the thing.  It's not like, ""You were a bad dude and you did this"
J28sXDIjX7k,1263388,1271146,"and you are bad and it's tarnished on you forever.""  That's not it.  It's like, ""Yeah, I'm a product of society, what do you fucking want?"
J28sXDIjX7k,1271188,1277277,"""So yeah, thank you for giving me the opportunity to get there.  Take me with you.""  - Let me ask you, when you go on every night,"
J28sXDIjX7k,1277319,1283325,"there's never been many women in late night.  Do you feel that pressure of, like,  especially as a Black woman, going on every night?"
J28sXDIjX7k,1283367,1289748,"- I'm a 40-year-old Black lady from Omaha, Nebraska.  I don't feel a need to, like, represent everybody."
J28sXDIjX7k,1289790,1295169,"I can't.  If Black people– if Black women were a monolith,  I absolutely could and I'd love to do it."
J28sXDIjX7k,1295212,1302261,"But we're not, so I can't.  - Just to go back on the cancel culture thing,  it's like, if people wanna have cancel culture and cancel somebody,"
J28sXDIjX7k,1302302,1307850,"cool, you know?  You did something wrong, maybe apologize for it. Whatever.  You offended a bunch of people."
J28sXDIjX7k,1307891,1315148,But then that same society should give that same person  the opportunity to grow and change.
J28sXDIjX7k,1315190,1321613,"""That was wrong. Don't do that again.""  And, you know, give them the opportunity to realize what they did was wrong."
J28sXDIjX7k,1321655,1328370,But that's the problem with cancel culture is it just–it needs to be so definite.  Society likes to place things in boxes.
J28sXDIjX7k,1328412,1335002,"Jake Paul is this, you know? Maverick Carter is this.  Cancel on this.  No, like, that's not how it is."
J28sXDIjX7k,1335043,1341091,- But it's also the jumping on the bandwagon with social media  where a lot of people are just voicing an opinion
J28sXDIjX7k,1341133,1346889,"without having the full facts 'cause they wanna be down.  - Exactly. - You know?  It's like, I release an album"
J28sXDIjX7k,1346930,1352895,"and you see some dudes like, dissecting my music immediately."
J28sXDIjX7k,1352936,1358399,"The shit just came out.  [laughter]  Like, it took me two years to record this album,"
J28sXDIjX7k,1358442,1365574,"and you're immediately like, ""That shit wack.""  I don't expect everyone to love what I do, but I think there's a difference"
J28sXDIjX7k,1365616,1370704,between constructive criticism and straight up just bullying and hating.
J28sXDIjX7k,1370746,1377878,"- Mm-hmm.  - So I think that that has a lot to do with it, too,  that people just–they want that clout."
J28sXDIjX7k,1377920,1385384,"- That cred, yeah. - You know?  Like, these motherfuckers are doing podcasts in their rooms  like they're experts in music."
J28sXDIjX7k,1385427,1393769,"- I receive comments sometime– whether it's a DM or a comment–  and people will break down, tell you how you should train"
J28sXDIjX7k,1393810,1399398,"and how you should fight. - Mm-hmm.  - [laughs] Yes.  - Like, I put a video of me, like, hitting meat,"
J28sXDIjX7k,1399441,1404820,"and the guy will be like, ""No, work more on your wrestling.  ""You have to see this coach.  And it works like this, like that, like that."""
J28sXDIjX7k,1404863,1410744,"I'm like, ""Whoa, hold on a minute. What is your record?""  Like, how– - [laughs]  - This guy never fight in his life."
J28sXDIjX7k,1410786,1418293,"He never been in the gym, you know? - Uh-huh.  - You are working your ass every day, twice a day, or whatever. You know?"
J28sXDIjX7k,1418335,1423924,"- [laughs]  - Yeah, like, ""I can hear he's uninspired.  I can hear, like""– You can't hear shit, you know?"
J28sXDIjX7k,1423966,1430179,"- So, Romeo, by the way, talking about Latin music,  it's always been big, but now you've got like all the new artists–  Bad Bunny, [mumbles]."
J28sXDIjX7k,1430222,1437187,What's the difference what they're going through now and dealing with  versus when you first started?  'Cause you've been around a very long time.
J28sXDIjX7k,1437229,1442442,"- Shit. The bag.  - The bag got bigger, right? - The bag.  I mean, no, but all jokes aside,"
J28sXDIjX7k,1442484,1448490,"you know, I think that especially urban music  is living a momentum that's amazing."
J28sXDIjX7k,1448532,1453954,Like–and the digital just changed absolutely everything in a good way.
J28sXDIjX7k,1455831,1462337,"Guys like Bad Bunny...  Balvin, Ozuna,"
J28sXDIjX7k,1462379,1470345,"you know, they kind of inspired other artists like,  ""Okay, we can become successful,"""
J28sXDIjX7k,1470387,1477060,"and a lot faster than in my generation.  You know, before I even reached stardom,"
J28sXDIjX7k,1477102,1484443,"I was already doing local group– like, local clubs,  shit like that for, like, five years."
J28sXDIjX7k,1484484,1490032,"You know, the industry has changed so drastically that it's like,"
J28sXDIjX7k,1490073,1495829,"""Yo, you could become un fenómeno""...  - Yeah. - [speaking Spanish]"
J28sXDIjX7k,1495871,1502127,"- Off a hit on Soundcloud. - Yeah.  - One song. Yeah. - Like, I'm talking about, like,  these guys have– like, I remember speaking to Ozuna"
J28sXDIjX7k,1502169,1508300,"when he was just starting.  Like, a year and a half later... he was a superstar."
J28sXDIjX7k,1508342,1514680,"- And you've collaborated with a lot of artists.  Like, who was the one that surprised the fuck out of you?  Like, ""Damn, that's some shit I didn't exp–"""
J28sXDIjX7k,1514723,1520729,They went to a level you didn't know they were gonna go to.  - So I produced and wrote a record
J28sXDIjX7k,1520771,1526485,"for my second solo album with Marc Anthony.  It was a salsa,"
J28sXDIjX7k,1526527,1536370,"which is not–no mi fuerte.  You know, I'm a bachatero. I do bachata.  But I'm a huge fan of salsa as well."
J28sXDIjX7k,1536411,1544002,"And for him to trust me in producing and songwriting a salsa  for me was, like, surreal."
J28sXDIjX7k,1544044,1551301,"And I recall being in the studio with Marc  just guiding him, like– by the way, he doesn't need no guidance,"
J28sXDIjX7k,1551343,1559518,"but, you know, I'm like,  ""Yo, could you do it like this? Could you do it like that?""  And I'm so passionate about this shit that I'm a bit intense at moments."
J28sXDIjX7k,1559560,1565691,"And I remember that once we were done with the session,  he was like, ""Bro, I can't remember the last time"
J28sXDIjX7k,1565732,1574658,"""that I was in a studio session this long  and motherfucker's telling me, 'Yo, could you do the slogan like this?'"""
J28sXDIjX7k,1574700,1581247,"And that was, for me, a surreal moment just because I grew up on Marc."
J28sXDIjX7k,1581290,1587671,"Like, I just grew up, like,  wow, this guy, to me, was, like, unreachable."
J28sXDIjX7k,1587713,1594344,"And to be able to write, produce a song with him,  like, that's just crazy to me."
J28sXDIjX7k,1594386,1602019,"That was a very special moment.  - Jake, have you had some boxers reached out to you that you're like,  ""Damn, I can't believe that boxer reached out to me"
J28sXDIjX7k,1602060,1610527,"with some advice or some...""  - Yeah, look, I mean, there's been a ton of support,  which is crazy and I think the biggest one,"
J28sXDIjX7k,1610569,1617075,"who is one of my idols, is Mike Tyson.  He's taken me under his wing in some sorts, you know?"
J28sXDIjX7k,1617117,1623664,"We've partied together. He's given me advice.  Like, he's such a– - [laughs]  - Such a dope, dope guy. - Party with Mike."
J28sXDIjX7k,1623707,1629796,"[laughs]  - Evander Holyfield.  You know, Devin Haney. Ryan Garcia. David Benavidez."
J28sXDIjX7k,1629838,1638722,"-They've taken you in as, like, ""You're one of us""?  - Yeah, I'll be DMing Benavidez like,  ""Yo, like, what would you recommend for this sort of workout?"" Da, da, da."
J28sXDIjX7k,1638764,1643852,"And he'll, like, give me advice and I implement it.  So... - Does that give you self-validation"
J28sXDIjX7k,1643894,1648898,knowing that these guys are the real fucking guys and giants  are welcoming you into their fraternity?
J28sXDIjX7k,1648941,1656156,"- No, yeah, it means a lot and it's dope, you know?  And they've all been so awesome to me and I appreciate that."
J28sXDIjX7k,1656198,1662329,"It means a lot.  And, you know, they're not haters, you know?  'Cause there's a lot of people at first in the boxing world"
J28sXDIjX7k,1662371,1668836,"who were like, ""Oh, I don't know.""  And there's still people who are like, ""Oh, I don't know.  I don't know about this.""  But the fact that they are showing love,"
J28sXDIjX7k,1668877,1676677,"you know, that is all the motivation and proof that I need.  - Think it'll always be like that and we will always have those people."
J28sXDIjX7k,1676718,1682015,"That's what make the community. That's what make your friend base.  You can't pick, like, ""Okay, I just want a good guy."""
J28sXDIjX7k,1682057,1687813,There's always bad-guy haters be in between.  You have to deal with them. You have to learn how to deal with them
J28sXDIjX7k,1687855,1694570,"or ignore them and move on.  And doesn't matter how good you are.  You might become the best person on Earth,"
J28sXDIjX7k,1694611,1702870,"but you will always have criticism.  You're gonna have, like, a hundred people liking you.  You're gonna find someone like, ""Oh, he's this. He's that. Oh, he's""–"
J28sXDIjX7k,1702911,1710294,"and that can't change.  - I cannot believe how true that is.  Like, if a thousand people are like, ""This the shit."""
J28sXDIjX7k,1710335,1715883,"Those ten motherfuckers who are like– - Oh, yeah.  Sometimes it's one. It's enough. - Like, what is that?"
J28sXDIjX7k,1715924,1722681,"- When you see those kind of comment, look at the reply.  You know, you will find your real friend reply and go after."
J28sXDIjX7k,1722723,1729229,- Do you ever reply to them?  - From my fake account.  [laughter]
J28sXDIjX7k,1729271,1735819,"- No, you don't! Delete that account now!  - I ain't gonna win. I ain't gonna win. I ain't gonna win."
J28sXDIjX7k,1735861,1742409,"No, listen, and I have to be honest.  That shit feels good.  [laughter]"
J28sXDIjX7k,1742451,1751293,"He says, ""You suck.""  Shit. [laughter]  Oh, man.  - I don't reply, but most of the time, my fan reply to those."
J28sXDIjX7k,1751335,1757174,You know? And then I will look at it...  - And you like it. It makes you feel good.  - My fan defends me.
J28sXDIjX7k,1757216,1765641,"- Can I just say...  mad props to the optimism, man. - Cheers.  - Every time we say something negative or something like that–"
J28sXDIjX7k,1765682,1771730,"- I was gonna say that. You know, Romeo– - Mad props.  - 7 billion people on the planet, he can kick everybody's ass, right?"
J28sXDIjX7k,1771772,1777110,I have no idea after sitting with him  how the fuck he gets in a rage to go fight somebody.
J28sXDIjX7k,1777152,1783283,- That's a question I had. When you're fighting someone–  I'm so sorry that this might sound very silly–
J28sXDIjX7k,1783325,1789164,"do you feel angry? - You're mad at them.  - Or is it, like, a– - It's a job.  - It's a job. - It's a job."
J28sXDIjX7k,1789206,1795461,"- You can't be angry. You'll get tired. You have to be calm.  - Do they ever make you angry, though?  - You don't have to be angry."
J28sXDIjX7k,1795504,1801510,"Like, me, it's really hard to get me angry.  I just know the reason why. - We know.  - Yeah, we've picked that up."
J28sXDIjX7k,1801552,1808684,"- I just have to remind myself why I'm fighting.  When you come from a small village from a country like Cameroon,"
J28sXDIjX7k,1808725,1816233,"nobody expect you to become a world champion.  From where I came from, we weren't even allowed to have a dream."
J28sXDIjX7k,1816275,1823323,"That's why, like, anytime when I have a chance,  I just go back home.  It's at the moment that I kind of, like, realize–"
J28sXDIjX7k,1823365,1830414,"kind of collect myself, realize, like, where I'm from, you know?  - That's dope. And, you know, like, you just..."
J28sXDIjX7k,1830455,1838881,"I remember this for a second.  Like, I sold out two Yankee Stadiums  and, you know, sometimes it takes a while for you to digest,"
J28sXDIjX7k,1838922,1846096,"you know, like, those moments that they mean a lot to people,  but also, you know, you should enjoy every moment,"
J28sXDIjX7k,1846138,1852143,"every successful moment. - Exactly.  - And my uncle said something to me.  He was like, ""Are you ready?"""
J28sXDIjX7k,1852186,1857691,"Like, he tells me, ""Are you ready to tell your kids, like,"
J28sXDIjX7k,1857733,1864823,"how this felt?""  And I'm like, ""Oh, shit.""  Like, sometimes you get caught up with the production."
J28sXDIjX7k,1864865,1871038,"- Your craft. - And the moment.  - Yeah, and, you know,  and then you're like, ""Oh, shit, like, this is, you know""–"
J28sXDIjX7k,1871079,1876418,"So that's deep. I could relate to that.  - Then you are like, ""Okay, this is the real shit."""
J28sXDIjX7k,1876460,1883258,"You know, I remember, like, when I first won the belt,  I went back home and was living my normal life."
J28sXDIjX7k,1883300,1888680,"And then sometime at night, I'm like,  ""I'm a world champion, right? I have a belt."""
J28sXDIjX7k,1888722,1894227,"So I will go check, like, ""Am I dreaming, or it's true?""  [laughter] Because for me, it was just, like..."
J28sXDIjX7k,1894269,1901026,"- Wow. - Nothing changed.  I'm like, ""Okay, why I'm not feeling a change?  Like, why life is just so normal?"""
J28sXDIjX7k,1901068,1907407,"I just looked at it, I'm like, ""Okay, so if the belt is here,  that means I'm a world champion.""  But you don't realize it. - Yes. You don't realize it."
J28sXDIjX7k,1907449,1915082,"- Of course. - But the champ, by the way,  no matter how much he gets paid fighting,  he can make a lot more as a therapist and a motivational fucking speaker."
J28sXDIjX7k,1915123,1920211,"I think you've got two clients already.  And with that, we're a wrap. Thank you, everyone."
J28sXDIjX7k,1920254,1928387,"- Yay. [applause]  - [singing] I don't wanna die for them to miss me  - Romeo Santos was, like, 20% of my playlist."
J28sXDIjX7k,1928428,1934101,- [laughs] - Hey.  - Enrique Iglesias and Prince Royce.  - You have good taste in music.
J28sXDIjX7k,1934142,1940273,[laughter]  You're invited to my next show.  - We gotta make that happen. - I'ma fuck with you.  just don't fuck me up.
J28sXDIjX7k,1940315,1947698,"[laughter]  - [singing] Sometimes I don't, ayy, don't  I finessed down Weston Road, ayy, 'nessed"
J28sXDIjX7k,1947739,1952828,"Might go down a G.O.D., yeah, wait  I make sure that north-side eat"

J28sXDIjX7k,459,7590,"[smooth music]  - Here's to another episode of ""Uninterrupted: The Shop,"""
J28sXDIjX7k,7633,12262,full of memorable and very unpredictable moments.  Cheers. - Cheers to that.
J28sXDIjX7k,15849,21730,"- What you get in New York, I call a Tony Soprano Italian.  - Yeah.  - If you take a real Italian person to a New York Italian place,"
J28sXDIjX7k,21772,28570,"they're gonna look at you like, ""What the fuck?""  - The truth is, those are Dominicans cooking that food.  [laughter]"
J28sXDIjX7k,28612,34535,I know 'cause they're my cousins.  [laughter]  - Yes. Yeah.
J28sXDIjX7k,34576,41542,"[Drake's ""God's Plan""]  - [singing] They wishin', they wishin'  They wishin', they wishin', they wishin' on me"
J28sXDIjX7k,41583,47672,"I don't wanna die for them to miss me  Yes, I see the things that they wishin' on me"
J28sXDIjX7k,47714,54178,Hope I got some brothers that outlive me  They gon' tell the story... was different with me
J28sXDIjX7k,54221,60184,"God's plan, God's plan  I can't do this on my own, ayy"
J28sXDIjX7k,60227,66358,"No, ayy  I've been me since Scarlett Road, ayy  God's plan, God's plan"
J28sXDIjX7k,68652,74992,"- Remember we said, ""You play basketball.  ""you play–you know, you play baseball."
J28sXDIjX7k,75033,81290,"You don't 'play' fighting."" - No.  [laughter] - You don't play fighting.  - If you play football and you're the quarterback,"
J28sXDIjX7k,81331,87129,"if you make a mistake, it's an interception.  You fight, a mistake is you're knocked the fuck out."
J28sXDIjX7k,87171,93301,"Like– - And the problem with fighting  is, like, when you made a mistake, you have to stick with it for months."
J28sXDIjX7k,93343,100225,"- Yes. - You know?  Yes, because basketball, you play bad today,  next day there's a game. Two day after, there's a game."
J28sXDIjX7k,100267,107565,"And then you go there, you have the opportunity to perform well.  But you, you perform bad, first of all, you have, like, a concussion,"
J28sXDIjX7k,107608,113113,"so you have 90 day out before you even go back to the gym.  - Yes. - So it's, like, six months..."
J28sXDIjX7k,113155,120078,"- You gotta live with it. - You are living with your demon  every day hunting you in your room. - Yeah.  - Like–[growls]  ""You should have done this instead of this."""
J28sXDIjX7k,120120,125501,"[laughter] I'm like, ""Damn.""  - That's also true in comedy. - For months.  - I write on ""Late Night with Seth Meyers,"""
J28sXDIjX7k,125542,133884,"which is, like, a nightly talk show,  and Seth would say, ""If you get jokes on the show, then you feel good,"
J28sXDIjX7k,133926,139389,"""and then the next day you feel great,  ""but if you go a week without getting jokes on the show,  ""you feel bad."
J28sXDIjX7k,139431,147397,"But then the next day, you have a opportunity to have jokes.""  - Yeah. - ""So you feel good.""  And he was saying when he was on SNL,"
J28sXDIjX7k,147439,152861,you would have to wait for a full week to see.  And he would say it was torture.
J28sXDIjX7k,152903,158784,"I was like, ""Oh, wow, I don't have that 'cause every day we have a new show.""  - Yeah. - ""And it's a new opportunity  to do a good job."""
J28sXDIjX7k,158825,164498,- You auditioned for SNL and didn't make it.  What was that like?  I can't imagine how competitive it is auditioning for it.
J28sXDIjX7k,164540,171713,"- Yeah, I mean, we had showcases here in LA,  and I did exactly what they asked,"
J28sXDIjX7k,171755,177010,"but a lot of people just did what they felt,  and I was like, ""Oh, okay, so this is gonna be good for me."""
J28sXDIjX7k,177052,183475,"So then I made it to go to New York for their audition,  and I really thought I was gonna get it."
J28sXDIjX7k,183517,192818,"I don't know why I thought that. So cocky.  So unreasonably cocky.  And I go to do my audition, you know, in the studio,"
J28sXDIjX7k,192860,200284,"you know, on the stage where people give the monologue.  And as I'm walking out, fucking Leslie Jones is walking back."
J28sXDIjX7k,200325,206957,"People are falling out, laughing so fucking hard.  - Oh, wow. - She's not on stage anymore,"
J28sXDIjX7k,206999,213797,"and people are like–[laughs]  The roar. It was like a roar.  And I walk in and I audition, and that was like..."
J28sXDIjX7k,213839,219636,"""Okay."" [laughs]  - You literally followed Leslie Jones in the audition?  - Yeah, I did. - Wow.  - I followed her to nothing."
J28sXDIjX7k,219678,224641,[laughter]  I was the only one of the finalists who did not get hired.
J28sXDIjX7k,224683,231940,"Sasheer, LaKendra, and Leslie–  Leslie and LaKendra were writers.  They got hired all at once, and I did not get hired."
J28sXDIjX7k,231982,237653,"But then a couple days later, I got a call from Seth Meyers  and it was like, he coming to New York anyway to write on my show."
J28sXDIjX7k,237696,243535,"And thank God, because SNL– I do not know them.  I do not know what it is like to write there."
J28sXDIjX7k,243577,251877,"I assume it is much harder than...  - It's brutal. - Fuckin' ""Late Night.""  Seth is just–you and your little friends goofing around all day."
J28sXDIjX7k,251919,259176,"We'll leave, go eat a steak,  come back, write two jokes, and we're done.  Like, it's, you know, Montessori school for comedy."
J28sXDIjX7k,259217,267601,"But, yeah.  I do think, ultimately,  this was what I needed to become a good writer."
J28sXDIjX7k,267643,272773,"- Jake, let me ask. You have an interesting boxing background  where it's like, you have five pro fights.  - Yes. - Right?"
J28sXDIjX7k,272814,279655,"- When did you realize you could fight?  - Man, you know, as crazy as it sounds,  from the first day I sparred."
J28sXDIjX7k,279696,284701,"You know, the coach who I was training with at the time was like--  like, couldn't believe it."
J28sXDIjX7k,284743,291834,"He was like, ""You've never fought before? That was ama–""  Like, he was blown away.  He, like, stopped and was like, ""What's going on here?"""
J28sXDIjX7k,291875,298298,"And just from that day, like, my coach has always told me, like,  ""Yo, you're a natural. This is crazy. You can really fight. Blah, blah, blah."""
J28sXDIjX7k,298340,305973,"And so I started to get confidence in myself because of that.  But then once I put on the 10-ounce gloves in my first pro fight,"
J28sXDIjX7k,306014,311061,"knocked this kid out in the first round, that's when I was like,  ""Oh, wait, maybe my coaches were right."" Like–"
J28sXDIjX7k,311103,317276,"- Up to that point, you weren't even sure. - I wasn't sure.  And they were like, ""You're heavy-handed. You have power. Blah, blah, blah."""
J28sXDIjX7k,317317,323323,"But that was the first moment of me realizing, like,  ""Damn, I could really take this far."""
J28sXDIjX7k,323365,328620,"- Do you think people take you seriously as a boxer and do you give a shit?  - I don't give a shit, you know? But I think–"
J28sXDIjX7k,328662,334042,- I didn't at first. I'll be honest.  I didn't at first. - Me too.  - I did not at first. - Yeah.
J28sXDIjX7k,334084,339214,"- I'll be honest. I was like, ""This is a gimmick.""  I didn't wanna watch this shit.  I didn't take you seriously at first at all."
J28sXDIjX7k,339256,344261,- Has your perspective changed as you've seen him evolve more fights?  - Yeah.
J28sXDIjX7k,344303,349808,"I mean, I think everyone that doubted him at this point"
J28sXDIjX7k,349850,355731,"has agreed that he's a legit one.  I mean, at first I was like, ""Okay, whatever."""
J28sXDIjX7k,355772,361320,"Yeah. You know, ""Even my grandma can box.""  [laughter]"
J28sXDIjX7k,361361,370829,"Then you kind of, like, see him, how he fight.  I think it was a Tyron Woodley fight.  I'm like, ""Okay, if, after this fight, somebody has a doubt about him,"
J28sXDIjX7k,370871,377336,"that means he has a personal problem with it, you know?""  - I feel like you're one of the most judged people..."
J28sXDIjX7k,377377,383800,"- Totally. - In the public eye.  It's like if I asked ten people, ""Give me one word to describe Jake Paul,""  I'd probably get ten different answers. - Yeah."
J28sXDIjX7k,383842,388847,"- Right? I'd get, ""He's a boxer. He's a YouTuber.  He's a troll. He's doing good for sport."""
J28sXDIjX7k,388889,395938,"- ""Cringe.""  [laughter]  - How do you feel about, like, the negativity  that comes along with social and all of that for you personally?"
J28sXDIjX7k,395979,403987,"- When I was younger, the comments definitely affected me,  'cause I wasn't as confident.  I was, like, 15 years old and I would be getting all these comments."
J28sXDIjX7k,404029,409910,"And I was bullied in high school.  When I started, like, making it on Vine,"
J28sXDIjX7k,409952,415791,eventually I became numb to it and now I don't care what people say
J28sXDIjX7k,415832,423924,unless it is a well-crafted thought from someone who is successful  and has walked at least somewhat in my shoes.
J28sXDIjX7k,423966,428970,- It's interesting to hear everyone's perspectives  even though it's different professions.
J28sXDIjX7k,429012,437563,"And the key element for all of us is confidence.  People have, like, this perception..."
J28sXDIjX7k,437604,445779,"""Okay, he's confident,"" or, ""She's confident.""  The moment they feel that energy that you're not confident,"
J28sXDIjX7k,445821,454288,"your shit is ruined.  'Cause if you go and you're about to fight someone,  and your opponent feels like, ""He's a bit scared,"""
J28sXDIjX7k,454329,461795,"you'll get your ass beat.  - You know, speaking of confidence, you had–[clears throat]  You were in a group, a super successful group, Aventura."
J28sXDIjX7k,461837,467968,"Did you ever doubt yourself, like, ""Hey, can I do this thing on my own?""  - Had you asked me maybe 20 years ago,"
J28sXDIjX7k,468010,474183,"""Could you deliver a show in the way I do today?""  I would have told you, ""There's no way."""
J28sXDIjX7k,474224,479646,"In fact, I remember that I would perform, and once a song was over,"
J28sXDIjX7k,479688,485027,I couldn't speak to the crowd 'cause I was so shy that–  - Wow. - Oh.
J28sXDIjX7k,485068,492451,"- Oh, it was terrible.  It took a lot of years of practice.  And for me,"
J28sXDIjX7k,492492,497497,"people not knowing my songs, you know, at an early stage,  I had to talk to them."
J28sXDIjX7k,497539,504588,"I had to. - You had to bring them along with you.  - I just–I was making motherfuckers laugh.  So if you ever go to one of my shows, there's a lot of comedy."
J28sXDIjX7k,504630,510093,"- And so you just saw comedy as, like, ""Oh, this is a way for me to relax  and to help the crowd relax."""
J28sXDIjX7k,510135,516433,It was more for the crowd or was it more for you?  - I would say it was a combination.  It started more with my confidence.
J28sXDIjX7k,516474,521979,"Like, if these people perceive that I'm nervous..."
J28sXDIjX7k,522021,527736,"I'm ruined.  So I would just make fun of people.  Like, I'm about to sing this song and I would just say something like,"
J28sXDIjX7k,527778,533992,"""Yo, is that your girl? But why's she looking at me?""  [laughter]  - I'd be like, ""Honey, we gotta go."""
J28sXDIjX7k,534034,539873,"[laughter]  ""Yo, we're going home."" - ""Get your shit.  We gotta get the fuck out of here, right?"""
J28sXDIjX7k,539915,545379,"- And to be honest with you, at times, that didn't go well for me.  But again, we go back to the confidence. - Like what? What happened?"
J28sXDIjX7k,545420,553262,"- Ooh, I was doing a show– I'ma say, like, maybe eight years ago.  I'll improvise singing to the chick,"
J28sXDIjX7k,553303,558976,"and I would tell the dude, ""Your girl, she loves me.  You know, we have a history."""
J28sXDIjX7k,559017,565691,"[laughter] - Oh, shit.  - Mind you, I don't know her.  Listen, this dude, he's, like, grilling me, like–"
J28sXDIjX7k,565732,572489,"[laughter] Like, ""I'm about to fuck you up, bro.""  I thought he was just playing along  and he was making my show more interesting."
J28sXDIjX7k,572531,577744,I realize he wasn't acting when he threw his glass on stage.
J28sXDIjX7k,577786,583207,"[laughter] - Shit.  - Yeah, I think everybody realized that, ""Oh, he's serious.""  - True story. Yeah."
J28sXDIjX7k,583250,590257,"And I was like, ""Whoa.""  They escorted him out the building, and I felt,  ""Aw, man, like, I provoked this shit."" You know?"
J28sXDIjX7k,590299,595429,"- Did his girl stay? - Oh, yeah, she did.  - Oh, no. [laughter]  - Oh. - Oh!"
J28sXDIjX7k,595470,601685,"- Well, that's not his girl, then. - That's not his girl.  - Exactly. That's not his girl anymore. - That's not his girl.  - Question. With all the success you guys have had,"
J28sXDIjX7k,601727,610319,"do you still get nervous? - I do.  - I feel like once 300 people have booed you,"
J28sXDIjX7k,610360,619369,"it's hard to feel nervous.  I used to work at a theater called Boom Chicago in Amsterdam.  And we would have a lot of, like, stag dudes and bachelorette parties"
J28sXDIjX7k,619411,625667,"and people would come just fucked up. - Drunk?  - And then from–you'd be like, ""Hey, welcome to Boom Chicago."""
J28sXDIjX7k,625709,632132,"They'd be like, ""Ahh, eat shit!"" And you'd be like, ""God damn.""  And you would know you're gonna have a bad show  and you know you gotta fight 'em a little bit and get–"
J28sXDIjX7k,632174,637679,"- And you just go through it. That must be hard.  - But then they've destroyed it already.  I mean, it is hard, but it's also great,"
J28sXDIjX7k,637721,643852,"'cause once you do that, you can do anything.  - To be honest with you, like, every time I walk on stage,"
J28sXDIjX7k,643894,650108,"I feel–I don't know if the right term is ""nervousness.""  It's just, like, this... - Stress."
J28sXDIjX7k,650150,655905,"- Anxiety. - Anxious.  - The butterfly anxious. Yeah. - Yeah.  And I think that I describe that as still respecting the craft,"
J28sXDIjX7k,655948,660911,"still respecting, you know, the crowd.  - Champ, you still get nervous on the walk-out?"
J28sXDIjX7k,660953,667125,"- Of course. [clears throat]  I mean, we don't play. We don't perform.  We fight, you know?"
J28sXDIjX7k,667167,673298,"And you're going to fight somebody.  You don't know what will happen in that octagon, you know?"
J28sXDIjX7k,673340,679388,"And also, the responsibility that you have,  the reason why you are fighting for–"
J28sXDIjX7k,679429,686061,there's thousands of things that can happen in there and you don't know.  - Sure. - You just have to find out
J28sXDIjX7k,686103,691608,"in the next 25–15 or 25 minutes.  - Have you ever got in the ring and realized,"
J28sXDIjX7k,691650,699949,"""The guy across from me is scared""? - Yeah.  - Oh. - Now I can see that.  Before the fight, everybody's is like, talk and this, you know."
J28sXDIjX7k,699992,707124,"But when they lock that cage, like... [makes clunk noise]  [laughter]  You look at your opponent in your– in your opponent eyes like this,"
J28sXDIjX7k,707165,714047,"and at that moment, I'm like, you see somebody who are like,  ""Damn, what did I do?"" - [laughs]  - Like, ""Ooh."" I'm like, ""Bro, it's over. It's time."""
J28sXDIjX7k,714089,719386,"- I can't believe people get in there and they're like, ""I'm confident.""  - They do. - That's insane.  - They lock that cage, I'm like, ""Excuse me?"""
J28sXDIjX7k,719428,724516,"- People get in the cage with you and they go, ""I'm fine.""  - ""Excuse me? Excuse me? Could somebody open that door?"""
J28sXDIjX7k,724558,729646,"[laughter]  If I looked across and saw him, I'd be like...  - Yeah, no shot. - It'd be like, ""No."""
J28sXDIjX7k,729688,735194,"- Jake, you're five fights in. Do you still–  I assume you still get nervous on the walk-out.  - I'm more so just excited because,"
J28sXDIjX7k,735235,742367,"honestly, I put in all the work and done all the preparation, right?  And we spar all the time in training camp."
J28sXDIjX7k,742409,748123,"You know, hundreds of rounds, and I'm not getting paid for that.  So this is the night I get to go out there and get paid"
J28sXDIjX7k,748165,753962,"and, like, do my thing and actually– we can get out of there early.  We don't have to go the whole entire fight."
J28sXDIjX7k,754004,761553,"We can have a early night, put 'em to sleep, and get out of there.  - You bring up pay.  It would have been very easy for you"
J28sXDIjX7k,761595,766600,"to make your money, get paid, worry about you.  You know, I think since your first, second fight,"
J28sXDIjX7k,766642,772731,"you've taken on, someone from your world, Dana White,  talked about UFC, the gap in pay."
J28sXDIjX7k,772773,778529,"Why has that been such an important cause for you to take up?  - Yeah. For me it's about changing combat sports in general, you know?"
J28sXDIjX7k,778570,785869,"That's what I've always been passionate about doing since I came in  and helping women's boxing and my foundation, Boxing Bullies,"
J28sXDIjX7k,785911,794878,"which helps kids get involved in this sport early.  But then the fighter pay side of it,  I've just seen how people and fighters are getting taken advantage of, you know?"
J28sXDIjX7k,794920,800259,"This is the most dangerous sport in the world,  and the UFC, you know, makes billions of dollars a year,"
J28sXDIjX7k,800300,806974,"and they're only paying their fighters 15% of that.  You know, Ari Emanuel, the CEO of Endeavor,"
J28sXDIjX7k,807015,812855,"you know, his salary last year was more than the entire UFC roster."
J28sXDIjX7k,812896,818652,"So these fighters are risking their lives for $10,000 dollars.  There's no long-term healthcare."
J28sXDIjX7k,818694,826118,"So for me, I just saw it as a problem,  and I am one of the people who can use my platform to speak up about it"
J28sXDIjX7k,826159,833083,because a lot of fighters in the UFC are scared to say something  'cause Dana can just shelf them.
J28sXDIjX7k,833125,839339,"So I'm one of the very few people who doesn't need Dana necessarily.  And, yeah."
J28sXDIjX7k,839381,844887,"I started talking about it and it just got a ton of momentum and I was like,  ""Yeah, like, okay, I'm gonna continue to talk about this."""
J28sXDIjX7k,844928,851143,"And now more and more people are speaking up,  so it sort of started this revolution, and Francis is one of the people.  - Yay. - Yeah, but Francis,"
J28sXDIjX7k,851185,857482,what gives you the courage to stand up?  Why do you have the–  'cause you've stood up against him and you're talking about it now.
J28sXDIjX7k,857524,864198,"- I think money was more– at first, it was pride.  I was frustrated of how they were treating me, you know."
J28sXDIjX7k,864239,870954,"First because I didn't want to sign a contract,  and that I feel like they were using that power against me."
J28sXDIjX7k,870996,876919,This contract is fucked up. I don't have it.  I don't wanna sign my life to somebody
J28sXDIjX7k,876960,882049,who doesn't give me something else in return.  He doesn't have any responsibility.
J28sXDIjX7k,882090,888388,"He can decide whenever he want and cut you,  and he's not even obligated to give you fights."
J28sXDIjX7k,888430,895521,So what is the reason of signing this type of contract?  - But this is the difference.  Francis is one of the most exciting fighters in the world.
J28sXDIjX7k,895562,901777,"He has the strongest punch in the world, I believe.  And he's the heavyweight champion of the world in MMA."
J28sXDIjX7k,901818,906990,"In boxing, the heavyweight champion of the world makes 32 million.  - A fight. - But he–"
J28sXDIjX7k,907032,912204,"this is public information, he's making 600, 700K in a fight.  So that's where the discrepancy is."
J28sXDIjX7k,912246,919211,"- That's a big discrepancy. - And no one can see that?  That is fucked up.  - I'm not a genius, but that's a big discrepancy.  - That's fucked up. - But it's very simple."
J28sXDIjX7k,919253,924216,"In boxing, they have to negotiate. It's open.  There is two side. - It's open.  It's not one company."
J28sXDIjX7k,924258,930722,"- Here, there is one company who owns both fighter,  you and your opponent.  - It's a conflict of interest. I don't even know if that's legal."
J28sXDIjX7k,930764,936395,"- So it's just you guys. ""Okay, you guys are fighting.  You're fighting that guy."" - That's the thing. Is that legal?  - It's the same. - Is that legal?"
J28sXDIjX7k,936436,942192,"- So no more power.  But the problem is, like, the company is so big,"
J28sXDIjX7k,942234,950826,and they are getting bigger and fighters are getting smaller.  Then everybody is scared.  Nobody wanna face or to fight the company or to say no.
J28sXDIjX7k,950868,958083,"That's no good. - But if all the fighters came together...  - They cannot come together.  It's very complicated because financially,"
J28sXDIjX7k,958125,964464,"if somebody have to rely on you to pay his bill  because you're controlling his wallet, how much he get,"
J28sXDIjX7k,964506,969845,"and you can do whatever you want, of course he cannot stand up against you."
J28sXDIjX7k,969887,977144,"- The fighters can band together, though, and that–  - No, they cannot.  - But we–I say ""we""– we can, because eventually,"
J28sXDIjX7k,977186,983692,"my ultimate goal is to create a fighter's union.  It needs to be done.  And it seems impossible, and maybe it will be,"
J28sXDIjX7k,983734,990865,"but that's how, and people will say,  ""Jake, like, how are you gonna create a fighter's union?  Like, you know, they'll just shelf all the fighters in the fighter's union."""
J28sXDIjX7k,990908,997372,"No, everyone comes together and we're not fighting.  We're not fighting.  - So–so–so– - That's how they do it here."
J28sXDIjX7k,997414,1003212,"There's writer's guilds. There's director's guilds.  - How you gonna feed those people?  Because a lot of them, after eight months–"
J28sXDIjX7k,1003253,1010552,"after eight weeks of training camp,  after four months of not fighting, they are poor, bro."
J28sXDIjX7k,1010594,1018185,"- What he's saying is, to create a union, what you actually have to be okay with is,  ""I'm taking a stand for not me, but for the future fighters."
J28sXDIjX7k,1018227,1024233,"Let's do this now for the future of fighting.""  Which, I do agree with that. - We'll make more in the long run."
J28sXDIjX7k,1024274,1030697,"- Well, you–my point is, you may not even do it,  but the fighters coming behind you will benefit.  - Exactly. The next generation. - You have to be okay with that."
J28sXDIjX7k,1030739,1036995,- Exactly.  - I'm not the biggest fan of America.  This is one of the things we do great is a union.
J28sXDIjX7k,1037037,1042292,We will negotiate on some fools. Every–  [laughter]
J28sXDIjX7k,1042334,1047756,- I love how she says it though. - Every union has gone through this.  Every single union.
J28sXDIjX7k,1047798,1055889,"I think you are a million percent correct. It is 1,000% possible.  And yeah, like, people will be poor for a minute, and that's part of it."
J28sXDIjX7k,1055931,1063897,"It's part of it.  It's–you know, the only– - Here's the thing. Time out. All right?  I'll call upon the ten biggest boxers– ten highest-paid boxers"
J28sXDIjX7k,1063939,1069987,"and ten highest-paid people from the UFC.  Yo, why can't you donate $200,000 to the union"
J28sXDIjX7k,1070028,1076952,"to help pay these fighters for these six months?  Are you that selfish?  Floyd Mayweather, Canelo, who makes 50 million for a fight."
J28sXDIjX7k,1076994,1081998,"Canelo, you can't donate $200,000 to this union?  I'll donate 500,000. I'll donate a million."
J28sXDIjX7k,1082040,1087504,- To pay them whether or not they– - I'll throw in a million  so that we can pay– - You're in for a million?  - I'm in for a million.
J28sXDIjX7k,1087546,1093635,I'm in for–I could raise more than that.  But I'm saying that– the money that we put into the union
J28sXDIjX7k,1093677,1099516,"can help pay the fighters who aren't getting paid  as much in the interim, and that's how it could be funded."
J28sXDIjX7k,1099558,1105647,"- Well, it's very interesting, though, because, obviously,  people have a lot of different perceptions of you–  fights, partying."
J28sXDIjX7k,1105689,1110819,"You've had, obviously, controversies and things.  But it's interesting to hear you say that, like, as a human, you are growing."
J28sXDIjX7k,1110861,1116950,"How old are you? Just 25, right? - I'm 25.  - Oh. - But no, like–like you said,  it's like my– [both laugh]"
J28sXDIjX7k,1116992,1124541,"- People shouldn't be hitting you. You're a child.  - Nah– [laughter]  Well, I–yeah, I grew up on camera, so anything I did wrong–"
J28sXDIjX7k,1124583,1131381,"like, and by the way, I was doing stuff wrong and–  - As every teenager does.  - Yeah, and fighting has helped me mature and become a different person."
J28sXDIjX7k,1131423,1137971,"But it is, like you said, like, you know, I messed up and did stupid shit  that I'm not proud of. - [laughs]"
J28sXDIjX7k,1138013,1145312,"- I'm 40, I'm still fucked up.  - I'm saying yesterday, dang.  I feel like when I was young, those jokes– man, fuck."
J28sXDIjX7k,1145354,1150776,Thank God nobody was taping that shit.  It was horrible garbage. Horrible garbage.
J28sXDIjX7k,1150817,1159575,"But I feel like, especially in comedy,  you say some rancid, rancid shit because it gets laughs."
J28sXDIjX7k,1159618,1166124,"Any time you say– you know, like when you were a kid  and you went ""poo-poo.""  And everyone would be like, ""Ah, this is the best.  Don't worry. This is hilarious."""
J28sXDIjX7k,1166166,1172840,"And then it's that same element.  And when you get older, then it's the same type of garbage"
J28sXDIjX7k,1172881,1181265,"that gets you cred for being, you know, edgy.  And you don't realize that that's garbage until you're a little bit older."
J28sXDIjX7k,1181306,1186395,"- And by living in, like, the world we're living, obviously–  censorship, cancel culture, all those things–"
J28sXDIjX7k,1186436,1192317,is anything going too far in comedy?  - I feel like what a lot of people are calling cancel culture
J28sXDIjX7k,1192359,1197614,"is just accountability, you know?  And I don't think we can just be"
J28sXDIjX7k,1197656,1204329,"shitting on everybody all the time anymore.  It used to be anything goes, and now it doesn't.  And that's great, 'cause guess what?"
J28sXDIjX7k,1204371,1210627,It used to be cool to not hire me because how I look.  - Of course. - You know?  So I can't be–I can't be mad at that.
J28sXDIjX7k,1210669,1216216,"I think that we as a people are evolving, and it'll take some people a long time."
J28sXDIjX7k,1216258,1222347,Some people are there already.  But it is that journey that we're all in right now.
J28sXDIjX7k,1222389,1228102,"And yeah, it feels bad and weird.  Who cares? Getting better feels bad.  Also, like, people go,"
J28sXDIjX7k,1228145,1235903,"""Oh, I can't be rac– I can't be the one who did the bad thing.""  But if society as a whole is–"
J28sXDIjX7k,1235944,1243869,"I'm so sorry that I've come to this.  - [laughs] We're here. Go for it.  - If society as a whole is built on white supremacy, which it is,"
J28sXDIjX7k,1243911,1249708,then we cannot act like we are all above it.
J28sXDIjX7k,1249750,1256840,We're in it. We're in it.  It's in the very fabric of our lives.  It's how we live. It's on the fucking money.
J28sXDIjX7k,1256882,1263347,"It's everywhere, and I think... - [laughs]  - That's more of the thing.  It's not like, ""You were a bad dude and you did this"
J28sXDIjX7k,1263388,1271146,"and you are bad and it's tarnished on you forever.""  That's not it.  It's like, ""Yeah, I'm a product of society, what do you fucking want?"
J28sXDIjX7k,1271188,1277277,"""So yeah, thank you for giving me the opportunity to get there.  Take me with you.""  - Let me ask you, when you go on every night,"
J28sXDIjX7k,1277319,1283325,"there's never been many women in late night.  Do you feel that pressure of, like,  especially as a Black woman, going on every night?"
J28sXDIjX7k,1283367,1289748,"- I'm a 40-year-old Black lady from Omaha, Nebraska.  I don't feel a need to, like, represent everybody."
J28sXDIjX7k,1289790,1295169,"I can't.  If Black people– if Black women were a monolith,  I absolutely could and I'd love to do it."
J28sXDIjX7k,1295212,1302261,"But we're not, so I can't.  - Just to go back on the cancel culture thing,  it's like, if people wanna have cancel culture and cancel somebody,"
J28sXDIjX7k,1302302,1307850,"cool, you know?  You did something wrong, maybe apologize for it. Whatever.  You offended a bunch of people."
J28sXDIjX7k,1307891,1315148,But then that same society should give that same person  the opportunity to grow and change.
J28sXDIjX7k,1315190,1321613,"""That was wrong. Don't do that again.""  And, you know, give them the opportunity to realize what they did was wrong."
J28sXDIjX7k,1321655,1328370,But that's the problem with cancel culture is it just–it needs to be so definite.  Society likes to place things in boxes.
J28sXDIjX7k,1328412,1335002,"Jake Paul is this, you know? Maverick Carter is this.  Cancel on this.  No, like, that's not how it is."
J28sXDIjX7k,1335043,1341091,- But it's also the jumping on the bandwagon with social media  where a lot of people are just voicing an opinion
J28sXDIjX7k,1341133,1346889,"without having the full facts 'cause they wanna be down.  - Exactly. - You know?  It's like, I release an album"
J28sXDIjX7k,1346930,1352895,"and you see some dudes like, dissecting my music immediately."
J28sXDIjX7k,1352936,1358399,"The shit just came out.  [laughter]  Like, it took me two years to record this album,"
J28sXDIjX7k,1358442,1365574,"and you're immediately like, ""That shit wack.""  I don't expect everyone to love what I do, but I think there's a difference"
J28sXDIjX7k,1365616,1370704,between constructive criticism and straight up just bullying and hating.
J28sXDIjX7k,1370746,1377878,"- Mm-hmm.  - So I think that that has a lot to do with it, too,  that people just–they want that clout."
J28sXDIjX7k,1377920,1385384,"- That cred, yeah. - You know?  Like, these motherfuckers are doing podcasts in their rooms  like they're experts in music."
J28sXDIjX7k,1385427,1393769,"- I receive comments sometime– whether it's a DM or a comment–  and people will break down, tell you how you should train"
J28sXDIjX7k,1393810,1399398,"and how you should fight. - Mm-hmm.  - [laughs] Yes.  - Like, I put a video of me, like, hitting meat,"
J28sXDIjX7k,1399441,1404820,"and the guy will be like, ""No, work more on your wrestling.  ""You have to see this coach.  And it works like this, like that, like that."""
J28sXDIjX7k,1404863,1410744,"I'm like, ""Whoa, hold on a minute. What is your record?""  Like, how– - [laughs]  - This guy never fight in his life."
J28sXDIjX7k,1410786,1418293,"He never been in the gym, you know? - Uh-huh.  - You are working your ass every day, twice a day, or whatever. You know?"
J28sXDIjX7k,1418335,1423924,"- [laughs]  - Yeah, like, ""I can hear he's uninspired.  I can hear, like""– You can't hear shit, you know?"
J28sXDIjX7k,1423966,1430179,"- So, Romeo, by the way, talking about Latin music,  it's always been big, but now you've got like all the new artists–  Bad Bunny, [mumbles]."
J28sXDIjX7k,1430222,1437187,What's the difference what they're going through now and dealing with  versus when you first started?  'Cause you've been around a very long time.
J28sXDIjX7k,1437229,1442442,"- Shit. The bag.  - The bag got bigger, right? - The bag.  I mean, no, but all jokes aside,"
J28sXDIjX7k,1442484,1448490,"you know, I think that especially urban music  is living a momentum that's amazing."
J28sXDIjX7k,1448532,1453954,Like–and the digital just changed absolutely everything in a good way.
J28sXDIjX7k,1455831,1462337,"Guys like Bad Bunny...  Balvin, Ozuna,"
J28sXDIjX7k,1462379,1470345,"you know, they kind of inspired other artists like,  ""Okay, we can become successful,"""
J28sXDIjX7k,1470387,1477060,"and a lot faster than in my generation.  You know, before I even reached stardom,"
J28sXDIjX7k,1477102,1484443,"I was already doing local group– like, local clubs,  shit like that for, like, five years."
J28sXDIjX7k,1484484,1490032,"You know, the industry has changed so drastically that it's like,"
J28sXDIjX7k,1490073,1495829,"""Yo, you could become un fenómeno""...  - Yeah. - [speaking Spanish]"
J28sXDIjX7k,1495871,1502127,"- Off a hit on Soundcloud. - Yeah.  - One song. Yeah. - Like, I'm talking about, like,  these guys have– like, I remember speaking to Ozuna"
J28sXDIjX7k,1502169,1508300,"when he was just starting.  Like, a year and a half later... he was a superstar."
J28sXDIjX7k,1508342,1514680,"- And you've collaborated with a lot of artists.  Like, who was the one that surprised the fuck out of you?  Like, ""Damn, that's some shit I didn't exp–"""
J28sXDIjX7k,1514723,1520729,They went to a level you didn't know they were gonna go to.  - So I produced and wrote a record
J28sXDIjX7k,1520771,1526485,"for my second solo album with Marc Anthony.  It was a salsa,"
J28sXDIjX7k,1526527,1536370,"which is not–no mi fuerte.  You know, I'm a bachatero. I do bachata.  But I'm a huge fan of salsa as well."
J28sXDIjX7k,1536411,1544002,"And for him to trust me in producing and songwriting a salsa  for me was, like, surreal."
J28sXDIjX7k,1544044,1551301,"And I recall being in the studio with Marc  just guiding him, like– by the way, he doesn't need no guidance,"
J28sXDIjX7k,1551343,1559518,"but, you know, I'm like,  ""Yo, could you do it like this? Could you do it like that?""  And I'm so passionate about this shit that I'm a bit intense at moments."
J28sXDIjX7k,1559560,1565691,"And I remember that once we were done with the session,  he was like, ""Bro, I can't remember the last time"
J28sXDIjX7k,1565732,1574658,"""that I was in a studio session this long  and motherfucker's telling me, 'Yo, could you do the slogan like this?'"""
J28sXDIjX7k,1574700,1581247,"And that was, for me, a surreal moment just because I grew up on Marc."
J28sXDIjX7k,1581290,1587671,"Like, I just grew up, like,  wow, this guy, to me, was, like, unreachable."
J28sXDIjX7k,1587713,1594344,"And to be able to write, produce a song with him,  like, that's just crazy to me."
J28sXDIjX7k,1594386,1602019,"That was a very special moment.  - Jake, have you had some boxers reached out to you that you're like,  ""Damn, I can't believe that boxer reached out to me"
J28sXDIjX7k,1602060,1610527,"with some advice or some...""  - Yeah, look, I mean, there's been a ton of support,  which is crazy and I think the biggest one,"
J28sXDIjX7k,1610569,1617075,"who is one of my idols, is Mike Tyson.  He's taken me under his wing in some sorts, you know?"
J28sXDIjX7k,1617117,1623664,"We've partied together. He's given me advice.  Like, he's such a– - [laughs]  - Such a dope, dope guy. - Party with Mike."
J28sXDIjX7k,1623707,1629796,"[laughs]  - Evander Holyfield.  You know, Devin Haney. Ryan Garcia. David Benavidez."
J28sXDIjX7k,1629838,1638722,"-They've taken you in as, like, ""You're one of us""?  - Yeah, I'll be DMing Benavidez like,  ""Yo, like, what would you recommend for this sort of workout?"" Da, da, da."
J28sXDIjX7k,1638764,1643852,"And he'll, like, give me advice and I implement it.  So... - Does that give you self-validation"
J28sXDIjX7k,1643894,1648898,knowing that these guys are the real fucking guys and giants  are welcoming you into their fraternity?
J28sXDIjX7k,1648941,1656156,"- No, yeah, it means a lot and it's dope, you know?  And they've all been so awesome to me and I appreciate that."
J28sXDIjX7k,1656198,1662329,"It means a lot.  And, you know, they're not haters, you know?  'Cause there's a lot of people at first in the boxing world"
J28sXDIjX7k,1662371,1668836,"who were like, ""Oh, I don't know.""  And there's still people who are like, ""Oh, I don't know.  I don't know about this.""  But the fact that they are showing love,"
J28sXDIjX7k,1668877,1676677,"you know, that is all the motivation and proof that I need.  - Think it'll always be like that and we will always have those people."
J28sXDIjX7k,1676718,1682015,"That's what make the community. That's what make your friend base.  You can't pick, like, ""Okay, I just want a good guy."""
J28sXDIjX7k,1682057,1687813,There's always bad-guy haters be in between.  You have to deal with them. You have to learn how to deal with them
J28sXDIjX7k,1687855,1694570,"or ignore them and move on.  And doesn't matter how good you are.  You might become the best person on Earth,"
J28sXDIjX7k,1694611,1702870,"but you will always have criticism.  You're gonna have, like, a hundred people liking you.  You're gonna find someone like, ""Oh, he's this. He's that. Oh, he's""–"
J28sXDIjX7k,1702911,1710294,"and that can't change.  - I cannot believe how true that is.  Like, if a thousand people are like, ""This the shit."""
J28sXDIjX7k,1710335,1715883,"Those ten motherfuckers who are like– - Oh, yeah.  Sometimes it's one. It's enough. - Like, what is that?"
J28sXDIjX7k,1715924,1722681,"- When you see those kind of comment, look at the reply.  You know, you will find your real friend reply and go after."
J28sXDIjX7k,1722723,1729229,- Do you ever reply to them?  - From my fake account.  [laughter]
J28sXDIjX7k,1729271,1735819,"- No, you don't! Delete that account now!  - I ain't gonna win. I ain't gonna win. I ain't gonna win."
J28sXDIjX7k,1735861,1742409,"No, listen, and I have to be honest.  That shit feels good.  [laughter]"
J28sXDIjX7k,1742451,1751293,"He says, ""You suck.""  Shit. [laughter]  Oh, man.  - I don't reply, but most of the time, my fan reply to those."
J28sXDIjX7k,1751335,1757174,You know? And then I will look at it...  - And you like it. It makes you feel good.  - My fan defends me.
J28sXDIjX7k,1757216,1765641,"- Can I just say...  mad props to the optimism, man. - Cheers.  - Every time we say something negative or something like that–"
J28sXDIjX7k,1765682,1771730,"- I was gonna say that. You know, Romeo– - Mad props.  - 7 billion people on the planet, he can kick everybody's ass, right?"
J28sXDIjX7k,1771772,1777110,I have no idea after sitting with him  how the fuck he gets in a rage to go fight somebody.
J28sXDIjX7k,1777152,1783283,- That's a question I had. When you're fighting someone–  I'm so sorry that this might sound very silly–
J28sXDIjX7k,1783325,1789164,"do you feel angry? - You're mad at them.  - Or is it, like, a– - It's a job.  - It's a job. - It's a job."
J28sXDIjX7k,1789206,1795461,"- You can't be angry. You'll get tired. You have to be calm.  - Do they ever make you angry, though?  - You don't have to be angry."
J28sXDIjX7k,1795504,1801510,"Like, me, it's really hard to get me angry.  I just know the reason why. - We know.  - Yeah, we've picked that up."
J28sXDIjX7k,1801552,1808684,"- I just have to remind myself why I'm fighting.  When you come from a small village from a country like Cameroon,"
J28sXDIjX7k,1808725,1816233,"nobody expect you to become a world champion.  From where I came from, we weren't even allowed to have a dream."
J28sXDIjX7k,1816275,1823323,"That's why, like, anytime when I have a chance,  I just go back home.  It's at the moment that I kind of, like, realize–"
J28sXDIjX7k,1823365,1830414,"kind of collect myself, realize, like, where I'm from, you know?  - That's dope. And, you know, like, you just..."
J28sXDIjX7k,1830455,1838881,"I remember this for a second.  Like, I sold out two Yankee Stadiums  and, you know, sometimes it takes a while for you to digest,"
J28sXDIjX7k,1838922,1846096,"you know, like, those moments that they mean a lot to people,  but also, you know, you should enjoy every moment,"
J28sXDIjX7k,1846138,1852143,"every successful moment. - Exactly.  - And my uncle said something to me.  He was like, ""Are you ready?"""
J28sXDIjX7k,1852186,1857691,"Like, he tells me, ""Are you ready to tell your kids, like,"
J28sXDIjX7k,1857733,1864823,"how this felt?""  And I'm like, ""Oh, shit.""  Like, sometimes you get caught up with the production."
J28sXDIjX7k,1864865,1871038,"- Your craft. - And the moment.  - Yeah, and, you know,  and then you're like, ""Oh, shit, like, this is, you know""–"
J28sXDIjX7k,1871079,1876418,"So that's deep. I could relate to that.  - Then you are like, ""Okay, this is the real shit."""
J28sXDIjX7k,1876460,1883258,"You know, I remember, like, when I first won the belt,  I went back home and was living my normal life."
J28sXDIjX7k,1883300,1888680,"And then sometime at night, I'm like,  ""I'm a world champion, right? I have a belt."""
J28sXDIjX7k,1888722,1894227,"So I will go check, like, ""Am I dreaming, or it's true?""  [laughter] Because for me, it was just, like..."
J28sXDIjX7k,1894269,1901026,"- Wow. - Nothing changed.  I'm like, ""Okay, why I'm not feeling a change?  Like, why life is just so normal?"""
J28sXDIjX7k,1901068,1907407,"I just looked at it, I'm like, ""Okay, so if the belt is here,  that means I'm a world champion.""  But you don't realize it. - Yes. You don't realize it."
J28sXDIjX7k,1907449,1915082,"- Of course. - But the champ, by the way,  no matter how much he gets paid fighting,  he can make a lot more as a therapist and a motivational fucking speaker."
J28sXDIjX7k,1915123,1920211,"I think you've got two clients already.  And with that, we're a wrap. Thank you, everyone."
J28sXDIjX7k,1920254,1928387,"- Yay. [applause]  - [singing] I don't wanna die for them to miss me  - Romeo Santos was, like, 20% of my playlist."
J28sXDIjX7k,1928428,1934101,- [laughs] - Hey.  - Enrique Iglesias and Prince Royce.  - You have good taste in music.
J28sXDIjX7k,1934142,1940273,[laughter]  You're invited to my next show.  - We gotta make that happen. - I'ma fuck with you.  just don't fuck me up.
J28sXDIjX7k,1940315,1947698,"[laughter]  - [singing] Sometimes I don't, ayy, don't  I finessed down Weston Road, ayy, 'nessed"
J28sXDIjX7k,1947739,1952828,"Might go down a G.O.D., yeah, wait  I make sure that north-side eat"
J28sXDIjX7k,1954121,1955372,And still
