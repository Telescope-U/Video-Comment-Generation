-fizUVHGHsg,3916,6250,"You see, what happens is this then:"
-fizUVHGHsg,6250,8458,that an individual who all his life long 
-fizUVHGHsg,8458,13791,has played the social game
-fizUVHGHsg,13791,17083,"then says: ""Well, now I've done that,"
-fizUVHGHsg,17083,20083,"I have assumed this role, I have become identified "
-fizUVHGHsg,20083,23833,"with tinker, tailer, soldier, sailer, whatever it was ..."
-fizUVHGHsg,23833,26875,... but now: 'Who am I?' ... really!
-fizUVHGHsg,26875,30166,In order to find that out I have to go off by myself. 
-fizUVHGHsg,30166,31708,Why?
-fizUVHGHsg,31708,35125,Because ... 
-fizUVHGHsg,35125,37291,"you have a role conception, "
-fizUVHGHsg,37291,41083,a mask conception of yourself ...
-fizUVHGHsg,41083,44708,because other people tell you who you are!
-fizUVHGHsg,44708,47791,"If belief is a construct than like any other construct, "
-fizUVHGHsg,47791,50791,it can be manipulated and changed
-fizUVHGHsg,50791,52166,"And at any moment, "
-fizUVHGHsg,52166,55333,you can choose to believe something new about yourself.
-fizUVHGHsg,55333,56875,"Now, the weird thing about belief is "
-fizUVHGHsg,56875,59250,as soon as you change that belief it becomes true.
-fizUVHGHsg,59250,59958,Why that is?
-fizUVHGHsg,59958,63833,I will never quite understand what weird quirk of human evolution
-fizUVHGHsg,63833,67458,has left us in a space where simply believing it makes it true
-fizUVHGHsg,67458,69791,"If you think you're dumb, guess what?"
-fizUVHGHsg,69791,70875,You're dumb.
-fizUVHGHsg,70875,72750,And you will act in accordance with that belief 
-fizUVHGHsg,72750,75291,and that should scare the sh*t out of you.
-fizUVHGHsg,75291,78375,"So if you think about it, people wake up in the morning."
-fizUVHGHsg,78375,81916,They begin to think about their problems.
-fizUVHGHsg,81916,85666,Those problems are circuits memories in the brain.
-fizUVHGHsg,85666,89125,Each one of those memories are connected to people 
-fizUVHGHsg,89125,91250,and things at certain times and places.
-fizUVHGHsg,91250,93708,"And if the brain is a record of the past,"
-fizUVHGHsg,93708,95541,"the moment they start their day,"
-fizUVHGHsg,95541,97416,they're already thinking in the past 
-fizUVHGHsg,97416,100291,each one of those memories has emotions
-fizUVHGHsg,100291,103500,Emotions are the end product of past experiences.
-fizUVHGHsg,103500,106250,"So the moment they recall those memories of their problems, "
-fizUVHGHsg,106250,107750,they all of a sudden feel unhappy.
-fizUVHGHsg,107750,109958,"They feel sad, they feel pain."
-fizUVHGHsg,109958,113916,Now how you think and how you  feel creates your state of being 
-fizUVHGHsg,113916,116583,so the person's entire state of being 
-fizUVHGHsg,116583,118791,when they start their days in the past.
-fizUVHGHsg,118791,119541,So what does that mean?
-fizUVHGHsg,119541,123791,The familiar past will sooner or later be predictable future.
-fizUVHGHsg,123791,128666,So if you believe that your thoughts have something to do with your destiny.
-fizUVHGHsg,128666,131875,And you can't think greater than how you feel 
-fizUVHGHsg,131875,134458,or feelings have become the means of thinking 
-fizUVHGHsg,134458,137750,"by very definition of emotions, you're thinking in the past,  "
-fizUVHGHsg,137750,140750,"and for the most part, you're going to keep creating the same life."
-fizUVHGHsg,140750,145125,"So then people grab their cell phone, they check their WhatsApp, they check their texts,"
-fizUVHGHsg,145125,148583,"they check their emails, they check Facebook, they take a picture "
-fizUVHGHsg,148583,149708,They post it on Facebook.
-fizUVHGHsg,149708,154165,"They tweet something, they do Instagram, they check the news and now they feel really"
-fizUVHGHsg,154166,156916,connected to everything that's known in their life.
-fizUVHGHsg,156916,160541,And then they go through a series of routine behaviors.
-fizUVHGHsg,160541,164250,"They get out of bed on the same side, they go to the toilet, they get a cup of coffee, "
-fizUVHGHsg,164250,166916,"they take a shower, they get dressed, they drive to work the same way."
-fizUVHGHsg,166916,167958,They do the same things.
-fizUVHGHsg,167958,169540,They see the same people 
-fizUVHGHsg,169541,172958,"that push the same emotional buttons, and that becomes"
-fizUVHGHsg,172958,175500,the routine and it becomes like a program.
-fizUVHGHsg,175500,178291,So now they've lost their free will
-fizUVHGHsg,178291,182291,to a program and there's no unseen hand doing it to them.
-fizUVHGHsg,182291,186750,"So when it comes time to change, the redundancy of that cycle"
-fizUVHGHsg,186750,188625,becomes a subconscious program.
-fizUVHGHsg,188625,194208,So now 95% of who we are by the time we're 35 years old 
-fizUVHGHsg,194208,197165,"is a memorized set of behaviors, emotional reactions,"
-fizUVHGHsg,197166,201083,"unconscious habits, hardwired  attitudes, beliefs and perceptions"
-fizUVHGHsg,201083,204040,that function like a computer program.
-fizUVHGHsg,204041,205791,The mind 
-fizUVHGHsg,205791,208541,is the matrix in and of itself
-fizUVHGHsg,208541,212708,"Right now, today in this moment, I promise you"
-fizUVHGHsg,212708,215250,The matrix has you
-fizUVHGHsg,215250,217875,If you guys know David Foster Wallace's concept of 
-fizUVHGHsg,217875,219291,"“this is water,” "
-fizUVHGHsg,219291,223916,"to a fish, water is so ubiquitous it ceases to exist."
-fizUVHGHsg,223916,225500,"Now, we all have that same thing, "
-fizUVHGHsg,225500,229708,and it’s playing on us and it’s keeping us  from becoming who we want to become. 
-fizUVHGHsg,229708,231458,That thing is our mindset. 
-fizUVHGHsg,231458,234415,"It’s our belief system. It is so ever-present, "
-fizUVHGHsg,234416,237541,it is so ingrained into the fabric of who you are 
-fizUVHGHsg,237541,240125,"and the way that you process data, "
-fizUVHGHsg,240125,241750,you don’t even notice it. 
-fizUVHGHsg,241750,243375,You don’t even know that it’s real. 
-fizUVHGHsg,243375,245750,This is the thing that impacts your life.
-fizUVHGHsg,245750,250000,"It is your inability to see that your  mindset controls everything, "
-fizUVHGHsg,250000,252291,that it is water in and of itself.
-fizUVHGHsg,252291,255041,"When I heard this from Shakespeare, I realized "
-fizUVHGHsg,255041,256790,"that once you become aware of the water, "
-fizUVHGHsg,256790,260250,you can change everything. 
-fizUVHGHsg,260250,265666,"So then a person can say with their 5% of their conscious mind, I want to be healthy,"
-fizUVHGHsg,265666,267916,"I want to be happy, I want to be free"
-fizUVHGHsg,267916,270625,but the body's on a whole different program.
-fizUVHGHsg,270625,273208,So then how do you begin to make those changes?
-fizUVHGHsg,273208,277041,"Well, you have to get beyond  the analytical mind because "
-fizUVHGHsg,277041,280375,what separates the conscious mind  from the subconscious mind 
-fizUVHGHsg,280375,281916,is the analytical mind.
-fizUVHGHsg,281916,285166,And that's where meditation comes in because you can teach people
-fizUVHGHsg,285166,289000,"through practice, how to change their brainwaves, slow them down."
-fizUVHGHsg,289000,292500,"And when they do that properly, they do enter the operating system where they can"
-fizUVHGHsg,292500,294916,begin to make some really important changes.
-fizUVHGHsg,294916,295957,"So, "
-fizUVHGHsg,295958,300041,most people then wait for crisis or trauma or disease or diagnosis.
-fizUVHGHsg,300041,304250,"They wait for loss, some tragedy to make up their mind to change."
-fizUVHGHsg,304250,306125,And my message is why wait?
-fizUVHGHsg,306125,309166,"and you can learn and change in a state of pain and suffering, or you can learn and"
-fizUVHGHsg,309166,310916,change in a state of joy and inspiration.
-fizUVHGHsg,310916,314457,I think right now the cool thing is that people are waking up.
