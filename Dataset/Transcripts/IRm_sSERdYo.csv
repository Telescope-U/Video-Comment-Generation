IRm_sSERdYo,2960,4880,all right gang listen up we need a new
IRm_sSERdYo,4880,6720,video idea looking for something fun
IRm_sSERdYo,6720,8960,upbeat mainstream just a hint of
IRm_sSERdYo,8960,10880,nostalgia something that's
IRm_sSERdYo,10880,12559,appreciate the enthusiasm there yoshi
IRm_sSERdYo,12559,14320,but we already did a theory about you we
IRm_sSERdYo,14320,16160,need something fresh something hidden
IRm_sSERdYo,16160,18560,yoshi i told you we've already been over
IRm_sSERdYo,18560,19920,this you're related to a monologue
IRm_sSERdYo,19920,21560,asaurus and a story
IRm_sSERdYo,21560,23279,[Music]
IRm_sSERdYo,23279,26000,what a dragon coin can't seriously think
IRm_sSERdYo,26000,27760,that just because you're on something
IRm_sSERdYo,27760,29599,called a dragon coin it makes you a
IRm_sSERdYo,29599,32080,dragon
IRm_sSERdYo,33120,35600,okay fair point i guess i'll um take
IRm_sSERdYo,35600,38160,another look
IRm_sSERdYo,38960,42000,hello internet welcome to game theory
IRm_sSERdYo,42000,43520,the coolest place to learn about
IRm_sSERdYo,43520,45760,taxonomic classifications you know we've
IRm_sSERdYo,45760,47600,done our fair share of mario videos over
IRm_sSERdYo,47600,49440,the years character by character we've
IRm_sSERdYo,49440,51280,gone through the ranks to suss out their
IRm_sSERdYo,51280,54239,secrets is mario a sociopath is princess
IRm_sSERdYo,54239,57120,peach dead is bowser a deadbeat dad how
IRm_sSERdYo,57120,59280,much of a millionaire is luigi and just
IRm_sSERdYo,59280,61440,how well endowed is he let's just say
IRm_sSERdYo,61440,62719,that certain characters get more
IRm_sSERdYo,62719,64559,favorable coverage than others which
IRm_sSERdYo,64559,66799,brings me to the exciting topic for
IRm_sSERdYo,66799,69360,today's episode yoshi the sticky tongue
IRm_sSERdYo,69360,71200,devoid of death that's always ready to
IRm_sSERdYo,71200,72960,sacrifice his life so that you can get
IRm_sSERdYo,72960,75520,that much closer to once again missing
IRm_sSERdYo,75520,77439,the jump over the lava yoshi is such an
IRm_sSERdYo,77439,79119,iconic part of the mario series at this
IRm_sSERdYo,79119,80479,point that it only made sense to do a
IRm_sSERdYo,80479,82320,theory on him which is exactly what i
IRm_sSERdYo,82320,84720,did back in 2020. in that video i tried
IRm_sSERdYo,84720,86799,to figure out what yoshi actually is
IRm_sSERdYo,86799,88400,using prominent physical features like
IRm_sSERdYo,88400,90640,his face shape and this random red frill
IRm_sSERdYo,90640,92159,down his back all of it led me to
IRm_sSERdYo,92159,94079,determine that yoshi was most likely
IRm_sSERdYo,94079,95759,related to the monolofosaurus a
IRm_sSERdYo,95759,98320,medium-sized bipedal dinosaur that has
IRm_sSERdYo,98320,100079,the same round face shape the same
IRm_sSERdYo,100079,101680,height and lived in roughly the same
IRm_sSERdYo,101680,103840,environments as yoshi all in all it felt
IRm_sSERdYo,103840,106399,like a slam dunk to me science at its
IRm_sSERdYo,106399,108000,finest and it was extra cool because it
IRm_sSERdYo,108000,109360,turned out to be a dinosaur that not
IRm_sSERdYo,109360,111600,many people would have heard of however
IRm_sSERdYo,111600,113840,not everyone was totally happy with that
IRm_sSERdYo,113840,115280,theory because right at the start of the
IRm_sSERdYo,115280,117119,episode i gloss over what is one of the
IRm_sSERdYo,117119,119680,biggest parts of the yoshi debate online
IRm_sSERdYo,119680,122640,is yoshi a dinosaur or is he actually a
IRm_sSERdYo,122640,125280,dragon which may feel like a ridiculous
IRm_sSERdYo,125280,127680,question yoshi is clearly a dinosaur not
IRm_sSERdYo,127680,129840,only did we prove what kind he is but he
IRm_sSERdYo,129840,131680,lives in dinosaur land at least
IRm_sSERdYo,131680,133360,according to super mario world one and
IRm_sSERdYo,133360,135120,two why would you name the land after
IRm_sSERdYo,135120,137040,dinosaurs if the main animal that lives
IRm_sSERdYo,137040,138959,there isn't a dinosaur in the nintendo
IRm_sSERdYo,138959,140959,official guidebook of super mario world
IRm_sSERdYo,140959,143760,yoshi is referred to as a uh editor's
IRm_sSERdYo,143760,145840,translation magic there we go quote
IRm_sSERdYo,145840,148160,gluttony dinosaur yoshi who eats the
IRm_sSERdYo,148160,150000,minions of demon king bowser is a
IRm_sSERdYo,150000,152160,powerful ally to mario and in most of
IRm_sSERdYo,152160,153840,his other appearances like super smash
IRm_sSERdYo,153840,155519,brothers and super smash bros melee he
IRm_sSERdYo,155519,158879,is referred to explicitly as a dinosaur
IRm_sSERdYo,158879,161280,how how is this even a discussion well
IRm_sSERdYo,161280,162800,when you've appeared in as many games as
IRm_sSERdYo,162800,164319,yoshi has it's easy for a few
IRm_sSERdYo,164319,165599,contradictions to slip through the
IRm_sSERdYo,165599,167360,cracks in our previous episode i was
IRm_sSERdYo,167360,168959,only able to find two occurrences of
IRm_sSERdYo,168959,171200,yoshi being called a dragon both of them
IRm_sSERdYo,171200,173120,within the same game in super mario
IRm_sSERdYo,173120,175040,world despite living in dinosaur land
IRm_sSERdYo,175040,177519,yoshi refers to himself as super dragon
IRm_sSERdYo,177519,179280,yoshi at least according to this sign
IRm_sSERdYo,179280,180879,outside of his house he also appears on
IRm_sSERdYo,180879,183120,that game's dragon coins so i just
IRm_sSERdYo,183120,184480,chalked it up to a translationary and i
IRm_sSERdYo,184480,186959,moved on however going deeper into
IRm_sSERdYo,186959,188800,original japanese source materials you
IRm_sSERdYo,188800,190239,start to see that the word dragon
IRm_sSERdYo,190239,192560,appears more and more for instance the
IRm_sSERdYo,192560,194720,manual for super mario world super mario
IRm_sSERdYo,194720,196800,advance 2 introduces yoshi by saying
IRm_sSERdYo,196800,199519,quote a dragon named yoshi or a dragon
IRm_sSERdYo,199519,202239,calling himself yoshi alright so maybe
IRm_sSERdYo,202239,204159,the dragon thing only appears in older
IRm_sSERdYo,204159,206959,games well wrong again he also refers to
IRm_sSERdYo,206959,209360,himself as a dragon as recently as super
IRm_sSERdYo,209360,211920,mario galaxy 2 where on a sign he
IRm_sSERdYo,211920,215040,explicitly says yoshi the space dragon
IRm_sSERdYo,215040,216560,then you have things like his final
IRm_sSERdYo,216560,218640,smash called super dragon and smash
IRm_sSERdYo,218640,220560,brothers brawl and for wii u which
IRm_sSERdYo,220560,222640,causes him to sprout wings and breathe
IRm_sSERdYo,222640,224640,fire so what gives there's tons of
IRm_sSERdYo,224640,226560,evidence suggesting that he's a dinosaur
IRm_sSERdYo,226560,228319,and yet there are plenty of instances of
IRm_sSERdYo,228319,230480,him being classified as a dragon as well
IRm_sSERdYo,230480,232159,and it doesn't appear to be as simple as
IRm_sSERdYo,232159,234319,oh it was just a translation thing or oh
IRm_sSERdYo,234319,236560,those were just the older games it seems
IRm_sSERdYo,236560,238720,like we're back at square one so which
IRm_sSERdYo,238720,240159,isn't nintendo i don't think this could
IRm_sSERdYo,240159,242000,be more convoluted if you tried who do
IRm_sSERdYo,242000,244000,you think you are the fnaf series well
IRm_sSERdYo,244000,245920,having exhausted all the direct evidence
IRm_sSERdYo,245920,247519,that i can see i think it's time we look
IRm_sSERdYo,247519,250319,to other sources indirect sources see
IRm_sSERdYo,250319,252000,throughout the mario games yoshi isn't
IRm_sSERdYo,252000,253680,the only dinosaur-like creature that we
IRm_sSERdYo,253680,255599,encounter so maybe by looking more
IRm_sSERdYo,255599,257120,closely at creatures in the games that
IRm_sSERdYo,257120,259280,share resemblances to yoshi we might be
IRm_sSERdYo,259280,261440,able to get closer to the answer we seek
IRm_sSERdYo,261440,262720,let's start by looking at dory a
IRm_sSERdYo,262720,264560,plesiosaur that first appears in super
IRm_sSERdYo,264560,267680,mario 64. back then dory was nowhere
IRm_sSERdYo,267680,270160,close to resembling a yoshi however as
IRm_sSERdYo,270160,272479,time has gone on she has more and more
IRm_sSERdYo,272479,274479,taking on yoshi-like characteristics
IRm_sSERdYo,274479,276240,fast forward to new super mario bros in
IRm_sSERdYo,276240,278320,2006 and suddenly you can see that dory
IRm_sSERdYo,278320,280320,is looking a lot more familiar there's
IRm_sSERdYo,280320,282960,also plessy from super mario 3d world in
IRm_sSERdYo,282960,285280,2013 who despite the name plessy is
IRm_sSERdYo,285280,287360,ironically enough not a plesiosaur
IRm_sSERdYo,287360,288880,seriously nintendo you've got to get a
IRm_sSERdYo,288880,290400,handle on your dinosaur knowledge it's
IRm_sSERdYo,290400,292080,just embarrassing at this point like
IRm_sSERdYo,292080,294320,yoshi plessy is bipedal making it more
IRm_sSERdYo,294320,296240,likely based on the nothosaur an
IRm_sSERdYo,296240,298560,ancestor to the plesiosaur so looking at
IRm_sSERdYo,298560,300000,these creatures and the real world
IRm_sSERdYo,300000,302240,family tree it's likely the semi-aquatic
IRm_sSERdYo,302240,304639,plessy gave rise to a branching pathway
IRm_sSERdYo,304639,306960,one half went fully aquatic that became
IRm_sSERdYo,306960,308720,dory the other half went fully
IRm_sSERdYo,308720,310960,terrestrial and we got yoshi and if the
IRm_sSERdYo,310960,312320,physical similarities aren't enough
IRm_sSERdYo,312320,314639,yoshi plessy and dory's names all have a
IRm_sSERdYo,314639,316320,connection not the english names the
IRm_sSERdYo,316320,318400,japanese ones all of their japanese
IRm_sSERdYo,318400,319919,names are specifically marked with the
IRm_sSERdYo,319919,322320,ending she dory's official japanese name
IRm_sSERdYo,322320,325199,is doshi and plessies is pureshi yoshi
IRm_sSERdYo,325199,326479,is the only one who got to keep his name
IRm_sSERdYo,326479,328240,in the western release so between the
IRm_sSERdYo,328240,329919,name similarities and the physical
IRm_sSERdYo,329919,331360,similarities it feels like we're
IRm_sSERdYo,331360,333840,building a family tree so then this
IRm_sSERdYo,333840,335360,would seem to confirm that yoshi is a
IRm_sSERdYo,335360,337199,dinosaur right
IRm_sSERdYo,337199,339600,no neither plesiosaurus nor northosaurus
IRm_sSERdYo,339600,341680,are technically considered dinosaurs
IRm_sSERdYo,341680,343120,instead they're referred to as surround
IRm_sSERdYo,343120,345120,pterygian reptiles ancient marine
IRm_sSERdYo,345120,346639,reptiles that ruled the oceans while
IRm_sSERdYo,346639,348400,dinosaurs roamed the land they're
IRm_sSERdYo,348400,351280,thought to be the ancestors to dinosaurs
IRm_sSERdYo,351280,353039,so yoshi's a descendant of the ancient
IRm_sSERdYo,353039,354560,marine reptiles that we've seen in the
IRm_sSERdYo,354560,356479,games making him pretty darn close to
IRm_sSERdYo,356479,358880,dinosaur status right well no cause
IRm_sSERdYo,358880,361199,there's one teeny tiny fire breathing
IRm_sSERdYo,361199,363520,problem bahamut who's bahamut well
IRm_sSERdYo,363520,365120,before i can tell you about him i first
IRm_sSERdYo,365120,366400,need to tell you that this portion of
IRm_sSERdYo,366400,368479,the video was sponsored by nitsa while
IRm_sSERdYo,368479,370080,riding dinosaur dragging creatures
IRm_sSERdYo,370080,371680,around may seem fun and all it's
IRm_sSERdYo,371680,372960,probably not the safest mode of
IRm_sSERdYo,372960,374720,transportation where are the seat belts
IRm_sSERdYo,374720,376080,what if my dinosaur gets into a
IRm_sSERdYo,376080,378080,collision with a rampant turtle shell at
IRm_sSERdYo,378080,379440,minimum a seat belt's going to ensure
IRm_sSERdYo,379440,381120,that i'm not being launched off while he
IRm_sSERdYo,381120,383280,runs away but all joking aside car
IRm_sSERdYo,383280,385600,safety is important cars are obviously
IRm_sSERdYo,385600,386880,an essential part of life but that can
IRm_sSERdYo,386880,388319,mean that we sometimes forget how
IRm_sSERdYo,388319,390560,dangerous the roads can be seat belts
IRm_sSERdYo,390560,392800,help save lives wearing your seatbelt is
IRm_sSERdYo,392800,394639,a surefire way of keeping you safe while
IRm_sSERdYo,394639,396479,you're driving i'm sure most of you at
IRm_sSERdYo,396479,397680,this point are familiar with my wife
IRm_sSERdYo,397680,399840,stephanie well her dad's life was
IRm_sSERdYo,399840,402000,literally saved by a seat belt a driver
IRm_sSERdYo,402000,403440,plowed into the back of his car when he
IRm_sSERdYo,403440,405759,was in his 20s his car absolutely
IRm_sSERdYo,405759,407039,totaled to the extent that he had to
IRm_sSERdYo,407039,409120,basically be peeled out of a twisted
IRm_sSERdYo,409120,411199,ball of metal and the officer on the job
IRm_sSERdYo,411199,413120,said the only reason that he was able to
IRm_sSERdYo,413120,415680,survive was because of his seatbelt and
IRm_sSERdYo,415680,417360,without that one click steph's father
IRm_sSERdYo,417360,419280,wouldn't be here steph wouldn't be here
IRm_sSERdYo,419280,420800,i would have never met her she would
IRm_sSERdYo,420800,422000,have never encouraged me to try
IRm_sSERdYo,422000,423440,something other than theater i wouldn't
IRm_sSERdYo,423440,425039,have done youtube and none of this
IRm_sSERdYo,425039,427039,channel would exist all of it because of
IRm_sSERdYo,427039,429440,one click of a seat belt so do your part
IRm_sSERdYo,429440,431360,to keep the roads and yourself safe
IRm_sSERdYo,431360,433199,buckle up each and every trip that you
IRm_sSERdYo,433199,434800,take and encourage your loved ones to do
IRm_sSERdYo,434800,435919,the same if you want to learn more about
IRm_sSERdYo,435919,437520,the campaign please go to the website in
IRm_sSERdYo,437520,438880,the top line of the description and
IRm_sSERdYo,438880,440880,remember click it don't risk it thank
IRm_sSERdYo,440880,442319,you once again to nitsa for sponsoring
IRm_sSERdYo,442319,443759,that portion of the episode now it's
IRm_sSERdYo,443759,445919,back to yoshi or actually now it's back
IRm_sSERdYo,445919,447919,to bahamut no idea who i'm talking about
IRm_sSERdYo,447919,449759,honestly not surprised he only appeared
IRm_sSERdYo,449759,453039,in one game back in 1996 super mario rpg
IRm_sSERdYo,453039,455280,legend of the seven stars brilliant game
IRm_sSERdYo,455280,457199,actually might be my favorite mario game
IRm_sSERdYo,457199,459520,of all time anyway in it bahamut is a
IRm_sSERdYo,459520,461440,massive ancient dragon who serves as one
IRm_sSERdYo,461440,463280,of the enemies but just like plessy he
IRm_sSERdYo,463280,465199,shares the same bulbous head the same
IRm_sSERdYo,465199,467440,color pattern he's even bipedal looking
IRm_sSERdYo,467440,469039,at him other than the wings it's hard to
IRm_sSERdYo,469039,471440,deny that bahamut looks more similar to
IRm_sSERdYo,471440,473919,yoshi than either plessy or dory however
IRm_sSERdYo,473919,475039,what's more important than his
IRm_sSERdYo,475039,476720,appearance is the fact that his japanese
IRm_sSERdYo,476720,478800,name is the same as dory's doshi heard
IRm_sSERdYo,478800,480400,that right bahamut the ancient
IRm_sSERdYo,480400,482319,aggressive fire-breathing dragon shares
IRm_sSERdYo,482319,484319,the same japanese name with a peaceful
IRm_sSERdYo,484319,486960,friendly water taxi and thus some sort
IRm_sSERdYo,486960,489039,of lineage with yoshi all of this means
IRm_sSERdYo,489039,491280,that uh that uh honestly we're no closer
IRm_sSERdYo,491280,493120,to solving the mystery darn it nintendo
IRm_sSERdYo,493120,494879,no matter what way you slice it yoshi
IRm_sSERdYo,494879,496960,doesn't fit cleanly into either category
IRm_sSERdYo,496960,498960,he's bipedal like bahamut and plessy he
IRm_sSERdYo,498960,500879,can swim just like plessy and dory we've
IRm_sSERdYo,500879,502479,seen him grow wings to make him even
IRm_sSERdYo,502479,504400,more closely resemble bahamut and he
IRm_sSERdYo,504400,506319,shares the same head and color patterns
IRm_sSERdYo,506319,508160,of all three how am i supposed to be
IRm_sSERdYo,508160,510000,able to put him into one category but
IRm_sSERdYo,510000,511520,that's when it hit me what if we didn't
IRm_sSERdYo,511520,513360,have to choose what if the reason yoshi
IRm_sSERdYo,513360,514959,doesn't fit into one or the other is
IRm_sSERdYo,514959,517599,because he's both what if yoshi is a
IRm_sSERdYo,517599,519680,hybrid i know this sounds like a cop-out
IRm_sSERdYo,519680,520959,but it's actually a really fascinating
IRm_sSERdYo,520959,522719,part of the biological world a common
IRm_sSERdYo,522719,524560,hybrid that we all just accept at this
IRm_sSERdYo,524560,526240,point is the mule the offspring of a
IRm_sSERdYo,526240,528399,female horse and a male donkey these
IRm_sSERdYo,528399,529680,creatures were often bred because they
IRm_sSERdYo,529680,531200,were stronger than a horse of a similar
IRm_sSERdYo,531200,533279,size but also had the endurance of a
IRm_sSERdYo,533279,535360,donkey but mules aren't the only example
IRm_sSERdYo,535360,537120,of a hybrid animal there are literally
IRm_sSERdYo,537120,539760,hundreds like the liger the pisley bear
IRm_sSERdYo,539760,541680,the wolpin all this is possible because
IRm_sSERdYo,541680,543200,despite the animals being from different
IRm_sSERdYo,543200,545680,species they come from the same genus
IRm_sSERdYo,545680,547279,meaning that their dna is similar enough
IRm_sSERdYo,547279,549360,for their offspring to still be viable
IRm_sSERdYo,549360,551200,that's also sadly why we'll never see a
IRm_sSERdYo,551200,553120,monkey eagle anytime soon as you might
IRm_sSERdYo,553120,554800,expect these hybrids inherit the traits
IRm_sSERdYo,554800,556240,of both parents both in terms of
IRm_sSERdYo,556240,557920,appearance but also in terms of the
IRm_sSERdYo,557920,559279,behaviors that have been coded into
IRm_sSERdYo,559279,561360,their dna for example a hybrid of two
IRm_sSERdYo,561360,563279,migrating birds might develop a third
IRm_sSERdYo,563279,565360,unique migration route that combines the
IRm_sSERdYo,565360,567519,ones of both of its parents this concept
IRm_sSERdYo,567519,568959,of inheriting partial traits from
IRm_sSERdYo,568959,570720,parents of related species would explain
IRm_sSERdYo,570720,572880,why yoshi doesn't fit neatly with either
IRm_sSERdYo,572880,575200,the dragon or the dinosaur category like
IRm_sSERdYo,575200,577200,all hybrids he's adopted abilities from
IRm_sSERdYo,577200,579120,both sides he's taken on the main form
IRm_sSERdYo,579120,581279,of the dragon bahamut but lost the wings
IRm_sSERdYo,581279,582720,thanks to the mixing of the flightless
IRm_sSERdYo,582720,584880,dory and plessy we've actually seen an
IRm_sSERdYo,584880,586560,example of this type of hybrid in the
IRm_sSERdYo,586560,588880,games already loyal theorists i present
IRm_sSERdYo,588880,591360,to you rex a dinosaur-like creature with
IRm_sSERdYo,591360,593200,the dragon wings that looks like a cross
IRm_sSERdYo,593200,595360,between bahamut and plessy so there you
IRm_sSERdYo,595360,596959,have it friends the reason nintendo
IRm_sSERdYo,596959,598240,can't make up their minds about whether
IRm_sSERdYo,598240,600240,yoshi is a dinosaur or a dragon is
IRm_sSERdYo,600240,602079,because he's technically both trust me
IRm_sSERdYo,602079,603839,guys just make the answer canon means
IRm_sSERdYo,603839,605360,that you never have to be wrong again
IRm_sSERdYo,605360,607360,because this time i did not miss a
IRm_sSERdYo,607360,610000,single piece of evidence at all
IRm_sSERdYo,610000,612160,stop nope stop looking at that nope nope
IRm_sSERdYo,612160,614800,turn the camera away stop it
IRm_sSERdYo,614800,617519,yes i know i know there's still the
IRm_sSERdYo,617519,620000,thing on his back is it a shell is it a
IRm_sSERdYo,620000,622160,saddle how does this affect our overall
IRm_sSERdYo,622160,624160,explanation well in the original art
IRm_sSERdYo,624160,626399,from 1993 it labels the thing on yoshi's
IRm_sSERdYo,626399,628480,back a saddle and its flat appearance
IRm_sSERdYo,628480,629760,coupled with the use of it as a place
IRm_sSERdYo,629760,631440,for mario to sit while riding yoshi
IRm_sSERdYo,631440,634000,supports that statement however in more
IRm_sSERdYo,634000,636079,modern appearances that thing on yoshi's
IRm_sSERdYo,636079,638079,back has started to change shapes become
IRm_sSERdYo,638079,640640,raised smaller more rounded the official
IRm_sSERdYo,640640,642560,nintendo japan website currently refers
IRm_sSERdYo,642560,644399,to it as a shell quote even though
IRm_sSERdYo,644399,646640,there's a shell on his back we actually
IRm_sSERdYo,646640,648880,don't know whether yoshi's a dinosaur or
IRm_sSERdYo,648880,652640,a turtle turtle screw you nintendo just
IRm_sSERdYo,652640,654560,throw another reptile in the mix why
IRm_sSERdYo,654560,657120,don't you why not add snake in there too
IRm_sSERdYo,657120,659440,for good measure and annoyingly it's not
IRm_sSERdYo,659440,661279,a translation issue either as the word
IRm_sSERdYo,661279,662959,they use for shell is the same one that
IRm_sSERdYo,662959,664399,they use for the shells that we see
IRm_sSERdYo,664399,666560,during mario kart which opens us up not
IRm_sSERdYo,666560,668720,just to real-life animal comparisons but
IRm_sSERdYo,668720,670640,an in-game one because the shells in
IRm_sSERdYo,670640,672240,mario kart are confirmed to belong to
IRm_sSERdYo,672240,673839,one of the franchise's most notable
IRm_sSERdYo,673839,675680,villains the koopa troopas and that's
IRm_sSERdYo,675680,677600,not where the similarities end either if
IRm_sSERdYo,677600,679600,you compare dry bones as example of a
IRm_sSERdYo,679600,681680,koopa skeleton to the faces of freshly
IRm_sSERdYo,681680,683519,hatched yoshi sores they both have a
IRm_sSERdYo,683519,684959,tooth-like bump in the mouth that seems
IRm_sSERdYo,684959,686880,to disappear as both species eat and
IRm_sSERdYo,686880,689200,grow koopas also have major species
IRm_sSERdYo,689200,691200,variations boom booms hammer brothers
IRm_sSERdYo,691200,693519,lakitu even bowser and the koopalings
IRm_sSERdYo,693519,695360,all of which are visibly distinguishable
IRm_sSERdYo,695360,696800,from each other yoshi would have had
IRm_sSERdYo,696800,698560,plenty of different koopa ancestor
IRm_sSERdYo,698560,700160,options for hybridization maybe the
IRm_sSERdYo,700160,701839,shell of a koopa shrank due to being a
IRm_sSERdYo,701839,703920,hybrid or maybe he started with a koopa
IRm_sSERdYo,703920,705760,like spike whose shell doesn't wrap
IRm_sSERdYo,705760,707680,around his whole torso hybridization
IRm_sSERdYo,707680,709519,with koopas would also explain why
IRm_sSERdYo,709519,711200,despite being related to the dinosaurs
IRm_sSERdYo,711200,713200,and dragons we've discussed yoshi is so
IRm_sSERdYo,713200,715040,much smaller than everyone else and
IRm_sSERdYo,715040,716240,here's the thing you don't even have to
IRm_sSERdYo,716240,718160,take my word for it in the 2010 super
IRm_sSERdYo,718160,720560,mario history book takashi tezuka states
IRm_sSERdYo,720560,722320,that quote yoshi was originally supposed
IRm_sSERdYo,722320,724480,to be a type of koopa that saddle you
IRm_sSERdYo,724480,726720,see on his back was actually his shell
IRm_sSERdYo,726720,728959,turns out tezuka has been team turtle
IRm_sSERdYo,728959,731040,from the start but honestly it all makes
IRm_sSERdYo,731040,733040,sense i don't really know how i couldn't
IRm_sSERdYo,733040,734800,put this one together sooner i literally
IRm_sSERdYo,734800,736480,gave myself the biggest clue possible in
IRm_sSERdYo,736480,738560,the previous episode nintendo's official
IRm_sSERdYo,738560,740240,name for the yoshi dinosaur his
IRm_sSERdYo,740240,743040,scientific name is t yoshisaur
IRm_sSERdYo,743040,745040,munchakoopas and that is coming from the
IRm_sSERdYo,745040,747839,official 1993 nintendo character guide
IRm_sSERdYo,747839,750079,by the way they literally put koopa in
IRm_sSERdYo,750079,752079,yoshi's name should have been obvious no
IRm_sSERdYo,752079,753760,matter how you slice it though all of it
IRm_sSERdYo,753760,755760,is putting one of mario's closest allies
IRm_sSERdYo,755760,757600,into a bit of a compromising position
IRm_sSERdYo,757600,759040,the interviews about the shell being a
IRm_sSERdYo,759040,761360,shell and not a saddle are quite recent
IRm_sSERdYo,761360,763360,the design clearly changed towards shell
IRm_sSERdYo,763360,764720,later on and with more and more
IRm_sSERdYo,764720,765920,interviews bringing up the koopa
IRm_sSERdYo,765920,767839,connection specifically is nintendo
IRm_sSERdYo,767839,769600,trying to tell us something bowser may
IRm_sSERdYo,769600,771040,have almost caused the extinction of the
IRm_sSERdYo,771040,773120,yoshis back in yoshi's island but mario
IRm_sSERdYo,773120,774560,hasn't always been the best of friends
IRm_sSERdYo,774560,776560,to yoshi's either how long until yoshi
IRm_sSERdYo,776560,778560,has had enough how long until those evil
IRm_sSERdYo,778560,780480,bahamut and koopa roots come up to the
IRm_sSERdYo,780480,782639,surface maybe one day we'll drop yoshi
IRm_sSERdYo,782639,784480,into a pit for that little extra jump
IRm_sSERdYo,784480,786399,that'll be the final straw he'll betray
IRm_sSERdYo,786399,788560,us as we've done to him so many times
IRm_sSERdYo,788560,791200,before finally taking his rightful place
IRm_sSERdYo,791200,795040,at bowser's side but hey that's just a
IRm_sSERdYo,795040,798880,theory a game theory thanks for watching
IRm_sSERdYo,798880,800720,seriously though a yoshi turned evil
IRm_sSERdYo,800720,802000,storyline to something i would
IRm_sSERdYo,802000,806839,absolutely eat up make it happen
