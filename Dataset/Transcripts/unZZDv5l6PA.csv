unZZDv5l6PA,880,2240,do you see that do you see that on
unZZDv5l6PA,2240,4080,screen hi i'm patrick holland i've been
unZZDv5l6PA,4080,6240,reviewing phones for six years at cnet
unZZDv5l6PA,6240,8320,and today i'm going to take a look at
unZZDv5l6PA,8320,10400,some popular amazon phone accessories
unZZDv5l6PA,10400,12080,now i don't know what these accessories
unZZDv5l6PA,12080,14080,are i'm taking a look at them figuring
unZZDv5l6PA,14080,15679,out what they are and determining
unZZDv5l6PA,15679,19199,whether i like them or not
unZZDv5l6PA,19199,22640,very excited see we're going to get here
unZZDv5l6PA,23519,25119,all right what do we got here
unZZDv5l6PA,25119,27519,it's called tltd
unZZDv5l6PA,27519,29359,hold your phone more comfortably and
unZZDv5l6PA,29359,32398,securely okay it's like having a pillow
unZZDv5l6PA,32398,34000,for your pinky
unZZDv5l6PA,34000,36399,often times in life i've wanted a pillow
unZZDv5l6PA,36399,38160,for my pinky so let's open this thing up
unZZDv5l6PA,38160,39200,here
unZZDv5l6PA,39200,40239,i feel like
unZZDv5l6PA,40239,42719,oh there we go
unZZDv5l6PA,42719,45440,okay so this is it and um i'm just gonna
unZZDv5l6PA,45440,47440,say that the shape of the pinky part
unZZDv5l6PA,47440,48800,looks
unZZDv5l6PA,48800,51280,suggestive to me it looks like a butt
unZZDv5l6PA,51280,54640,this looks like a butt
unZZDv5l6PA,54640,56879,but let's try it all right i'm gonna
unZZDv5l6PA,56879,59920,peel this off yeah so i'm gonna put this
unZZDv5l6PA,59920,62160,on here oh okay
unZZDv5l6PA,62160,65840,i gotta say this is kind of comfortable
unZZDv5l6PA,65840,67680,there's a little locking mechanism so i
unZZDv5l6PA,67680,68400,can
unZZDv5l6PA,68400,69760,lock it up
unZZDv5l6PA,69760,71520,or i can lock it
unZZDv5l6PA,71520,73600,down if i'm in a meeting
unZZDv5l6PA,73600,76960,i can annoy people by doing this
unZZDv5l6PA,77119,79360,i don't know i think it's practical if
unZZDv5l6PA,79360,81119,you don't put your phone in a pocket
unZZDv5l6PA,81119,81840,because
unZZDv5l6PA,81840,84560,this thing sticks out more than the pop
unZZDv5l6PA,84560,86240,thingy or the lock ringy thingy because
unZZDv5l6PA,86240,89119,at least those things fold down you know
unZZDv5l6PA,89119,91360,whereas this i'm gonna always have this
unZZDv5l6PA,91360,93200,bulge on the back
unZZDv5l6PA,93200,95680,yeah so would i recommend this
unZZDv5l6PA,95680,97040,if you never put your phone in your
unZZDv5l6PA,97040,99680,pocket yes
unZZDv5l6PA,99680,103119,number two number two
unZZDv5l6PA,103119,105520,oh okay so this is called screen
unZZDv5l6PA,105520,106720,cleaning mist
unZZDv5l6PA,106720,108240,i'm gonna guess
unZZDv5l6PA,108240,110159,that this is mist
unZZDv5l6PA,110159,112079,that cleans your phone screen that's my
unZZDv5l6PA,112079,114240,that's my guess on the box it says
unZZDv5l6PA,114240,117439,there's a spray and cloth in one so
unZZDv5l6PA,117439,118560,if you're tired of carrying out a
unZZDv5l6PA,118560,119920,separate spray
unZZDv5l6PA,119920,121920,and a separate cloth
unZZDv5l6PA,121920,124159,this puts them all in one and it says no
unZZDv5l6PA,124159,126079,aggressive chemicals aggressive
unZZDv5l6PA,126079,128479,chemicals that is a punk band i used to
unZZDv5l6PA,128479,130800,be in in the late 90s all right here we
unZZDv5l6PA,130800,131920,go
unZZDv5l6PA,131920,133760,oh okay
unZZDv5l6PA,133760,135440,it kind of looks
unZZDv5l6PA,135440,136879,like
unZZDv5l6PA,136879,139120,mace but it has like a little chamois on
unZZDv5l6PA,139120,142200,the outside
unZZDv5l6PA,143120,145440,the craftsmanship of attaching the
unZZDv5l6PA,145440,148000,chamois or the little wiping cloth
unZZDv5l6PA,148000,150239,not so great you can see it's uneven at
unZZDv5l6PA,150239,152400,the top and bottom whoever applied this
unZZDv5l6PA,152400,153760,did not
unZZDv5l6PA,153760,155280,make sure that they were even or didn't
unZZDv5l6PA,155280,158319,trim the bottom to match the top so
unZZDv5l6PA,158319,161200,i'm not too impressed off the bat i have
unZZDv5l6PA,161200,162800,a couple phones here let me let me try
unZZDv5l6PA,162800,164800,it out see there's a little before and
unZZDv5l6PA,164800,167840,after okay now i'm gonna spray it
unZZDv5l6PA,167840,169519,all right and i'm gonna now wipe it with
unZZDv5l6PA,169519,170720,my
unZZDv5l6PA,170720,172879,um
unZZDv5l6PA,172879,175680,it works pretty well
unZZDv5l6PA,175680,178000,um
unZZDv5l6PA,178000,181360,all right here's the after
unZZDv5l6PA,181360,183840,it works the longevity of this product
unZZDv5l6PA,183840,184959,is where
unZZDv5l6PA,184959,187120,i would be curious you could probably
unZZDv5l6PA,187120,189280,see on the side that it's already
unZZDv5l6PA,189280,191360,saturated so i don't know what happens
unZZDv5l6PA,191360,193360,when the gunk and grease and oils
unZZDv5l6PA,193360,194879,saturate this little cloth on the
unZZDv5l6PA,194879,196840,outside do i have to buy a whole nother
unZZDv5l6PA,196840,200560,one okay would i use this
unZZDv5l6PA,200560,202080,i would not use this this would be
unZZDv5l6PA,202080,203760,something if i was like at a trade show
unZZDv5l6PA,203760,205200,and i got like a tote bag and i got in
unZZDv5l6PA,205200,206640,i'm like oh yeah this is pretty cool i
unZZDv5l6PA,206640,208080,think i probably used the misting part
unZZDv5l6PA,208080,209680,and then end up using a separate cloth
unZZDv5l6PA,209680,213640,once this cloth got dirty
unZZDv5l6PA,214319,216480,this product is very small
unZZDv5l6PA,216480,220000,it's called fingertip video controller
unZZDv5l6PA,220000,222000,all right so this is how you charge it i
unZZDv5l6PA,222000,222879,guess
unZZDv5l6PA,222879,226280,let's see
unZZDv5l6PA,226879,229599,it's blinking
unZZDv5l6PA,229599,232400,oh hi oh this this is my fingertip video
unZZDv5l6PA,232400,234640,controller you don't have one
unZZDv5l6PA,234640,236000,so i'm going to try to pair it to the
unZZDv5l6PA,236000,237360,iphone first and we'll try the pixel
unZZDv5l6PA,237360,239200,second here all right it's paired the
unZZDv5l6PA,239200,241680,light here went solid should probably go
unZZDv5l6PA,241680,244720,on the inside of my finger
unZZDv5l6PA,244720,246959,oh
unZZDv5l6PA,248560,250799,we're recording the screen to my phone
unZZDv5l6PA,250799,252879,and this actually stops and starts the
unZZDv5l6PA,252879,255120,screen recording so i'm going to cancel
unZZDv5l6PA,255120,256799,the screen recording for a second here
unZZDv5l6PA,256799,258959,i'm going to switch hands here i'm going
unZZDv5l6PA,258959,261600,to adjust so we could see what i'm doing
unZZDv5l6PA,261600,265079,on my phone
unZZDv5l6PA,268639,269840,it's not working and i don't know if
unZZDv5l6PA,269840,270880,it's because we were screen recording
unZZDv5l6PA,270880,272320,before i'm going to pair this with a
unZZDv5l6PA,272320,274240,different phone and we'll try the pixel
unZZDv5l6PA,274240,275040,here
unZZDv5l6PA,275040,276400,now according to the box it only works
unZZDv5l6PA,276400,279360,with iphone ipad and tablets okay here
unZZDv5l6PA,279360,281199,we go so we're connecting look at this
unZZDv5l6PA,281199,282560,thing look at this
unZZDv5l6PA,282560,285199,it's it shows like a little keyboard on
unZZDv5l6PA,285199,288800,my screen and the icon is the same as
unZZDv5l6PA,288800,291680,the finger tip video controller all
unZZDv5l6PA,291680,293280,right we're on youtube i'm gonna go
unZZDv5l6PA,293280,295840,probably cnet again okay so the video is
unZZDv5l6PA,295840,298080,playing but this controls
unZZDv5l6PA,298080,300160,scrolling
unZZDv5l6PA,300160,302479,ah so i'm scrolling all the uh other
unZZDv5l6PA,302479,305280,suggested videos under the video here
unZZDv5l6PA,305280,307919,that's kind of cool it's working
unZZDv5l6PA,307919,308840,is it
unZZDv5l6PA,308840,312960,though what happens if i do this
unZZDv5l6PA,313039,314560,okay do you see that
unZZDv5l6PA,314560,317520,do you see that on screen
unZZDv5l6PA,317600,319039,so when i tap it
unZZDv5l6PA,319039,321680,you see a indication of a cursor swiping
unZZDv5l6PA,321680,324639,so it's swiping left pinning where
unZZDv5l6PA,324639,326880,buttons are located you could tap them
unZZDv5l6PA,326880,329199,as long as they are in the exact center
unZZDv5l6PA,329199,330560,of the screen so basically what we've
unZZDv5l6PA,330560,333120,learned here is this thing works but
unZZDv5l6PA,333120,334960,really what it's doing is it's just
unZZDv5l6PA,334960,336720,tapping what's ever in the middle of
unZZDv5l6PA,336720,339039,whatever screen of whatever apparent so
unZZDv5l6PA,339039,341120,i'm going to guess on this moment here
unZZDv5l6PA,341120,342639,if i do it it's going to open up keep
unZZDv5l6PA,342639,344080,notes because that's in the middle of
unZZDv5l6PA,344080,345680,the screen
unZZDv5l6PA,345680,347199,and it open up keep notes okay we
unZZDv5l6PA,347199,348880,figured out how to use this thing now so
unZZDv5l6PA,348880,350800,let's watch some tick tocks so i'm too
unZZDv5l6PA,350800,352960,lazy to use my thumb to scroll so i'm
unZZDv5l6PA,352960,355440,gonna use this device to do that we're
unZZDv5l6PA,355440,357199,back to that same cat video i'm not
unZZDv5l6PA,357199,358639,enjoying this video i'm gonna
unZZDv5l6PA,358639,360240,click once
unZZDv5l6PA,360240,364039,dog translator video
unZZDv5l6PA,365280,369919,[Music]
unZZDv5l6PA,369919,372000,someone sure likes it clearly works uh
unZZDv5l6PA,372000,374880,so let's say like this video i like i
unZZDv5l6PA,374880,376960,can double tap to like it someone sure
unZZDv5l6PA,376960,379680,likes his greek yogurt it worked it
unZZDv5l6PA,379680,381360,worked let's talk about this why would i
unZZDv5l6PA,381360,383199,not use this product
unZZDv5l6PA,383199,384479,it's just
unZZDv5l6PA,384479,386240,doing the things i could just do with my
unZZDv5l6PA,386240,387759,hand on the phone wait wait wait wait
unZZDv5l6PA,387759,389039,come back come back come back i did
unZZDv5l6PA,389039,391039,think of one use for this if i'm an
unZZDv5l6PA,391039,393280,older brother i could pair this to my
unZZDv5l6PA,393280,394639,younger brother's phone without him
unZZDv5l6PA,394639,396960,knowing it and then take control of his
unZZDv5l6PA,396960,399600,phone and upset him that's where this
unZZDv5l6PA,399600,401520,would be completely worth ten dollars to
unZZDv5l6PA,401520,404170,me upsetting my younger brother
unZZDv5l6PA,404170,408420,[Music]
unZZDv5l6PA,408960,411520,oh i thank you good sir this is called

unZZDv5l6PA,443599,446599,laptop

unZZDv5l6PA,470319,472319,video yeah i like this product quite a
unZZDv5l6PA,472319,473759,bit i think the product itself is
unZZDv5l6PA,473759,475360,actually really well made it feels like
unZZDv5l6PA,475360,477039,it's made of aluminum or metal i'm
unZZDv5l6PA,477039,479280,wondering though so i'm going to take my
unZZDv5l6PA,479280,481599,iphone off here all right so this is not
unZZDv5l6PA,481599,483199,designed to go with this but here is a
unZZDv5l6PA,483199,486160,pixel 6 pro so put that on there
unZZDv5l6PA,486160,488080,and open up tick tock
unZZDv5l6PA,488080,490160,i'm going to use the fingertip video

unZZDv5l6PA,503520,505120,you know what
unZZDv5l6PA,505120,507840,this is the setup uh i would say out of
unZZDv5l6PA,507840,510080,everything i've tested so far
unZZDv5l6PA,510080,513440,this is my favorite 16 bucks 16 bucks i
unZZDv5l6PA,513440,515039,would get this i think this is a really
unZZDv5l6PA,515039,516940,good product
unZZDv5l6PA,516940,519360,[Music]
unZZDv5l6PA,519360,521760,oh okay this looks interesting so this
unZZDv5l6PA,521760,525360,is called the uh smart timer phone lock
unZZDv5l6PA,525360,526880,let's see what happens here so i'm gonna
unZZDv5l6PA,526880,529519,open this up on the inside it says lock
unZZDv5l6PA,529519,533040,my phone period lock my dream
unZZDv5l6PA,533040,535120,instead of all the products so far this
unZZDv5l6PA,535120,536800,is not only the most practical but the
unZZDv5l6PA,536800,538959,most philosophical as well i got the
unZZDv5l6PA,538959,541680,phone i put the phone in the box
unZZDv5l6PA,541680,544720,i'm gonna lock up my dream
unZZDv5l6PA,544800,546720,close this here number two i'm gonna
unZZDv5l6PA,546720,548720,turn on the box by clicking the lock
unZZDv5l6PA,548720,551519,button one click
unZZDv5l6PA,551519,553040,i got two minutes set and i'm gonna
unZZDv5l6PA,553040,554399,double tap this
unZZDv5l6PA,554399,556800,double click it and now it should be
unZZDv5l6PA,556800,558640,locked and it gives me a 10 second
unZZDv5l6PA,558640,560399,countdown so now the box is
unZZDv5l6PA,560399,562080,automatically locked all right let's see
unZZDv5l6PA,562080,563279,if i can open this thing up while it's
unZZDv5l6PA,563279,565600,locked
unZZDv5l6PA,566399,567920,i mean if i really wanted to i feel like
unZZDv5l6PA,567920,569440,i could break it open
unZZDv5l6PA,569440,572080,um but
unZZDv5l6PA,572080,573920,my phone
unZZDv5l6PA,573920,576240,i guess i'll have to wait two minutes as
unZZDv5l6PA,576240,577680,a locker how does it work i think it
unZZDv5l6PA,577680,580480,works pretty well the bigger overarching
unZZDv5l6PA,580480,584320,question is why why does this exist my
unZZDv5l6PA,584320,587200,thinking is if maybe you have kids and
unZZDv5l6PA,587200,589040,you want to limit your kids time with
unZZDv5l6PA,589040,590880,their phone you can put it in here lock
unZZDv5l6PA,590880,593839,it up yeah i mean it it feels good i
unZZDv5l6PA,593839,595839,don't understand the cutouts you can
unZZDv5l6PA,595839,597800,find charger phone
unZZDv5l6PA,597800,599040,[Music]
unZZDv5l6PA,599040,600480,i think that's why i could have the
unZZDv5l6PA,600480,602160,phone being charged
unZZDv5l6PA,602160,604320,while i was in here through one of these
unZZDv5l6PA,604320,605360,holes
unZZDv5l6PA,605360,608240,tap to unlock it
unZZDv5l6PA,609120,611760,it says
unZZDv5l6PA,613519,615920,those weren't minutes we typed in
unZZDv5l6PA,615920,618720,those were hours so there's an hour and
unZZDv5l6PA,618720,622240,54 minutes left of this well luckily for
unZZDv5l6PA,622240,625279,us there is an emergency unlock scenario
unZZDv5l6PA,625279,626320,and i'm going to tell it to you right
unZZDv5l6PA,626320,628640,now but i feel by telling it to you it's
unZZDv5l6PA,628640,630560,kind of going to destroy the usefulness
unZZDv5l6PA,630560,632480,of this product so if you're a child and
unZZDv5l6PA,632480,634560,your mom locked up your phone and you
unZZDv5l6PA,634560,636880,want to unlock it just do this hit the
unZZDv5l6PA,636880,639440,up arrow on the left side 10 times in a
unZZDv5l6PA,639440,642320,row to unlock it
unZZDv5l6PA,643040,644320,thanks mom
unZZDv5l6PA,644320,645600,i'm sure i won't use my phone for the
unZZDv5l6PA,645600,646880,next two hours
unZZDv5l6PA,646880,649360,tick tock i feel by showing off this
unZZDv5l6PA,649360,651360,product i might be doing it a disservice
unZZDv5l6PA,651360,653440,because if i didn't show people that
unZZDv5l6PA,653440,655360,emergency unlock part of it then this
unZZDv5l6PA,655360,659240,thing is worth it i think
unZZDv5l6PA,660399,661600,here's the last product let's take a
unZZDv5l6PA,661600,663759,look
unZZDv5l6PA,664240,667440,that was a fantastic handoff oh
unZZDv5l6PA,667440,669440,clearly this is a charging pack of some
unZZDv5l6PA,669440,672720,kind it says my port power bank
unZZDv5l6PA,672720,675360,and it's a detachable wireless charging
unZZDv5l6PA,675360,677839,stand it's key certified so that means
unZZDv5l6PA,677839,680160,it's going to work with your iphone
unZZDv5l6PA,680160,682480,and android phone or really any phone
unZZDv5l6PA,682480,684880,that has two wireless charging it has a
unZZDv5l6PA,684880,688160,10 000 milliamp hour battery in theory
unZZDv5l6PA,688160,690079,this could be something that you charge
unZZDv5l6PA,690079,691680,like once a week or once every couple
unZZDv5l6PA,691680,693600,weeks if you're using it frequently
unZZDv5l6PA,693600,696399,let's open it up
unZZDv5l6PA,696959,698480,i don't know about this color color
unZZDv5l6PA,698480,700720,looks like a cadillac from the late 80s
unZZDv5l6PA,700720,702399,like a khaki
unZZDv5l6PA,702399,704240,metallic khaki color
unZZDv5l6PA,704240,706959,it's described on the box as
unZZDv5l6PA,706959,709680,a warm silver let's get this thing going
unZZDv5l6PA,709680,711279,here i have a basically a power bank
unZZDv5l6PA,711279,713839,which is nice so on the bottom i have a
unZZDv5l6PA,713839,717680,usba a usb-c cable if i want to use the
unZZDv5l6PA,717680,721440,dock i'm going to slide this in like so
unZZDv5l6PA,721440,724160,and now i have a dock
unZZDv5l6PA,724160,725440,all right we're going to charge this up
unZZDv5l6PA,725440,726480,a little bit
unZZDv5l6PA,726480,728639,okay so this is a wireless charger but
unZZDv5l6PA,728639,730560,let's see if it works when it's plugged
unZZDv5l6PA,730560,733360,in i put the iphone on here
unZZDv5l6PA,733360,735920,and it's charging let's try the pixel 6
unZZDv5l6PA,735920,737920,pro
unZZDv5l6PA,737920,739600,it's still charging it's pretty cool and
unZZDv5l6PA,739600,742160,then in theory let's say that i need to
unZZDv5l6PA,742160,744399,go and continue to charge my phone i
unZZDv5l6PA,744399,746000,should be able to take this out and it's
unZZDv5l6PA,746000,748240,still charging honestly what i like
unZZDv5l6PA,748240,750079,about this is a lot there's a lot of
unZZDv5l6PA,750079,752480,likes about this i like that this can
unZZDv5l6PA,752480,754639,just be a portable power bank i like
unZZDv5l6PA,754639,756800,that i could charge the power bank part
unZZDv5l6PA,756800,759040,of it on the dock as well feels pretty
unZZDv5l6PA,759040,760800,cool i'm not too crazy about the color
unZZDv5l6PA,760800,762880,but apparently comes in black and it's a
unZZDv5l6PA,762880,764880,very big power bank so you could do like
unZZDv5l6PA,764880,766880,an ipad and a tablet pretty easily do
unZZDv5l6PA,766880,770160,you know the price for this thing 58
unZZDv5l6PA,770160,772560,i think if i got this in black for 58 i
unZZDv5l6PA,772560,774320,would be very happy i just found out
unZZDv5l6PA,774320,776800,that the black version is 52 i would
unZZDv5l6PA,776800,778610,definitely get this

unZZDv5l6PA,822540,829519,[Music]
unZZDv5l6PA,829519,831600,you

unZZDv5l6PA,880,2240,do you see that do you see that on
unZZDv5l6PA,2240,4080,screen hi i'm patrick holland i've been
unZZDv5l6PA,4080,6240,reviewing phones for six years at cnet
unZZDv5l6PA,6240,8320,and today i'm going to take a look at
unZZDv5l6PA,8320,10400,some popular amazon phone accessories
unZZDv5l6PA,10400,12080,now i don't know what these accessories
unZZDv5l6PA,12080,14080,are i'm taking a look at them figuring
unZZDv5l6PA,14080,15679,out what they are and determining
unZZDv5l6PA,15679,19199,whether i like them or not
unZZDv5l6PA,19199,22640,very excited see we're going to get here
unZZDv5l6PA,23519,25119,all right what do we got here
unZZDv5l6PA,25119,27519,it's called tltd
unZZDv5l6PA,27519,29359,hold your phone more comfortably and
unZZDv5l6PA,29359,32398,securely okay it's like having a pillow
unZZDv5l6PA,32398,34000,for your pinky
unZZDv5l6PA,34000,36399,often times in life i've wanted a pillow
unZZDv5l6PA,36399,38160,for my pinky so let's open this thing up
unZZDv5l6PA,38160,39200,here
unZZDv5l6PA,39200,40239,i feel like
unZZDv5l6PA,40239,42719,oh there we go
unZZDv5l6PA,42719,45440,okay so this is it and um i'm just gonna
unZZDv5l6PA,45440,47440,say that the shape of the pinky part
unZZDv5l6PA,47440,48800,looks
unZZDv5l6PA,48800,51280,suggestive to me it looks like a butt
unZZDv5l6PA,51280,54640,this looks like a butt
unZZDv5l6PA,54640,56879,but let's try it all right i'm gonna
unZZDv5l6PA,56879,59920,peel this off yeah so i'm gonna put this
unZZDv5l6PA,59920,62160,on here oh okay
unZZDv5l6PA,62160,65840,i gotta say this is kind of comfortable
unZZDv5l6PA,65840,67680,there's a little locking mechanism so i
unZZDv5l6PA,67680,68400,can
unZZDv5l6PA,68400,69760,lock it up
unZZDv5l6PA,69760,71520,or i can lock it
unZZDv5l6PA,71520,73600,down if i'm in a meeting
unZZDv5l6PA,73600,76960,i can annoy people by doing this
unZZDv5l6PA,77119,79360,i don't know i think it's practical if
unZZDv5l6PA,79360,81119,you don't put your phone in a pocket
unZZDv5l6PA,81119,81840,because
unZZDv5l6PA,81840,84560,this thing sticks out more than the pop
unZZDv5l6PA,84560,86240,thingy or the lock ringy thingy because
unZZDv5l6PA,86240,89119,at least those things fold down you know
unZZDv5l6PA,89119,91360,whereas this i'm gonna always have this
unZZDv5l6PA,91360,93200,bulge on the back
unZZDv5l6PA,93200,95680,yeah so would i recommend this
unZZDv5l6PA,95680,97040,if you never put your phone in your
unZZDv5l6PA,97040,99680,pocket yes
unZZDv5l6PA,99680,103119,number two number two
unZZDv5l6PA,103119,105520,oh okay so this is called screen
unZZDv5l6PA,105520,106720,cleaning mist
unZZDv5l6PA,106720,108240,i'm gonna guess
unZZDv5l6PA,108240,110159,that this is mist
unZZDv5l6PA,110159,112079,that cleans your phone screen that's my
unZZDv5l6PA,112079,114240,that's my guess on the box it says
unZZDv5l6PA,114240,117439,there's a spray and cloth in one so
unZZDv5l6PA,117439,118560,if you're tired of carrying out a
unZZDv5l6PA,118560,119920,separate spray
unZZDv5l6PA,119920,121920,and a separate cloth
unZZDv5l6PA,121920,124159,this puts them all in one and it says no
unZZDv5l6PA,124159,126079,aggressive chemicals aggressive
unZZDv5l6PA,126079,128479,chemicals that is a punk band i used to
unZZDv5l6PA,128479,130800,be in in the late 90s all right here we
unZZDv5l6PA,130800,131920,go
unZZDv5l6PA,131920,133760,oh okay
unZZDv5l6PA,133760,135440,it kind of looks
unZZDv5l6PA,135440,136879,like
unZZDv5l6PA,136879,139120,mace but it has like a little chamois on
unZZDv5l6PA,139120,142200,the outside
unZZDv5l6PA,143120,145440,the craftsmanship of attaching the
unZZDv5l6PA,145440,148000,chamois or the little wiping cloth
unZZDv5l6PA,148000,150239,not so great you can see it's uneven at
unZZDv5l6PA,150239,152400,the top and bottom whoever applied this
unZZDv5l6PA,152400,153760,did not
unZZDv5l6PA,153760,155280,make sure that they were even or didn't
unZZDv5l6PA,155280,158319,trim the bottom to match the top so
unZZDv5l6PA,158319,161200,i'm not too impressed off the bat i have
unZZDv5l6PA,161200,162800,a couple phones here let me let me try
unZZDv5l6PA,162800,164800,it out see there's a little before and
unZZDv5l6PA,164800,167840,after okay now i'm gonna spray it
unZZDv5l6PA,167840,169519,all right and i'm gonna now wipe it with
unZZDv5l6PA,169519,170720,my
unZZDv5l6PA,170720,172879,um
unZZDv5l6PA,172879,175680,it works pretty well
unZZDv5l6PA,175680,178000,um
unZZDv5l6PA,178000,181360,all right here's the after
unZZDv5l6PA,181360,183840,it works the longevity of this product
unZZDv5l6PA,183840,184959,is where
unZZDv5l6PA,184959,187120,i would be curious you could probably
unZZDv5l6PA,187120,189280,see on the side that it's already
unZZDv5l6PA,189280,191360,saturated so i don't know what happens
unZZDv5l6PA,191360,193360,when the gunk and grease and oils
unZZDv5l6PA,193360,194879,saturate this little cloth on the
unZZDv5l6PA,194879,196840,outside do i have to buy a whole nother
unZZDv5l6PA,196840,200560,one okay would i use this
unZZDv5l6PA,200560,202080,i would not use this this would be
unZZDv5l6PA,202080,203760,something if i was like at a trade show
unZZDv5l6PA,203760,205200,and i got like a tote bag and i got in
unZZDv5l6PA,205200,206640,i'm like oh yeah this is pretty cool i
unZZDv5l6PA,206640,208080,think i probably used the misting part
unZZDv5l6PA,208080,209680,and then end up using a separate cloth
unZZDv5l6PA,209680,213640,once this cloth got dirty
unZZDv5l6PA,214319,216480,this product is very small
unZZDv5l6PA,216480,220000,it's called fingertip video controller
unZZDv5l6PA,220000,222000,all right so this is how you charge it i
unZZDv5l6PA,222000,222879,guess
unZZDv5l6PA,222879,226280,let's see
unZZDv5l6PA,226879,229599,it's blinking
unZZDv5l6PA,229599,232400,oh hi oh this this is my fingertip video
unZZDv5l6PA,232400,234640,controller you don't have one
unZZDv5l6PA,234640,236000,so i'm going to try to pair it to the
unZZDv5l6PA,236000,237360,iphone first and we'll try the pixel
unZZDv5l6PA,237360,239200,second here all right it's paired the
unZZDv5l6PA,239200,241680,light here went solid should probably go
unZZDv5l6PA,241680,244720,on the inside of my finger
unZZDv5l6PA,244720,246959,oh
unZZDv5l6PA,248560,250799,we're recording the screen to my phone
unZZDv5l6PA,250799,252879,and this actually stops and starts the
unZZDv5l6PA,252879,255120,screen recording so i'm going to cancel
unZZDv5l6PA,255120,256799,the screen recording for a second here
unZZDv5l6PA,256799,258959,i'm going to switch hands here i'm going
unZZDv5l6PA,258959,261600,to adjust so we could see what i'm doing
unZZDv5l6PA,261600,265079,on my phone
unZZDv5l6PA,268639,269840,it's not working and i don't know if
unZZDv5l6PA,269840,270880,it's because we were screen recording
unZZDv5l6PA,270880,272320,before i'm going to pair this with a
unZZDv5l6PA,272320,274240,different phone and we'll try the pixel
unZZDv5l6PA,274240,275040,here
unZZDv5l6PA,275040,276400,now according to the box it only works
unZZDv5l6PA,276400,279360,with iphone ipad and tablets okay here
unZZDv5l6PA,279360,281199,we go so we're connecting look at this
unZZDv5l6PA,281199,282560,thing look at this
unZZDv5l6PA,282560,285199,it's it shows like a little keyboard on
unZZDv5l6PA,285199,288800,my screen and the icon is the same as
unZZDv5l6PA,288800,291680,the finger tip video controller all
unZZDv5l6PA,291680,293280,right we're on youtube i'm gonna go
unZZDv5l6PA,293280,295840,probably cnet again okay so the video is
unZZDv5l6PA,295840,298080,playing but this controls
unZZDv5l6PA,298080,300160,scrolling
unZZDv5l6PA,300160,302479,ah so i'm scrolling all the uh other
unZZDv5l6PA,302479,305280,suggested videos under the video here
unZZDv5l6PA,305280,307919,that's kind of cool it's working
unZZDv5l6PA,307919,308840,is it
unZZDv5l6PA,308840,312960,though what happens if i do this
unZZDv5l6PA,313039,314560,okay do you see that
unZZDv5l6PA,314560,317520,do you see that on screen
unZZDv5l6PA,317600,319039,so when i tap it
unZZDv5l6PA,319039,321680,you see a indication of a cursor swiping
unZZDv5l6PA,321680,324639,so it's swiping left pinning where
unZZDv5l6PA,324639,326880,buttons are located you could tap them
unZZDv5l6PA,326880,329199,as long as they are in the exact center
unZZDv5l6PA,329199,330560,of the screen so basically what we've
unZZDv5l6PA,330560,333120,learned here is this thing works but
unZZDv5l6PA,333120,334960,really what it's doing is it's just

unZZDv5l6PA,475360,477039,it's made of aluminum or metal i'm

unZZDv5l6PA,479280,481599,iphone off here all right so this is not
unZZDv5l6PA,481599,483199,designed to go with this but here is a
unZZDv5l6PA,483199,486160,pixel 6 pro so put that on there

unZZDv5l6PA,503520,505120,you know what
unZZDv5l6PA,505120,507840,this is the setup uh i would say out of
unZZDv5l6PA,507840,510080,everything i've tested so far
unZZDv5l6PA,510080,513440,this is my favorite 16 bucks 16 bucks i
unZZDv5l6PA,513440,515039,would get this i think this is a really
unZZDv5l6PA,515039,516940,good product
unZZDv5l6PA,516940,519360,[Music]
unZZDv5l6PA,519360,521760,oh okay this looks interesting so this
unZZDv5l6PA,521760,525360,is called the uh smart timer phone lock
unZZDv5l6PA,525360,526880,let's see what happens here so i'm gonna
unZZDv5l6PA,526880,529519,open this up on the inside it says lock
unZZDv5l6PA,529519,533040,my phone period lock my dream
unZZDv5l6PA,533040,535120,instead of all the products so far this
unZZDv5l6PA,535120,536800,is not only the most practical but the
unZZDv5l6PA,536800,538959,most philosophical as well i got the
unZZDv5l6PA,538959,541680,phone i put the phone in the box
unZZDv5l6PA,541680,544720,i'm gonna lock up my dream
unZZDv5l6PA,544800,546720,close this here number two i'm gonna
unZZDv5l6PA,546720,548720,turn on the box by clicking the lock
unZZDv5l6PA,548720,551519,button one click
unZZDv5l6PA,551519,553040,i got two minutes set and i'm gonna
unZZDv5l6PA,553040,554399,double tap this
unZZDv5l6PA,554399,556800,double click it and now it should be
unZZDv5l6PA,556800,558640,locked and it gives me a 10 second
unZZDv5l6PA,558640,560399,countdown so now the box is
unZZDv5l6PA,560399,562080,automatically locked all right let's see
unZZDv5l6PA,562080,563279,if i can open this thing up while it's
unZZDv5l6PA,563279,565600,locked
unZZDv5l6PA,566399,567920,i mean if i really wanted to i feel like
unZZDv5l6PA,567920,569440,i could break it open
unZZDv5l6PA,569440,572080,um but
unZZDv5l6PA,572080,573920,my phone
unZZDv5l6PA,573920,576240,i guess i'll have to wait two minutes as
unZZDv5l6PA,576240,577680,a locker how does it work i think it
unZZDv5l6PA,577680,580480,works pretty well the bigger overarching
unZZDv5l6PA,580480,584320,question is why why does this exist my
unZZDv5l6PA,584320,587200,thinking is if maybe you have kids and
unZZDv5l6PA,587200,589040,you want to limit your kids time with
unZZDv5l6PA,589040,590880,their phone you can put it in here lock
unZZDv5l6PA,590880,593839,it up yeah i mean it it feels good i
unZZDv5l6PA,593839,595839,don't understand the cutouts you can
unZZDv5l6PA,595839,597800,find charger phone
unZZDv5l6PA,597800,599040,[Music]
unZZDv5l6PA,599040,600480,i think that's why i could have the
unZZDv5l6PA,600480,602160,phone being charged
unZZDv5l6PA,602160,604320,while i was in here through one of these
unZZDv5l6PA,604320,605360,holes
unZZDv5l6PA,605360,608240,tap to unlock it
unZZDv5l6PA,609120,611760,it says
unZZDv5l6PA,613519,615920,those weren't minutes we typed in
unZZDv5l6PA,615920,618720,those were hours so there's an hour and
unZZDv5l6PA,618720,622240,54 minutes left of this well luckily for
unZZDv5l6PA,622240,625279,us there is an emergency unlock scenario
unZZDv5l6PA,625279,626320,and i'm going to tell it to you right
unZZDv5l6PA,626320,628640,now but i feel by telling it to you it's
unZZDv5l6PA,628640,630560,kind of going to destroy the usefulness
unZZDv5l6PA,630560,632480,of this product so if you're a child and
unZZDv5l6PA,632480,634560,your mom locked up your phone and you
unZZDv5l6PA,634560,636880,want to unlock it just do this hit the
unZZDv5l6PA,636880,639440,up arrow on the left side 10 times in a
unZZDv5l6PA,639440,642320,row to unlock it
unZZDv5l6PA,643040,644320,thanks mom
unZZDv5l6PA,644320,645600,i'm sure i won't use my phone for the
unZZDv5l6PA,645600,646880,next two hours
unZZDv5l6PA,646880,649360,tick tock i feel by showing off this
unZZDv5l6PA,649360,651360,product i might be doing it a disservice
unZZDv5l6PA,651360,653440,because if i didn't show people that
unZZDv5l6PA,653440,655360,emergency unlock part of it then this
unZZDv5l6PA,655360,659240,thing is worth it i think
unZZDv5l6PA,660399,661600,here's the last product let's take a
unZZDv5l6PA,661600,663759,look
unZZDv5l6PA,664240,667440,that was a fantastic handoff oh
unZZDv5l6PA,667440,669440,clearly this is a charging pack of some
unZZDv5l6PA,669440,672720,kind it says my port power bank
unZZDv5l6PA,672720,675360,and it's a detachable wireless charging
unZZDv5l6PA,675360,677839,stand it's key certified so that means
unZZDv5l6PA,677839,680160,it's going to work with your iphone
unZZDv5l6PA,680160,682480,and android phone or really any phone
unZZDv5l6PA,682480,684880,that has two wireless charging it has a
unZZDv5l6PA,684880,688160,10 000 milliamp hour battery in theory
unZZDv5l6PA,688160,690079,this could be something that you charge
unZZDv5l6PA,690079,691680,like once a week or once every couple
unZZDv5l6PA,691680,693600,weeks if you're using it frequently
unZZDv5l6PA,693600,696399,let's open it up
unZZDv5l6PA,696959,698480,i don't know about this color color
unZZDv5l6PA,698480,700720,looks like a cadillac from the late 80s
unZZDv5l6PA,700720,702399,like a khaki
unZZDv5l6PA,702399,704240,metallic khaki color
unZZDv5l6PA,704240,706959,it's described on the box as
unZZDv5l6PA,706959,709680,a warm silver let's get this thing going
unZZDv5l6PA,709680,711279,here i have a basically a power bank
unZZDv5l6PA,711279,713839,which is nice so on the bottom i have a
unZZDv5l6PA,713839,717680,usba a usb-c cable if i want to use the
unZZDv5l6PA,717680,721440,dock i'm going to slide this in like so
unZZDv5l6PA,721440,724160,and now i have a dock
unZZDv5l6PA,724160,725440,all right we're going to charge this up
unZZDv5l6PA,725440,726480,a little bit
unZZDv5l6PA,726480,728639,okay so this is a wireless charger but
unZZDv5l6PA,728639,730560,let's see if it works when it's plugged
unZZDv5l6PA,730560,733360,in i put the iphone on here
unZZDv5l6PA,733360,735920,and it's charging let's try the pixel 6
unZZDv5l6PA,735920,737920,pro
unZZDv5l6PA,737920,739600,it's still charging it's pretty cool and
unZZDv5l6PA,739600,742160,then in theory let's say that i need to
unZZDv5l6PA,742160,744399,go and continue to charge my phone i
unZZDv5l6PA,744399,746000,should be able to take this out and it's
unZZDv5l6PA,746000,748240,still charging honestly what i like
unZZDv5l6PA,748240,750079,about this is a lot there's a lot of
unZZDv5l6PA,750079,752480,likes about this i like that this can
unZZDv5l6PA,752480,754639,just be a portable power bank i like
unZZDv5l6PA,754639,756800,that i could charge the power bank part
unZZDv5l6PA,756800,759040,of it on the dock as well feels pretty
unZZDv5l6PA,759040,760800,cool i'm not too crazy about the color
unZZDv5l6PA,760800,762880,but apparently comes in black and it's a
unZZDv5l6PA,762880,764880,very big power bank so you could do like
unZZDv5l6PA,764880,766880,an ipad and a tablet pretty easily do
unZZDv5l6PA,766880,770160,you know the price for this thing 58
unZZDv5l6PA,770160,772560,i think if i got this in black for 58 i
unZZDv5l6PA,772560,774320,would be very happy i just found out
unZZDv5l6PA,774320,776800,that the black version is 52 i would
