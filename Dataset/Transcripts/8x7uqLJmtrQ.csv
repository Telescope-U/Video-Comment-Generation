8x7uqLJmtrQ,2560,4640,first we'll need to put the toy together
8x7uqLJmtrQ,4640,7520,we'll start with this cool red track it
8x7uqLJmtrQ,7520,10559,connects the back to the front
8x7uqLJmtrQ,10559,13519,one snap here at the front
8x7uqLJmtrQ,13519,17600,and one more at the back
8x7uqLJmtrQ,17600,20080,and look at this cool crane it'll help
8x7uqLJmtrQ,20080,23359,us raise our vehicles
8x7uqLJmtrQ,25439,27760,we can use this lever to raise the crane
8x7uqLJmtrQ,27760,29760,arm up and down
8x7uqLJmtrQ,29760,32000,let's stick this yellow post on top of
8x7uqLJmtrQ,32000,32669,the red one
8x7uqLJmtrQ,32669,36880,[Music]
8x7uqLJmtrQ,36880,39680,look a helicopter it attaches to the
8x7uqLJmtrQ,39680,42320,yellow post
8x7uqLJmtrQ,42320,44640,if we turn the green dial the helicopter
8x7uqLJmtrQ,44640,45920,flies
8x7uqLJmtrQ,45920,48800,i think that's really cool
8x7uqLJmtrQ,48800,50480,do you know what this is
8x7uqLJmtrQ,50480,54000,it's one part of a bridge
8x7uqLJmtrQ,55440,57600,and here's the other part now we have a
8x7uqLJmtrQ,57600,58879,whole bridge
8x7uqLJmtrQ,58879,61039,we can raise and lower the bridge with
8x7uqLJmtrQ,61039,62800,this yellow lever
8x7uqLJmtrQ,62800,65840,i think our toy needs two trees
8x7uqLJmtrQ,65840,68000,one to go here
8x7uqLJmtrQ,68000,72080,and the other one can sit right here
8x7uqLJmtrQ,72080,74400,great job guys now we just need some
8x7uqLJmtrQ,74400,76799,vehicles maybe we could find some behind
8x7uqLJmtrQ,76799,79759,these garages
8x7uqLJmtrQ,79759,82320,uh-oh the doors are locked good thing we
8x7uqLJmtrQ,82320,84560,have these keys to unlock them
8x7uqLJmtrQ,84560,86880,the red door has a lock shaped like the
8x7uqLJmtrQ,86880,88560,letter l
8x7uqLJmtrQ,88560,91680,the red key also has an l shape maybe it
8x7uqLJmtrQ,91680,94560,unlocks the door
8x7uqLJmtrQ,96720,100320,hey it worked let's see what's inside
8x7uqLJmtrQ,100320,104798,it's a red egg let's crack it open
8x7uqLJmtrQ,105439,107600,hey there's slime inside with little

8x7uqLJmtrQ,115759,118240,you ever seen a fire truck
8x7uqLJmtrQ,118240,120719,cool me too let's play with it on our
8x7uqLJmtrQ,120719,123520,track we'll start by putting it here now
8x7uqLJmtrQ,123520,125200,to get our fire truck started on the
8x7uqLJmtrQ,125200,127439,track we need to raise it up to the next
8x7uqLJmtrQ,127439,130000,level we can do that by pressing the red
8x7uqLJmtrQ,130000,131200,button
8x7uqLJmtrQ,131200,132959,now we'd like our fire truck to follow
8x7uqLJmtrQ,132959,135040,the path to the bottom of the hill we
8x7uqLJmtrQ,135040,137200,can do that by turning this red dial
8x7uqLJmtrQ,137200,138239,back
8x7uqLJmtrQ,138239,140800,and forth
8x7uqLJmtrQ,140840,143760,back and forth
8x7uqLJmtrQ,143760,145520,now we need to help the fire truck up
8x7uqLJmtrQ,145520,148160,the hill to the helicopter to do that we
8x7uqLJmtrQ,148160,150720,need to turn this green dial
8x7uqLJmtrQ,150720,153120,look at that our fire truck is climbing
8x7uqLJmtrQ,153120,157200,up and up and up to the top of the hill
8x7uqLJmtrQ,157200,160239,yay good job fire truck
8x7uqLJmtrQ,160239,162800,uh-oh our helicopter is too high for our
8x7uqLJmtrQ,162800,165120,fire truck to get to we can make it go
8x7uqLJmtrQ,165120,167360,up and down with this yellow button
8x7uqLJmtrQ,167360,169280,but that's not quite high enough we'll
8x7uqLJmtrQ,169280,170920,need to press it hard
8x7uqLJmtrQ,170920,172959,[Music]
8x7uqLJmtrQ,172959,175599,alright that did the trick now let's fly
8x7uqLJmtrQ,175599,177840,the helicopter around to drop the fire
8x7uqLJmtrQ,177840,180159,truck by the bridge do you remember how
8x7uqLJmtrQ,180159,181680,to close the bridge
8x7uqLJmtrQ,181680,184000,you're right the yellow lever closes the
8x7uqLJmtrQ,184000,185840,bridge
8x7uqLJmtrQ,185840,188159,now we need to use the gray lever to use
8x7uqLJmtrQ,188159,190879,the crane to raise the fire truck up
8x7uqLJmtrQ,190879,193360,and down it goes
8x7uqLJmtrQ,193360,195920,fantastic we got our first vehicle down
8x7uqLJmtrQ,195920,197760,the track now let's check out those
8x7uqLJmtrQ,197760,200959,garages for our next vehicle our second
8x7uqLJmtrQ,200959,204000,garage's lock has the letter z
8x7uqLJmtrQ,204000,206159,and wouldn't you know it our white key
8x7uqLJmtrQ,206159,209599,has the letter z as well it matches
8x7uqLJmtrQ,209599,211360,and if we put it in the hole we'll
8x7uqLJmtrQ,211360,212879,unlock the door
8x7uqLJmtrQ,212879,214879,there we go
8x7uqLJmtrQ,214879,216959,now to see what was inside
8x7uqLJmtrQ,216959,219920,look at that it's a glittery egg let's
8x7uqLJmtrQ,219920,222480,crack it open
8x7uqLJmtrQ,222480,224400,this one has slime too
8x7uqLJmtrQ,224400,226480,but this slime is clear because you can
8x7uqLJmtrQ,226480,228799,see through it and i see that there's an
8x7uqLJmtrQ,228799,231760,ambulance inside ambulances are great
8x7uqLJmtrQ,231760,233519,because they take sick people to the
8x7uqLJmtrQ,233519,234720,hospital
8x7uqLJmtrQ,234720,237519,have you ever heard an ambulance's siren
8x7uqLJmtrQ,237519,241280,it sounds like this
8x7uqLJmtrQ,241280,243680,cool huh now let's play with it on the
8x7uqLJmtrQ,243680,245760,track first we'll help it out with the
8x7uqLJmtrQ,245760,248080,red button
8x7uqLJmtrQ,248080,250239,and then lead it to the hill by twisting
8x7uqLJmtrQ,250239,254519,the red dial back and forth
8x7uqLJmtrQ,256720,258400,now let's give our ambulance a helping
8x7uqLJmtrQ,258400,262160,hand up the hill with the green dial
8x7uqLJmtrQ,262160,266400,here it comes up to see the helicopter
8x7uqLJmtrQ,267600,271120,then we can pop it up to the helicopter
8x7uqLJmtrQ,271120,273440,now let's drop it off at the bridge
8x7uqLJmtrQ,273440,276639,pull our yellow lever
8x7uqLJmtrQ,278400,280720,then let's help with the gray lever
8x7uqLJmtrQ,280720,283840,and down it goes to complete its lap
8x7uqLJmtrQ,283840,286160,now we've helped two vehicles around our
8x7uqLJmtrQ,286160,289440,track our last door the blue one has a t
8x7uqLJmtrQ,289440,292080,on its lock i'm sure our trusty keys can
8x7uqLJmtrQ,292080,293440,help us with that
8x7uqLJmtrQ,293440,295440,let's use the blue key because it has a
8x7uqLJmtrQ,295440,300000,t-shape on it and unlock the blue door
8x7uqLJmtrQ,300000,301759,there we go
8x7uqLJmtrQ,301759,304720,now we've unlocked our last door
8x7uqLJmtrQ,304720,308160,and inside is this cool shiny blue egg
8x7uqLJmtrQ,308160,310160,any ideas what vehicle we might find
8x7uqLJmtrQ,310160,311520,inside
8x7uqLJmtrQ,311520,313199,let's find out
8x7uqLJmtrQ,313199,316080,oh wow look at this blue slime
8x7uqLJmtrQ,316080,318400,it has a yellow duck in it that's not
8x7uqLJmtrQ,318400,320280,what we need
8x7uqLJmtrQ,320280,321919,[Music]
8x7uqLJmtrQ,321919,324720,and look over here there's a green frog
8x7uqLJmtrQ,324720,328160,that's not a vehicle either
8x7uqLJmtrQ,329600,332400,ah i think i see there's the vehicle
8x7uqLJmtrQ,332400,335199,we're looking for and it's a police car
8x7uqLJmtrQ,335199,337280,because it has the word police on the
8x7uqLJmtrQ,337280,338560,side
8x7uqLJmtrQ,338560,341759,police cars help keep our roads safe
8x7uqLJmtrQ,341759,344800,now let's play with it on our track
8x7uqLJmtrQ,344800,346960,here you go police car
8x7uqLJmtrQ,346960,349360,we'll send you up with the red button
8x7uqLJmtrQ,349360,350960,then we'll turn the police car to the
8x7uqLJmtrQ,350960,352479,right
8x7uqLJmtrQ,352479,353919,to the left
8x7uqLJmtrQ,353919,356240,and then back to the right again
8x7uqLJmtrQ,356240,358160,now we'll help the police car climb up
8x7uqLJmtrQ,358160,361759,the hill to the helicopter
8x7uqLJmtrQ,364720,367360,that's some nice climbing
8x7uqLJmtrQ,367360,369840,now we can pop it up
8x7uqLJmtrQ,369840,372560,and swing it around to our bridge
8x7uqLJmtrQ,372560,374319,we can lower the bridge to let the
8x7uqLJmtrQ,374319,376639,police guard down the hill and help it
8x7uqLJmtrQ,376639,378319,up with the crane
8x7uqLJmtrQ,378319,380240,and that's how our police car finishes
