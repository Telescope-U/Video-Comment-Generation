ItxIvVH3T6o,80,2159,almost exactly one year ago i tried to
ItxIvVH3T6o,2159,4880,do the impossible eat my own christmas
ItxIvVH3T6o,4880,7200,tree why because i'm a youtuber did i
ItxIvVH3T6o,7200,8480,say more i learned that some trees are
ItxIvVH3T6o,8480,10240,non-toxic and i was all like i can eat
ItxIvVH3T6o,10240,12160,you but there's a big difference between
ItxIvVH3T6o,12160,14240,something being possible in theory and
ItxIvVH3T6o,14240,15920,something being done in reality and as
ItxIvVH3T6o,15920,17279,you might expect when i tried to eat an
ItxIvVH3T6o,17279,20320,entire christmas tree the results were
ItxIvVH3T6o,20320,23359,mixed yep it's true but now i'm back to
ItxIvVH3T6o,23359,26720,try again a year older and a year wiser
ItxIvVH3T6o,26720,28160,though apparently not wise enough to
ItxIvVH3T6o,28160,30240,just scrap the entire idea out right so
ItxIvVH3T6o,30240,33360,again i ask the question can i eat my
ItxIvVH3T6o,33360,35840,entire christmas tree only this time can
ItxIvVH3T6o,35840,38239,i eat it disguised as these better yet
ItxIvVH3T6o,38239,40800,can i trick steph into helping me loyal
ItxIvVH3T6o,40800,42719,theorists break out the sandpaper
ItxIvVH3T6o,42719,45039,because we're sneaking sawdust to santa
ItxIvVH3T6o,45039,46879,claus hopefully it doesn't get us on the
ItxIvVH3T6o,46879,51559,naughty list or sent to the hospital
ItxIvVH3T6o,60890,62879,[Music]
ItxIvVH3T6o,62879,66000,hello internet welcome to food theory
ItxIvVH3T6o,66000,68000,where today it's the season of giving
ItxIvVH3T6o,68000,69600,giving your loved ones holiday cookies
ItxIvVH3T6o,69600,71600,filled with sawdust that is today it's
ItxIvVH3T6o,71600,73439,round two and what has inexplicably
ItxIvVH3T6o,73439,75360,become a yearly challenge eating the
ItxIvVH3T6o,75360,77759,entirety of a christmas tree you see i
ItxIvVH3T6o,77759,79360,hate seeing dead trees left on the curb
ItxIvVH3T6o,79360,80799,at the end of the holiday season not
ItxIvVH3T6o,80799,82240,only is it a depressing way to end the
ItxIvVH3T6o,82240,84479,season lights but it's also just a waste
ItxIvVH3T6o,84479,87200,of trees like you cut it down for what a
ItxIvVH3T6o,87200,89759,month of festive joy it's not enough if
ItxIvVH3T6o,89759,91520,you're sacrificing the tree well then
ItxIvVH3T6o,91520,93439,let's put it to use and since i'm no
ItxIvVH3T6o,93439,95280,ancient egyptian papyrus expert the only
ItxIvVH3T6o,95280,96799,thing i can think of is eating that
ItxIvVH3T6o,96799,98960,thing but as i proved last year eating
ItxIvVH3T6o,98960,100799,each individual part of the tree while
ItxIvVH3T6o,100799,103680,possible is not necessarily pleasant but
ItxIvVH3T6o,103680,105920,what if what if there were a way of
ItxIvVH3T6o,105920,107840,disguising that tree inside of something
ItxIvVH3T6o,107840,110159,else something a bit sweeter something
ItxIvVH3T6o,110159,113119,delicious something festive something
ItxIvVH3T6o,113119,116399,like say a christmas cookie one year ago
ItxIvVH3T6o,116399,119680,almost to the day we had a crazy idea we
ItxIvVH3T6o,119680,121600,learned that christmas trees are
ItxIvVH3T6o,121600,123920,actually non-toxic well
ItxIvVH3T6o,123920,126079,not all christmas trees just some
ItxIvVH3T6o,126079,128479,christmas trees but hey there's a
ItxIvVH3T6o,128479,130720,possibility of you being able to eat the
ItxIvVH3T6o,130720,132640,entirety of your christmas trees all the
ItxIvVH3T6o,132640,134319,way down the line instead of throwing it
ItxIvVH3T6o,134319,135360,out to the curb you could eat your
ItxIvVH3T6o,135360,137120,christmas tree so we decided to do that
ItxIvVH3T6o,137120,138720,and then we decided that just because
ItxIvVH3T6o,138720,140400,you can do something you probably
ItxIvVH3T6o,140400,142800,shouldn't necessarily do it because it
ItxIvVH3T6o,142800,145200,was the worst and just like that my
ItxIvVH3T6o,145200,147040,dreams of consuming my entire christmas
ItxIvVH3T6o,147040,149360,tree were gone at least until earlier
ItxIvVH3T6o,149360,151360,this year that is when i saw a video
ItxIvVH3T6o,151360,153760,from william osman and idubbbz in which
ItxIvVH3T6o,153760,156319,they tried to sneak as much sawdust as
ItxIvVH3T6o,156319,158959,they could inside of rice krispie treats
ItxIvVH3T6o,158959,160720,in fact i think they discovered that you
ItxIvVH3T6o,160720,163120,could get around a third of the crispy
ItxIvVH3T6o,163120,165599,treat swapped out for sawdust and so i
ItxIvVH3T6o,165599,168000,was like aha my dream of being able to
ItxIvVH3T6o,168000,170239,eat my entire christmas tree lives again
ItxIvVH3T6o,170239,171599,what if we sneak it into christmas
ItxIvVH3T6o,171599,173440,cookies those things are really sweet
ItxIvVH3T6o,173440,174720,there's a lot of places that you could
ItxIvVH3T6o,174720,177360,hide sawdust there what if i grind up a
ItxIvVH3T6o,177360,179760,christmas tree and consume it that way
ItxIvVH3T6o,179760,181519,so that my friends is the crazy
ItxIvVH3T6o,181519,184800,experiment that we're on today round two
ItxIvVH3T6o,184800,186319,eating it the traditional way didn't
ItxIvVH3T6o,186319,188560,work so what if we sneak it into a whole
ItxIvVH3T6o,188560,190879,bunch of cookies question number one how
ItxIvVH3T6o,190879,192800,much sawdust can we get away with inside
ItxIvVH3T6o,192800,194720,of our christmas cookies and question
ItxIvVH3T6o,194720,197040,number two if we're able to do that how
ItxIvVH3T6o,197040,198879,many christmas cookies would we need to
ItxIvVH3T6o,198879,201280,consume in order to eat the entire
ItxIvVH3T6o,201280,204319,christmas tree is it a dumb idea
ItxIvVH3T6o,204319,206640,yes but it was also dumb the first time
ItxIvVH3T6o,206640,208560,i feel like this one might be less dumb
ItxIvVH3T6o,208560,212239,in fact i predict my hypothesis my food
ItxIvVH3T6o,212239,214400,hypothesis is that this one is actually
ItxIvVH3T6o,214400,216560,going to be tastier than last year maybe
ItxIvVH3T6o,216560,218480,by year three will actually determine
ItxIvVH3T6o,218480,220560,something that's actually edible so
ItxIvVH3T6o,220560,221840,first things first let's actually talk
ItxIvVH3T6o,221840,223440,about the sawdust that we're using here
ItxIvVH3T6o,223440,225519,which likes to brand itself as wood
ItxIvVH3T6o,225519,226640,flour
ItxIvVH3T6o,226640,228480,but it's actually a fine sawdust that's
ItxIvVH3T6o,228480,230400,been filtered in order to eliminate all
ItxIvVH3T6o,230400,232560,those lumps you know because when you're
ItxIvVH3T6o,232560,234560,baking with sawdust you don't want those
ItxIvVH3T6o,234560,235840,lumps in there it's not like mashed
ItxIvVH3T6o,235840,237680,potatoes or anything so this actually
ItxIvVH3T6o,237680,239519,isn't me going out and grinding up my
ItxIvVH3T6o,239519,240720,own christmas tree this is actually the
ItxIvVH3T6o,240720,242080,same stuff that william osman and
ItxIvVH3T6o,242080,244560,idubbbz used for their video and when
ItxIvVH3T6o,244560,245760,you open it up it's actually really
ItxIvVH3T6o,245760,248480,interesting the the texture of it is
ItxIvVH3T6o,248480,250879,actually incredibly soft it does feel
ItxIvVH3T6o,250879,254000,like a fine powder similar to like a
ItxIvVH3T6o,254000,255120,flower
ItxIvVH3T6o,255120,256959,it's a little bit grainier like as i'm
ItxIvVH3T6o,256959,258400,digging around in it it's kind of
ItxIvVH3T6o,258400,260479,sticking to itself a bit
ItxIvVH3T6o,260479,262320,flour usually kind of shifts around so
ItxIvVH3T6o,262320,264720,it does feel slightly different but for
ItxIvVH3T6o,264720,266400,the most part almost totally
ItxIvVH3T6o,266400,268400,interchangeable with flour it's also
ItxIvVH3T6o,268400,271360,worth noting that this should be okay to
ItxIvVH3T6o,271360,274240,consume they do say avoid breathing dust
ItxIvVH3T6o,274240,275840,you can consume it but just don't
ItxIvVH3T6o,275840,277919,breathe in the dust of it so first
ItxIvVH3T6o,277919,279520,things first we have to determine how
ItxIvVH3T6o,279520,281759,much sawdust is too much sawdust for
ItxIvVH3T6o,281759,283360,your christmas cookie at which point
ItxIvVH3T6o,283360,286479,does it feel decidedly less festive to
ItxIvVH3T6o,286479,288400,eat we're gonna start with just four
ItxIvVH3T6o,288400,290960,ounces of basic sugar cookie dough easy
ItxIvVH3T6o,290960,293120,standard it should be delicious from
ItxIvVH3T6o,293120,294639,there we're gonna mix in various
ItxIvVH3T6o,294639,297360,percentages of sawdust to see at which
ItxIvVH3T6o,297360,299600,point does the cookie start to become
ItxIvVH3T6o,299600,302080,a little bit more questionable and then
ItxIvVH3T6o,302080,304160,on top of that we're gonna figure out if
ItxIvVH3T6o,304160,306080,we can mix some sawdust into the icing
ItxIvVH3T6o,306080,307680,as well because that's another place
ItxIvVH3T6o,307680,309440,that we can hide this stuff so without
ItxIvVH3T6o,309440,311440,any further ado let's start mixing some
ItxIvVH3T6o,311440,312880,dough first off we're going to measure
ItxIvVH3T6o,312880,314080,out this dough
ItxIvVH3T6o,314080,316800,for perfect 100 dough should be
ItxIvVH3T6o,316800,319199,delicious this is our control group so
ItxIvVH3T6o,319199,320800,we've got our control next thing we're
ItxIvVH3T6o,320800,323360,going to do is mix in various amounts of
ItxIvVH3T6o,323360,324880,sawdust to get us our various
ItxIvVH3T6o,324880,327360,percentages so first we're going to do
ItxIvVH3T6o,327360,329440,0.4 ounces
ItxIvVH3T6o,329440,331120,of sawdust and then we're going to mix
ItxIvVH3T6o,331120,333840,that in with 3.6
ItxIvVH3T6o,333840,336080,ounces of the cookie dough which in
ItxIvVH3T6o,336080,338400,total should get us up to
ItxIvVH3T6o,338400,339360,10
ItxIvVH3T6o,339360,341360,of the cookie and we're doing this by
ItxIvVH3T6o,341360,343520,weight since things are gonna change a
ItxIvVH3T6o,343520,345840,little bit when we actually bake them so
ItxIvVH3T6o,345840,347440,point four ounces of sawdust going right
ItxIvVH3T6o,347440,348639,in the bowl
ItxIvVH3T6o,348639,350880,now we're gonna mix it in with
ItxIvVH3T6o,350880,353840,our three six ounces
ItxIvVH3T6o,353840,355520,of cookie dough and that should give us
ItxIvVH3T6o,355520,356560,our 10
ItxIvVH3T6o,356560,358160,sawdust cookie
ItxIvVH3T6o,358160,360479,exciting times and then we're just going
ItxIvVH3T6o,360479,361759,to do that over and over again at
ItxIvVH3T6o,361759,363680,different percentages which we will show
ItxIvVH3T6o,363680,365600,you on screen right now isn't that right
ItxIvVH3T6o,365600,367680,editors oh my gosh there's no way that
ItxIvVH3T6o,367680,369199,we're getting yeah this does not look
ItxIvVH3T6o,369199,371280,appetizing at all and this is only 10
ItxIvVH3T6o,371280,375600,i'm very concerned about this this is 10
ItxIvVH3T6o,378240,380720,so um this
ItxIvVH3T6o,380720,382880,is not working at all kind of makes
ItxIvVH3T6o,382880,384160,sense if i had stepped back and thought
ItxIvVH3T6o,384160,385840,about this before i started putting on
ItxIvVH3T6o,385840,388080,the cameras because we're already
ItxIvVH3T6o,388080,390080,dealing with dough by using that i'm
ItxIvVH3T6o,390080,392240,already using pre-made dough so i'm just
ItxIvVH3T6o,392240,394800,trying to mix in more flour in this case
ItxIvVH3T6o,394800,396720,sawdust flour mix in more flour into
ItxIvVH3T6o,396720,397919,something that already has the
ItxIvVH3T6o,397919,399680,appropriate amount of flour in it so i'm
ItxIvVH3T6o,399680,401440,just adding more to the mix thereby
ItxIvVH3T6o,401440,403199,making it drier so i guess i just have
ItxIvVH3T6o,403199,404479,to make dough from scratch and instead
ItxIvVH3T6o,404479,405919,of incorporating flour into something
ItxIvVH3T6o,405919,408240,that already exists instead using this
ItxIvVH3T6o,408240,410960,as a flower alternative and mixing it in
ItxIvVH3T6o,410960,412720,in various amounts to achieve those
ItxIvVH3T6o,412720,413919,percentages that we were talking about
ItxIvVH3T6o,413919,416560,before so catchy on the other side and
ItxIvVH3T6o,416560,418560,we're back after considering our life
ItxIvVH3T6o,418560,420800,choices so the problem with the original
ItxIvVH3T6o,420800,422880,dough plan was that the dough was
ItxIvVH3T6o,422880,425199,already made so all the requisite flour
ItxIvVH3T6o,425199,427440,for that dough was already mixed in if
ItxIvVH3T6o,427440,429199,we want the sawdust to actually serve as
ItxIvVH3T6o,429199,431360,a flour replacement we have to go back
ItxIvVH3T6o,431360,434240,to scratch so we found a sugar cookie
ItxIvVH3T6o,434240,436080,recipe that calls for one and a half
ItxIvVH3T6o,436080,438880,cups of flour so this is going to be our
ItxIvVH3T6o,438880,440720,control from here though we're going to
ItxIvVH3T6o,440720,442880,make other doughs that are mixing in
ItxIvVH3T6o,442880,445039,sawdust to replace certain amounts of
ItxIvVH3T6o,445039,449520,the flour 10 20 30 etc by weight so
ItxIvVH3T6o,449520,452560,weighing this in it came in at 228 grams
ItxIvVH3T6o,452560,454319,for a cup and a half of flour so what
ItxIvVH3T6o,454319,457599,we're going to do is take 22.8
ItxIvVH3T6o,457599,460720,grams of sawdust which is 10
ItxIvVH3T6o,460720,463120,of that amount mix it in add the rest
ItxIvVH3T6o,463120,465440,into flour and boom that's your 10
ItxIvVH3T6o,465440,467759,cookie and so on and so forth show up
ItxIvVH3T6o,467759,470000,the chart editors
ItxIvVH3T6o,470000,472879,boom it's gonna appear right here
ItxIvVH3T6o,472879,475120,and now it's gonna move over here
ItxIvVH3T6o,475120,476960,now it's gonna move right in the middle
ItxIvVH3T6o,476960,478639,there it is there's your math
ItxIvVH3T6o,478639,480000,hopefully they did everything that i
ItxIvVH3T6o,480000,481599,just asked them to do
ItxIvVH3T6o,481599,483199,knowing the editors they didn't do that
ItxIvVH3T6o,483199,487039,so we're doing 22.8 grams of sawdust to
ItxIvVH3T6o,487039,489599,replace in the flour that'll give us our
ItxIvVH3T6o,489599,492879,10 cookie here 22.7 okay so this my
ItxIvVH3T6o,492879,496639,friends is our 10 cookie 228 grams mixed
ItxIvVH3T6o,496639,499440,in here of flour and sawdust 10 made of
ItxIvVH3T6o,499440,501120,sawdust so now
ItxIvVH3T6o,501120,504479,we're gonna do it 20 30 40 50
ItxIvVH3T6o,504479,506879,cue the montage i don't have much
ItxIvVH3T6o,506879,509360,footage of me doing the flower
ItxIvVH3T6o,509360,510879,matt's saying don't queue any montage
ItxIvVH3T6o,510879,514479,because that footage doesn't exist so um
ItxIvVH3T6o,514479,517120,cue the transition so we've measured out
ItxIvVH3T6o,517120,519518,all our sawdust flower combinations here
ItxIvVH3T6o,519518,522399,and i gotta say initial observation i'm
ItxIvVH3T6o,522399,524000,concerned about the stability of these
ItxIvVH3T6o,524000,526080,cookies take for instance the 50 mix
ItxIvVH3T6o,526080,528399,here what you immediately notice is the
ItxIvVH3T6o,528399,530320,huge amount of volume of sawdust
ItxIvVH3T6o,530320,532800,relative to the little amount of flour
ItxIvVH3T6o,532800,535839,this is a 50 50 mix of flour to sawdust
ItxIvVH3T6o,535839,537920,by weight the important thing there is
ItxIvVH3T6o,537920,540399,that the sawdust is so much less dense
ItxIvVH3T6o,540399,542880,than the flour it is so much lighter as
ItxIvVH3T6o,542880,545519,a result you need a lot more sawdust to
ItxIvVH3T6o,545519,546959,match the amount of flour that you're
ItxIvVH3T6o,546959,548720,putting in here i think that that's
ItxIvVH3T6o,548720,550560,gonna translate to some very unstable
ItxIvVH3T6o,550560,552800,and very crumbly cookies since flour is
ItxIvVH3T6o,552800,554160,you know the thing that's helping to
ItxIvVH3T6o,554160,556240,hold all this together and i don't think
ItxIvVH3T6o,556240,558000,sawdust is really gonna stand in for
ItxIvVH3T6o,558000,559600,that so
ItxIvVH3T6o,559600,561360,i don't know friends i would be
ItxIvVH3T6o,561360,563519,surprised to see if we get a solid
ItxIvVH3T6o,563519,567200,stable cookie beyond the 20 mark at this
ItxIvVH3T6o,567200,568880,point it's time to actually make all
ItxIvVH3T6o,568880,570959,these individual doughs which means you
ItxIvVH3T6o,570959,572320,know at this point we're just making a
ItxIvVH3T6o,572320,574320,regular sugar cookie dough so we got our
ItxIvVH3T6o,574320,576080,sugar we got our baking powder we got
ItxIvVH3T6o,576080,578240,our milk egg vanilla all that stuff
ItxIvVH3T6o,578240,579760,everything else is gonna be running as
ItxIvVH3T6o,579760,582240,normal the only variable here is the
ItxIvVH3T6o,582240,583760,amount of sawdust in the flour mixture
ItxIvVH3T6o,583760,585120,so we're gonna run through this six
ItxIvVH3T6o,585120,587200,times just to get us started making some
ItxIvVH3T6o,587200,589360,basic cookie mix here so uh starting off
ItxIvVH3T6o,589360,592240,with our wet ingredients a half cup of
ItxIvVH3T6o,592240,595600,butter half cup that's the whole stick
ItxIvVH3T6o,595600,598320,no wonder everyone loves cookies so much
ItxIvVH3T6o,598320,600399,boom there it is whole thing in the pot
ItxIvVH3T6o,600399,605000,half cup of sugar and mix
ItxIvVH3T6o,606720,608800,all right doing a great job creaming in
ItxIvVH3T6o,608800,609920,there
ItxIvVH3T6o,609920,611279,matt is behind the camera being like
ItxIvVH3T6o,611279,613519,you're so stressful when you're cooking
ItxIvVH3T6o,613519,615839,and i so enlighten me what should i do
ItxIvVH3T6o,615839,616640,matt
ItxIvVH3T6o,616640,618640,everything differently everything
ItxIvVH3T6o,618640,620640,different why what what would i do well
ItxIvVH3T6o,620640,621760,first off the butter was supposed to be
ItxIvVH3T6o,621760,623839,softened and this is hard as a rock it's
ItxIvVH3T6o,623839,625680,the energy that you bring to the kitchen
ItxIvVH3T6o,625680,628000,it's the energy that i bring what that i
ItxIvVH3T6o,628000,630160,want things to work it's a stressful day
ItxIvVH3T6o,630160,634639,matt okay leave me alone
ItxIvVH3T6o,634800,637120,in my aggressive baking i dropped a
ItxIvVH3T6o,637120,639120,giant globule of butter sugar on the
ItxIvVH3T6o,639120,640320,floor
ItxIvVH3T6o,640320,643120,five second rule it's fine next up with
ItxIvVH3T6o,643120,645279,stressful times cooking with matpat
ItxIvVH3T6o,645279,647920,we're adding in our flour and sawdust
ItxIvVH3T6o,647920,650000,mixture in gradually with our wet
ItxIvVH3T6o,650000,651440,ingredients over here all right so last
ItxIvVH3T6o,651440,652240,up
ItxIvVH3T6o,652240,655360,baking powder and salt that's that guy
ItxIvVH3T6o,655360,657519,and lastly we've got a little pinch of
ItxIvVH3T6o,657519,658560,salt
ItxIvVH3T6o,658560,661279,so this is our sawdust dough ten percent
ItxIvVH3T6o,661279,663200,it's a little bit drier than i think a
ItxIvVH3T6o,663200,665120,normal sugar cookie dough would be but
ItxIvVH3T6o,665120,667200,not by too much and that could just be
ItxIvVH3T6o,667200,668800,my imagination because i know what's in
ItxIvVH3T6o,668800,670880,here there's raw egg in this i'm not
ItxIvVH3T6o,670880,672800,so supposed to eat it but i like to live
ItxIvVH3T6o,672800,675839,on the edge so
ItxIvVH3T6o,678240,681120,i don't know if it's just my imagination
ItxIvVH3T6o,681120,682160,tastes like i'm eating a little bit of
ItxIvVH3T6o,682160,683040,wood
ItxIvVH3T6o,683040,684800,definitely feels like i'm like
ItxIvVH3T6o,684800,686399,eating a cookie and then chewing on a
ItxIvVH3T6o,686399,688320,toothpick i'm also noticing that
ItxIvVH3T6o,688320,690320,immediately you can tell that there is a
ItxIvVH3T6o,690320,692399,browner color than than kind of you
ItxIvVH3T6o,692399,693760,would associate with a normal
ItxIvVH3T6o,693760,695839,traditional sugar cookie so the sawdust
ItxIvVH3T6o,695839,698160,is already making itself known even
ItxIvVH3T6o,698160,700160,though it's only at 10 interestingly
ItxIvVH3T6o,700160,701279,enough though
ItxIvVH3T6o,701279,703279,you know still very good consistency
ItxIvVH3T6o,703279,706000,still a great dough i'd be able to make
ItxIvVH3T6o,706000,707839,this into a cookie no problem so from a
ItxIvVH3T6o,707839,710399,consistency standpoint that feels about
ItxIvVH3T6o,710399,713279,the same but from a flavor standpoint
ItxIvVH3T6o,713279,715040,you might be able to tell already that's
ItxIvVH3T6o,715040,716320,one of the reasons why stephanie has to
ItxIvVH3T6o,716320,718160,stay a neutral observer in this little
ItxIvVH3T6o,718160,720000,experiment because she doesn't know
ItxIvVH3T6o,720000,721839,what's coming to her she thinks there's
ItxIvVH3T6o,721839,723440,just gonna be a bunch of christmas joy
ItxIvVH3T6o,723440,725120,headed her way
ItxIvVH3T6o,725120,726800,little does she know that she's gonna be
ItxIvVH3T6o,726800,728880,munching on a two by four our does are
ItxIvVH3T6o,728880,730560,all made and immediately you can start
ItxIvVH3T6o,730560,732240,to tell a couple differences here my
ItxIvVH3T6o,732240,734480,friends first and foremost hey when you
ItxIvVH3T6o,734480,736320,don't have any sawdust in your cookie
ItxIvVH3T6o,736320,739519,dough it looks normal it tastes normal
ItxIvVH3T6o,739519,742959,it behaves normally on the other end of
ItxIvVH3T6o,742959,748240,that spectrum you got wow at 30 sawdust
ItxIvVH3T6o,748240,751040,you got basically sand in a bag and then
ItxIvVH3T6o,751040,752560,40
ItxIvVH3T6o,752560,754959,is still in saran wrap for a reason
ItxIvVH3T6o,754959,756480,because as soon as i open this thing up
ItxIvVH3T6o,756480,758720,it's tumbling everywhere we didn't even
ItxIvVH3T6o,758720,760240,try with 50
ItxIvVH3T6o,760240,763440,let's be honest 50 is still 50 in the
ItxIvVH3T6o,763440,765600,bowl and that's where it's gonna stay so
ItxIvVH3T6o,765600,767839,there really does seem to be a critical
ItxIvVH3T6o,767839,770959,differentiator here between 20 sawdust
ItxIvVH3T6o,770959,774160,and 30 sawdust and immediately as we
ItxIvVH3T6o,774160,775519,were mixing it up you could tell that
ItxIvVH3T6o,775519,777760,the sawdust was just absorbing the
ItxIvVH3T6o,777760,779600,liquids that we were putting into it so
ItxIvVH3T6o,779600,781839,much faster and so much more completely
ItxIvVH3T6o,781839,784160,that it wasn't able to adhere as a dough
ItxIvVH3T6o,784160,786399,so it seems like 20 is gonna be our
ItxIvVH3T6o,786399,788560,sweet spot here but to know for sure we
ItxIvVH3T6o,788560,790240,gotta bake them up which means rolling
ItxIvVH3T6o,790240,792480,them out and cutting out
ItxIvVH3T6o,792480,793920,in true form
ItxIvVH3T6o,793920,795760,christmas trees look
ItxIvVH3T6o,795760,797279,based on the coloring of this you would
ItxIvVH3T6o,797279,798560,think that this is a delightful
ItxIvVH3T6o,798560,800560,gingerbread like i see this and i'm like
ItxIvVH3T6o,800560,803600,ooh it's a nice soft gingerbread boom
ItxIvVH3T6o,803600,805519,like that
ItxIvVH3T6o,805519,807440,you know how when you go to like home
ItxIvVH3T6o,807440,808959,depot or something to choose a color of
ItxIvVH3T6o,808959,810399,paint you get those color swatches of
ItxIvVH3T6o,810399,812639,like well here's the light brown option
ItxIvVH3T6o,812639,814240,here's the darker brown option and
ItxIvVH3T6o,814240,816480,here's the black option i feel like this
ItxIvVH3T6o,816480,818959,is the same way here's the light brown
ItxIvVH3T6o,818959,820320,here's the dark brown and here's the
ItxIvVH3T6o,820320,822880,black so there you go friends
ItxIvVH3T6o,822880,824959,probably in that order of flavor as well
ItxIvVH3T6o,824959,826839,here's 30
ItxIvVH3T6o,826839,829600,mm like playing with less enjoyable
ItxIvVH3T6o,829600,831839,kinetic sand maybe we'll get a cookie
ItxIvVH3T6o,831839,834320,out of this maybe we can squeeze out two
ItxIvVH3T6o,834320,838320,do we have a cookie we do
ItxIvVH3T6o,839120,841199,all right all right you're going to make
ItxIvVH3T6o,841199,844160,something out of it do we dare spit in
ItxIvVH3T6o,844160,846480,the face of the gods and tempt fate and
ItxIvVH3T6o,846480,848000,say you know what we're going to make a
ItxIvVH3T6o,848000,852160,40 cookie can we do it
ItxIvVH3T6o,854800,856480,look get my maybe if i squeeze it really
ItxIvVH3T6o,856480,857420,hard
ItxIvVH3T6o,857420,858800,[Music]
ItxIvVH3T6o,858800,861680,oh it does stick together slightly
ItxIvVH3T6o,861680,864399,look ah look it you can create a ball
ItxIvVH3T6o,864399,869000,out of it a little sawdust ball
ItxIvVH3T6o,871279,873600,so we're down to our final three you are
ItxIvVH3T6o,873600,876160,the three you are our last great hope
ItxIvVH3T6o,876160,878959,so miraculously we managed to get some
ItxIvVH3T6o,878959,880880,cookies out of all these doughs
ItxIvVH3T6o,880880,883360,obviously the less sawdust was a lot
ItxIvVH3T6o,883360,886480,easier but even over in 30 sawdust land
ItxIvVH3T6o,886480,888560,we got something that vaguely resembles
ItxIvVH3T6o,888560,891040,a put together solid thick christmas
ItxIvVH3T6o,891040,892560,cookies so
ItxIvVH3T6o,892560,894800,into the oven they go and we'll see what
ItxIvVH3T6o,894800,896399,comes out alright so i just pulled the
ItxIvVH3T6o,896399,898480,cookies out of the oven and i gotta say
ItxIvVH3T6o,898480,900880,what looked a little bit sketchy in
ItxIvVH3T6o,900880,903600,dough form is actually looking really
ItxIvVH3T6o,903600,905120,passable now that everything's fully
ItxIvVH3T6o,905120,907279,cooked so at this point we just need our
ItxIvVH3T6o,907279,909519,neutral observer to give us her verdict
ItxIvVH3T6o,909519,912160,so i'm going to label these uh one to
ItxIvVH3T6o,912160,913920,four so that way i can know which ones
ItxIvVH3T6o,913920,915360,are which and which ones correspond to
ItxIvVH3T6o,915360,917279,which amount of sawdust and then from
ItxIvVH3T6o,917279,919760,there we'll get a stephanie's
ItxIvVH3T6o,919760,922079,objective opinion as to how they taste
ItxIvVH3T6o,922079,924880,so my cookies are all prepared time to
ItxIvVH3T6o,924880,926480,get our objective taste test from
ItxIvVH3T6o,926480,929120,stephanie steph you busy
ItxIvVH3T6o,929120,930880,oh what's up
ItxIvVH3T6o,930880,933040,uh can you i i have a little surprise
ItxIvVH3T6o,933040,935120,for you can you can you come down steph

ItxIvVH3T6o,941600,945190,just worried about what's going on here
ItxIvVH3T6o,945190,947759,[Laughter]
ItxIvVH3T6o,947759,949839,didn't you bake something i did i made

ItxIvVH3T6o,968560,970160,number four i'm noticing that someone
ItxIvVH3T6o,970160,974480,left him in the oven just a tad too long
ItxIvVH3T6o,976240,977839,yeah that's right they were left in the
ItxIvVH3T6o,977839,980240,oven slightly too long oh but they taste
ItxIvVH3T6o,980240,982399,really good oh i'm sorry i'm in front of

ItxIvVH3T6o,1040558,1041520,it looks like it's more like a
ItxIvVH3T6o,1041520,1042880,gingerbread cookie sometimes like a
ItxIvVH3T6o,1042880,1044640,gingerbread ginger snap that's where you

ItxIvVH3T6o,1050400,1053559,all right
ItxIvVH3T6o,1060240,1062000,it's weird because it still tastes sweet
ItxIvVH3T6o,1062000,1064400,okay ish good but it's much less sweet
ItxIvVH3T6o,1064400,1065840,than like this one i don't get any of
ItxIvVH3T6o,1065840,1067280,the butter at all and then like the
ItxIvVH3T6o,1067280,1069600,first few bites it was fine
ItxIvVH3T6o,1069600,1071679,what is this no i don't know
ItxIvVH3T6o,1071679,1073200,matt what is this cookie i'm getting an
ItxIvVH3T6o,1073200,1075120,uncomfortable feeling in my mouth it's
ItxIvVH3T6o,1075120,1076000,kind of
ItxIvVH3T6o,1076000,1078480,kind of gritty oh interesting it sits on
ItxIvVH3T6o,1078480,1080320,the back of my tongue in a weird way
ItxIvVH3T6o,1080320,1082559,what's in this cookie
ItxIvVH3T6o,1082559,1084880,i mean it's the bark you put the bark in
ItxIvVH3T6o,1084880,1088400,or something dumb oh it's sawdust
ItxIvVH3T6o,1088400,1091039,it's it's literal sawdust
ItxIvVH3T6o,1091039,1094400,i mean it's what cussing out how much of
ItxIvVH3T6o,1094400,1095520,a tree
ItxIvVH3T6o,1095520,1098320,you can put into a cookie
ItxIvVH3T6o,1098320,1100240,to try and eat your christmas cookie
ItxIvVH3T6o,1100240,1103039,there's sawdust in this how much sawdust
ItxIvVH3T6o,1103039,1106320,is in here is this whole thing oh 30 by
ItxIvVH3T6o,1106320,1107550,weight
ItxIvVH3T6o,1107550,1110960,[Laughter]
ItxIvVH3T6o,1110960,1112400,30
ItxIvVH3T6o,1112400,1114720,oh god no wonder i feel sick i feel like
ItxIvVH3T6o,1114720,1117440,no no it's fine it's edible sawdust it's
ItxIvVH3T6o,1117440,1120000,fine it's non-toxic totally safe
ItxIvVH3T6o,1120000,1122080,for wood glue i do want to try one last
ItxIvVH3T6o,1122080,1124240,thing though because a naked christmas
ItxIvVH3T6o,1124240,1125280,cookie
ItxIvVH3T6o,1125280,1127120,is not the greatest right so you're
ItxIvVH3T6o,1127120,1128880,saying that the flavor started to really
ItxIvVH3T6o,1128880,1131440,decline around the 20 to 30 mark right
ItxIvVH3T6o,1131440,1134960,so what i'd love to try is if we did 30
ItxIvVH3T6o,1134960,1138880,i'm not tasting that again if we did 20
ItxIvVH3T6o,1138880,1140480,but with icing
ItxIvVH3T6o,1140480,1142000,seasonal holiday icing and then you
ItxIvVH3T6o,1142000,1144160,could tell me does the icing actually
ItxIvVH3T6o,1144160,1148160,cover up the flavor of the sawdust
ItxIvVH3T6o,1148559,1152320,this one is softer the softer bake
ItxIvVH3T6o,1152320,1153919,i can't believe i was like complimenting
ItxIvVH3T6o,1153919,1155520,the way that these were cooked the
ItxIvVH3T6o,1155520,1156720,texture you can't cover up with the
ItxIvVH3T6o,1156720,1159039,icing yeah but the flavor hands down
ItxIvVH3T6o,1159039,1160960,easy the flavor is almost exactly the
ItxIvVH3T6o,1160960,1162240,same as this one and i think it would be
ItxIvVH3T6o,1162240,1163600,almost exactly as the same as the
ItxIvVH3T6o,1163600,1165760,control 2. knowing that we can get away
ItxIvVH3T6o,1165760,1168240,with about 44 grams of sawdust in a
ItxIvVH3T6o,1168240,1170480,typical batch of cookie dough here the
ItxIvVH3T6o,1170480,1172799,question now remains
ItxIvVH3T6o,1172799,1174160,how many cookies do we need to eat in
ItxIvVH3T6o,1174160,1176240,order to consume the entirety of the
ItxIvVH3T6o,1176240,1178960,christmas tree stuff oh boy just one
ItxIvVH3T6o,1178960,1180640,cookie at a time that sounds like a
ItxIvVH3T6o,1180640,1184160,question for vo vo matpat do that
ItxIvVH3T6o,1184160,1186000,calculation and take it home happy to
ItxIvVH3T6o,1186000,1187919,take it from there past matpat so as we
ItxIvVH3T6o,1187919,1189919,mentioned earlier there were 228 grams
ItxIvVH3T6o,1189919,1191840,of flour in the dough recipe and we
ItxIvVH3T6o,1191840,1194160,settled on the 20 sawdust cookie as the
ItxIvVH3T6o,1194160,1196320,acceptable amount of wood inside our
ItxIvVH3T6o,1196320,1198960,dessert which meant 45.6 grams of
ItxIvVH3T6o,1198960,1201120,sawdust in each batch now a typical
ItxIvVH3T6o,1201120,1203280,christmas tree weighs in at about 59
ItxIvVH3T6o,1203280,1205240,pounds or 26
ItxIvVH3T6o,1205240,1208080,762 grams so dividing that by the amount
ItxIvVH3T6o,1208080,1209600,of sawdust we're using in each dough
ItxIvVH3T6o,1209600,1211320,gives us
ItxIvVH3T6o,1211320,1215120,587 which is a lot of cookies to eat in
ItxIvVH3T6o,1215120,1216720,order to consume an entire christmas
ItxIvVH3T6o,1216720,1218480,tree but remember that's not the amount
ItxIvVH3T6o,1218480,1220799,of cookies that's the amount of batches
ItxIvVH3T6o,1220799,1222799,of cookies each glob of dough is going
ItxIvVH3T6o,1222799,1224880,to make you about 18 cookies which means
ItxIvVH3T6o,1224880,1226559,that to eat an entire christmas tree
ItxIvVH3T6o,1226559,1228640,you're not looking at 500 cookies you're
ItxIvVH3T6o,1228640,1230559,looking at 10
ItxIvVH3T6o,1230559,1232799,500 specifically 10
ItxIvVH3T6o,1232799,1234640,560
ItxIvVH3T6o,1234640,1236480,that is uh not gonna jive well with the
ItxIvVH3T6o,1236480,1238640,whole new year's diet statistics say an
ItxIvVH3T6o,1238640,1240559,average person will eat 300 cookies in a
ItxIvVH3T6o,1240559,1241760,year to get through that tree we're
ItxIvVH3T6o,1241760,1244720,talking 35 times that amount in short if
ItxIvVH3T6o,1244720,1245679,you wanted to get through the whole
ItxIvVH3T6o,1245679,1247520,thing by the end of january you need to
ItxIvVH3T6o,1247520,1248679,be eating about
ItxIvVH3T6o,1248679,1252159,341 cookies per day but alright i'm in
ItxIvVH3T6o,1252159,1254080,it for the long term i can be patient as
ItxIvVH3T6o,1254080,1255440,long as that thing is used up before i
ItxIvVH3T6o,1255440,1257440,buy my next new tree for the following
ItxIvVH3T6o,1257440,1259120,christmas we should be all good so how
ItxIvVH3T6o,1259120,1260720,many cookies am i talking about then
ItxIvVH3T6o,1260720,1262960,well you're still looking at 33 cookies
ItxIvVH3T6o,1262960,1264720,per day and while i love me some
ItxIvVH3T6o,1264720,1266960,christmas cookies my waistline does not
ItxIvVH3T6o,1266960,1268400,you'd basically be getting your entire
ItxIvVH3T6o,1268400,1270480,daily recommended calorie limit per day
ItxIvVH3T6o,1270480,1272400,on cookies and not even good ones either
ItxIvVH3T6o,1272400,1274240,we're talking about cookies that are 20
ItxIvVH3T6o,1274240,1276720,wood meaning that yet again i'm defeated
ItxIvVH3T6o,1276720,1278640,first you christmas tree it's almost
ItxIvVH3T6o,1278640,1280080,like you were never meant to be eaten in
ItxIvVH3T6o,1280080,1282559,the first place but i'll be back maybe i
ItxIvVH3T6o,1282559,1284640,mean i just consumed way too much fiber
ItxIvVH3T6o,1284640,1286159,so no promises i may still be in the
ItxIvVH3T6o,1286159,1287760,bathroom this time next year and all of
ItxIvVH3T6o,1287760,1289120,this is without even me talking about
ItxIvVH3T6o,1289120,1290799,stephanie's question from earlier are
ItxIvVH3T6o,1290799,1292720,sawdust cookies safe to eat in the first
ItxIvVH3T6o,1292720,1294880,place probably not in those quantities
ItxIvVH3T6o,1294880,1296400,honestly i don't think any cookie
ItxIvVH3T6o,1296400,1298240,sawdust or no is gonna be safe in those
ItxIvVH3T6o,1298240,1300159,quantities you know what is safe though

ItxIvVH3T6o,1311200,1312720,security system is just one of those
ItxIvVH3T6o,1312720,1314640,things that it's easy to make excuses to
ItxIvVH3T6o,1314640,1316960,not invest in it's expensive the systems
ItxIvVH3T6o,1316960,1318480,are hard to install the footage looks
ItxIvVH3T6o,1318480,1320720,like it was taken on a 2008 prius backup

ItxIvVH3T6o,1382880,1384720,food theory to learn more link is in the
ItxIvVH3T6o,1384720,1385840,top line of the description because
ItxIvVH3T6o,1385840,1387440,simply safe is spelled in a funny way
ItxIvVH3T6o,1387440,1389919,again that is a savings of 40 or more if
ItxIvVH3T6o,1389919,1392080,you are remotely curious that link is
ItxIvVH3T6o,1392080,1394320,down in the description and as always
ItxIvVH3T6o,1394320,1396799,remember friends it's all just a theory
ItxIvVH3T6o,1396799,1400919,a food theory
vid,start,end,text
ItxIvVH3T6o,80,2159,almost exactly one year ago i tried to
ItxIvVH3T6o,2159,4880,do the impossible eat my own christmas
ItxIvVH3T6o,4880,7200,tree why because i'm a youtuber did i
ItxIvVH3T6o,7200,8480,say more i learned that some trees are
ItxIvVH3T6o,8480,10240,non-toxic and i was all like i can eat
ItxIvVH3T6o,10240,12160,you but there's a big difference between
ItxIvVH3T6o,12160,14240,something being possible in theory and
ItxIvVH3T6o,14240,15920,something being done in reality and as
ItxIvVH3T6o,15920,17279,you might expect when i tried to eat an
ItxIvVH3T6o,17279,20320,entire christmas tree the results were
ItxIvVH3T6o,20320,23359,mixed yep it's true but now i'm back to
ItxIvVH3T6o,23359,26720,try again a year older and a year wiser
ItxIvVH3T6o,26720,28160,though apparently not wise enough to
ItxIvVH3T6o,28160,30240,just scrap the entire idea out right so
ItxIvVH3T6o,30240,33360,again i ask the question can i eat my
ItxIvVH3T6o,33360,35840,entire christmas tree only this time can
ItxIvVH3T6o,35840,38239,i eat it disguised as these better yet
ItxIvVH3T6o,38239,40800,can i trick steph into helping me loyal
ItxIvVH3T6o,40800,42719,theorists break out the sandpaper
ItxIvVH3T6o,42719,45039,because we're sneaking sawdust to santa
ItxIvVH3T6o,45039,46879,claus hopefully it doesn't get us on the
ItxIvVH3T6o,46879,51559,naughty list or sent to the hospital
ItxIvVH3T6o,60890,62879,[Music]
ItxIvVH3T6o,62879,66000,hello internet welcome to food theory
ItxIvVH3T6o,66000,68000,where today it's the season of giving
ItxIvVH3T6o,68000,69600,giving your loved ones holiday cookies
ItxIvVH3T6o,69600,71600,filled with sawdust that is today it's
ItxIvVH3T6o,71600,73439,round two and what has inexplicably
ItxIvVH3T6o,73439,75360,become a yearly challenge eating the
ItxIvVH3T6o,75360,77759,entirety of a christmas tree you see i
ItxIvVH3T6o,77759,79360,hate seeing dead trees left on the curb
ItxIvVH3T6o,79360,80799,at the end of the holiday season not
ItxIvVH3T6o,80799,82240,only is it a depressing way to end the
ItxIvVH3T6o,82240,84479,season lights but it's also just a waste
ItxIvVH3T6o,84479,87200,of trees like you cut it down for what a
ItxIvVH3T6o,87200,89759,month of festive joy it's not enough if
ItxIvVH3T6o,89759,91520,you're sacrificing the tree well then
ItxIvVH3T6o,91520,93439,let's put it to use and since i'm no
ItxIvVH3T6o,93439,95280,ancient egyptian papyrus expert the only
ItxIvVH3T6o,95280,96799,thing i can think of is eating that
ItxIvVH3T6o,96799,98960,thing but as i proved last year eating
ItxIvVH3T6o,98960,100799,each individual part of the tree while
ItxIvVH3T6o,100799,103680,possible is not necessarily pleasant but
ItxIvVH3T6o,103680,105920,what if what if there were a way of
ItxIvVH3T6o,105920,107840,disguising that tree inside of something
ItxIvVH3T6o,107840,110159,else something a bit sweeter something
ItxIvVH3T6o,110159,113119,delicious something festive something
ItxIvVH3T6o,113119,116399,like say a christmas cookie one year ago
ItxIvVH3T6o,116399,119680,almost to the day we had a crazy idea we
ItxIvVH3T6o,119680,121600,learned that christmas trees are
ItxIvVH3T6o,121600,123920,actually non-toxic well
ItxIvVH3T6o,123920,126079,not all christmas trees just some
ItxIvVH3T6o,126079,128479,christmas trees but hey there's a
ItxIvVH3T6o,128479,130720,possibility of you being able to eat the
ItxIvVH3T6o,130720,132640,entirety of your christmas trees all the
ItxIvVH3T6o,132640,134319,way down the line instead of throwing it
ItxIvVH3T6o,134319,135360,out to the curb you could eat your
ItxIvVH3T6o,135360,137120,christmas tree so we decided to do that
ItxIvVH3T6o,137120,138720,and then we decided that just because
ItxIvVH3T6o,138720,140400,you can do something you probably
ItxIvVH3T6o,140400,142800,shouldn't necessarily do it because it
ItxIvVH3T6o,142800,145200,was the worst and just like that my
ItxIvVH3T6o,145200,147040,dreams of consuming my entire christmas
ItxIvVH3T6o,147040,149360,tree were gone at least until earlier
ItxIvVH3T6o,149360,151360,this year that is when i saw a video
ItxIvVH3T6o,151360,153760,from william osman and idubbbz in which
ItxIvVH3T6o,153760,156319,they tried to sneak as much sawdust as
ItxIvVH3T6o,156319,158959,they could inside of rice krispie treats
ItxIvVH3T6o,158959,160720,in fact i think they discovered that you
ItxIvVH3T6o,160720,163120,could get around a third of the crispy
ItxIvVH3T6o,163120,165599,treat swapped out for sawdust and so i
ItxIvVH3T6o,165599,168000,was like aha my dream of being able to
ItxIvVH3T6o,168000,170239,eat my entire christmas tree lives again
ItxIvVH3T6o,170239,171599,what if we sneak it into christmas
ItxIvVH3T6o,171599,173440,cookies those things are really sweet
ItxIvVH3T6o,173440,174720,there's a lot of places that you could
ItxIvVH3T6o,174720,177360,hide sawdust there what if i grind up a
ItxIvVH3T6o,177360,179760,christmas tree and consume it that way
ItxIvVH3T6o,179760,181519,so that my friends is the crazy
ItxIvVH3T6o,181519,184800,experiment that we're on today round two
ItxIvVH3T6o,184800,186319,eating it the traditional way didn't
ItxIvVH3T6o,186319,188560,work so what if we sneak it into a whole
ItxIvVH3T6o,188560,190879,bunch of cookies question number one how
ItxIvVH3T6o,190879,192800,much sawdust can we get away with inside
ItxIvVH3T6o,192800,194720,of our christmas cookies and question
ItxIvVH3T6o,194720,197040,number two if we're able to do that how
ItxIvVH3T6o,197040,198879,many christmas cookies would we need to
ItxIvVH3T6o,198879,201280,consume in order to eat the entire
ItxIvVH3T6o,201280,204319,christmas tree is it a dumb idea
ItxIvVH3T6o,204319,206640,yes but it was also dumb the first time
ItxIvVH3T6o,206640,208560,i feel like this one might be less dumb
ItxIvVH3T6o,208560,212239,in fact i predict my hypothesis my food
ItxIvVH3T6o,212239,214400,hypothesis is that this one is actually
ItxIvVH3T6o,214400,216560,going to be tastier than last year maybe
ItxIvVH3T6o,216560,218480,by year three will actually determine
ItxIvVH3T6o,218480,220560,something that's actually edible so
ItxIvVH3T6o,220560,221840,first things first let's actually talk
ItxIvVH3T6o,221840,223440,about the sawdust that we're using here
ItxIvVH3T6o,223440,225519,which likes to brand itself as wood
ItxIvVH3T6o,225519,226640,flour
ItxIvVH3T6o,226640,228480,but it's actually a fine sawdust that's
ItxIvVH3T6o,228480,230400,been filtered in order to eliminate all
ItxIvVH3T6o,230400,232560,those lumps you know because when you're
ItxIvVH3T6o,232560,234560,baking with sawdust you don't want those
ItxIvVH3T6o,234560,235840,lumps in there it's not like mashed
ItxIvVH3T6o,235840,237680,potatoes or anything so this actually
ItxIvVH3T6o,237680,239519,isn't me going out and grinding up my
ItxIvVH3T6o,239519,240720,own christmas tree this is actually the
ItxIvVH3T6o,240720,242080,same stuff that william osman and
ItxIvVH3T6o,242080,244560,idubbbz used for their video and when
ItxIvVH3T6o,244560,245760,you open it up it's actually really
ItxIvVH3T6o,245760,248480,interesting the the texture of it is
ItxIvVH3T6o,248480,250879,actually incredibly soft it does feel
ItxIvVH3T6o,250879,254000,like a fine powder similar to like a
ItxIvVH3T6o,254000,255120,flower
ItxIvVH3T6o,255120,256959,it's a little bit grainier like as i'm
ItxIvVH3T6o,256959,258400,digging around in it it's kind of
ItxIvVH3T6o,258400,260479,sticking to itself a bit
ItxIvVH3T6o,260479,262320,flour usually kind of shifts around so
ItxIvVH3T6o,262320,264720,it does feel slightly different but for
ItxIvVH3T6o,264720,266400,the most part almost totally
ItxIvVH3T6o,266400,268400,interchangeable with flour it's also
ItxIvVH3T6o,268400,271360,worth noting that this should be okay to
ItxIvVH3T6o,271360,274240,consume they do say avoid breathing dust
ItxIvVH3T6o,274240,275840,you can consume it but just don't
ItxIvVH3T6o,275840,277919,breathe in the dust of it so first
ItxIvVH3T6o,277919,279520,things first we have to determine how
ItxIvVH3T6o,279520,281759,much sawdust is too much sawdust for
ItxIvVH3T6o,281759,283360,your christmas cookie at which point
ItxIvVH3T6o,283360,286479,does it feel decidedly less festive to
ItxIvVH3T6o,286479,288400,eat we're gonna start with just four
ItxIvVH3T6o,288400,290960,ounces of basic sugar cookie dough easy
ItxIvVH3T6o,290960,293120,standard it should be delicious from
ItxIvVH3T6o,293120,294639,there we're gonna mix in various
ItxIvVH3T6o,294639,297360,percentages of sawdust to see at which
ItxIvVH3T6o,297360,299600,point does the cookie start to become
ItxIvVH3T6o,299600,302080,a little bit more questionable and then
ItxIvVH3T6o,302080,304160,on top of that we're gonna figure out if
ItxIvVH3T6o,304160,306080,we can mix some sawdust into the icing
ItxIvVH3T6o,306080,307680,as well because that's another place
ItxIvVH3T6o,307680,309440,that we can hide this stuff so without
ItxIvVH3T6o,309440,311440,any further ado let's start mixing some
ItxIvVH3T6o,311440,312880,dough first off we're going to measure
ItxIvVH3T6o,312880,314080,out this dough
ItxIvVH3T6o,314080,316800,for perfect 100 dough should be
ItxIvVH3T6o,316800,319199,delicious this is our control group so
ItxIvVH3T6o,319199,320800,we've got our control next thing we're
ItxIvVH3T6o,320800,323360,going to do is mix in various amounts of
ItxIvVH3T6o,323360,324880,sawdust to get us our various
ItxIvVH3T6o,324880,327360,percentages so first we're going to do
ItxIvVH3T6o,327360,329440,0.4 ounces
ItxIvVH3T6o,329440,331120,of sawdust and then we're going to mix
ItxIvVH3T6o,331120,333840,that in with 3.6
ItxIvVH3T6o,333840,336080,ounces of the cookie dough which in
ItxIvVH3T6o,336080,338400,total should get us up to
ItxIvVH3T6o,338400,339360,10
ItxIvVH3T6o,339360,341360,of the cookie and we're doing this by
ItxIvVH3T6o,341360,343520,weight since things are gonna change a
ItxIvVH3T6o,343520,345840,little bit when we actually bake them so
ItxIvVH3T6o,345840,347440,point four ounces of sawdust going right
ItxIvVH3T6o,347440,348639,in the bowl
ItxIvVH3T6o,348639,350880,now we're gonna mix it in with
ItxIvVH3T6o,350880,353840,our three six ounces
ItxIvVH3T6o,353840,355520,of cookie dough and that should give us
ItxIvVH3T6o,355520,356560,our 10
ItxIvVH3T6o,356560,358160,sawdust cookie
ItxIvVH3T6o,358160,360479,exciting times and then we're just going
ItxIvVH3T6o,360479,361759,to do that over and over again at
ItxIvVH3T6o,361759,363680,different percentages which we will show
ItxIvVH3T6o,363680,365600,you on screen right now isn't that right
ItxIvVH3T6o,365600,367680,editors oh my gosh there's no way that
ItxIvVH3T6o,367680,369199,we're getting yeah this does not look
ItxIvVH3T6o,369199,371280,appetizing at all and this is only 10
ItxIvVH3T6o,371280,375600,i'm very concerned about this this is 10
ItxIvVH3T6o,378240,380720,so um this
ItxIvVH3T6o,380720,382880,is not working at all kind of makes
ItxIvVH3T6o,382880,384160,sense if i had stepped back and thought
ItxIvVH3T6o,384160,385840,about this before i started putting on
ItxIvVH3T6o,385840,388080,the cameras because we're already
ItxIvVH3T6o,388080,390080,dealing with dough by using that i'm
ItxIvVH3T6o,390080,392240,already using pre-made dough so i'm just
ItxIvVH3T6o,392240,394800,trying to mix in more flour in this case
ItxIvVH3T6o,394800,396720,sawdust flour mix in more flour into
ItxIvVH3T6o,396720,397919,something that already has the
ItxIvVH3T6o,397919,399680,appropriate amount of flour in it so i'm
ItxIvVH3T6o,399680,401440,just adding more to the mix thereby
ItxIvVH3T6o,401440,403199,making it drier so i guess i just have
ItxIvVH3T6o,403199,404479,to make dough from scratch and instead
ItxIvVH3T6o,404479,405919,of incorporating flour into something
ItxIvVH3T6o,405919,408240,that already exists instead using this
ItxIvVH3T6o,408240,410960,as a flower alternative and mixing it in
ItxIvVH3T6o,410960,412720,in various amounts to achieve those
ItxIvVH3T6o,412720,413919,percentages that we were talking about
ItxIvVH3T6o,413919,416560,before so catchy on the other side and
ItxIvVH3T6o,416560,418560,we're back after considering our life
ItxIvVH3T6o,418560,420800,choices so the problem with the original
ItxIvVH3T6o,420800,422880,dough plan was that the dough was
ItxIvVH3T6o,422880,425199,already made so all the requisite flour
ItxIvVH3T6o,425199,427440,for that dough was already mixed in if
ItxIvVH3T6o,427440,429199,we want the sawdust to actually serve as
ItxIvVH3T6o,429199,431360,a flour replacement we have to go back
ItxIvVH3T6o,431360,434240,to scratch so we found a sugar cookie
ItxIvVH3T6o,434240,436080,recipe that calls for one and a half
ItxIvVH3T6o,436080,438880,cups of flour so this is going to be our
ItxIvVH3T6o,438880,440720,control from here though we're going to
ItxIvVH3T6o,440720,442880,make other doughs that are mixing in
ItxIvVH3T6o,442880,445039,sawdust to replace certain amounts of
ItxIvVH3T6o,445039,449520,the flour 10 20 30 etc by weight so
ItxIvVH3T6o,449520,452560,weighing this in it came in at 228 grams
ItxIvVH3T6o,452560,454319,for a cup and a half of flour so what
ItxIvVH3T6o,454319,457599,we're going to do is take 22.8
ItxIvVH3T6o,457599,460720,grams of sawdust which is 10
ItxIvVH3T6o,460720,463120,of that amount mix it in add the rest
ItxIvVH3T6o,463120,465440,into flour and boom that's your 10
ItxIvVH3T6o,465440,467759,cookie and so on and so forth show up
ItxIvVH3T6o,467759,470000,the chart editors
ItxIvVH3T6o,470000,472879,boom it's gonna appear right here
ItxIvVH3T6o,472879,475120,and now it's gonna move over here
ItxIvVH3T6o,475120,476960,now it's gonna move right in the middle
ItxIvVH3T6o,476960,478639,there it is there's your math
ItxIvVH3T6o,478639,480000,hopefully they did everything that i
ItxIvVH3T6o,480000,481599,just asked them to do
ItxIvVH3T6o,481599,483199,knowing the editors they didn't do that
ItxIvVH3T6o,483199,487039,so we're doing 22.8 grams of sawdust to
ItxIvVH3T6o,487039,489599,replace in the flour that'll give us our
ItxIvVH3T6o,489599,492879,10 cookie here 22.7 okay so this my
ItxIvVH3T6o,492879,496639,friends is our 10 cookie 228 grams mixed
ItxIvVH3T6o,496639,499440,in here of flour and sawdust 10 made of
ItxIvVH3T6o,499440,501120,sawdust so now
ItxIvVH3T6o,501120,504479,we're gonna do it 20 30 40 50
ItxIvVH3T6o,504479,506879,cue the montage i don't have much
ItxIvVH3T6o,506879,509360,footage of me doing the flower
ItxIvVH3T6o,509360,510879,matt's saying don't queue any montage
ItxIvVH3T6o,510879,514479,because that footage doesn't exist so um
ItxIvVH3T6o,514479,517120,cue the transition so we've measured out
ItxIvVH3T6o,517120,519518,all our sawdust flower combinations here
ItxIvVH3T6o,519518,522399,and i gotta say initial observation i'm
ItxIvVH3T6o,522399,524000,concerned about the stability of these
ItxIvVH3T6o,524000,526080,cookies take for instance the 50 mix
ItxIvVH3T6o,526080,528399,here what you immediately notice is the
ItxIvVH3T6o,528399,530320,huge amount of volume of sawdust
ItxIvVH3T6o,530320,532800,relative to the little amount of flour
ItxIvVH3T6o,532800,535839,this is a 50 50 mix of flour to sawdust
ItxIvVH3T6o,535839,537920,by weight the important thing there is
ItxIvVH3T6o,537920,540399,that the sawdust is so much less dense
ItxIvVH3T6o,540399,542880,than the flour it is so much lighter as
ItxIvVH3T6o,542880,545519,a result you need a lot more sawdust to
ItxIvVH3T6o,545519,546959,match the amount of flour that you're
ItxIvVH3T6o,546959,548720,putting in here i think that that's
ItxIvVH3T6o,548720,550560,gonna translate to some very unstable
ItxIvVH3T6o,550560,552800,and very crumbly cookies since flour is
ItxIvVH3T6o,552800,554160,you know the thing that's helping to
ItxIvVH3T6o,554160,556240,hold all this together and i don't think
ItxIvVH3T6o,556240,558000,sawdust is really gonna stand in for
ItxIvVH3T6o,558000,559600,that so
ItxIvVH3T6o,559600,561360,i don't know friends i would be
ItxIvVH3T6o,561360,563519,surprised to see if we get a solid
ItxIvVH3T6o,563519,567200,stable cookie beyond the 20 mark at this
ItxIvVH3T6o,567200,568880,point it's time to actually make all
ItxIvVH3T6o,568880,570959,these individual doughs which means you
ItxIvVH3T6o,570959,572320,know at this point we're just making a
ItxIvVH3T6o,572320,574320,regular sugar cookie dough so we got our
ItxIvVH3T6o,574320,576080,sugar we got our baking powder we got
ItxIvVH3T6o,576080,578240,our milk egg vanilla all that stuff
ItxIvVH3T6o,578240,579760,everything else is gonna be running as
ItxIvVH3T6o,579760,582240,normal the only variable here is the
ItxIvVH3T6o,582240,583760,amount of sawdust in the flour mixture
ItxIvVH3T6o,583760,585120,so we're gonna run through this six
ItxIvVH3T6o,585120,587200,times just to get us started making some
ItxIvVH3T6o,587200,589360,basic cookie mix here so uh starting off
ItxIvVH3T6o,589360,592240,with our wet ingredients a half cup of
ItxIvVH3T6o,592240,595600,butter half cup that's the whole stick
ItxIvVH3T6o,595600,598320,no wonder everyone loves cookies so much
ItxIvVH3T6o,598320,600399,boom there it is whole thing in the pot
ItxIvVH3T6o,600399,605000,half cup of sugar and mix
ItxIvVH3T6o,606720,608800,all right doing a great job creaming in
ItxIvVH3T6o,608800,609920,there
ItxIvVH3T6o,609920,611279,matt is behind the camera being like
ItxIvVH3T6o,611279,613519,you're so stressful when you're cooking
ItxIvVH3T6o,613519,615839,and i so enlighten me what should i do
ItxIvVH3T6o,615839,616640,matt
ItxIvVH3T6o,616640,618640,everything differently everything
ItxIvVH3T6o,618640,620640,different why what what would i do well
ItxIvVH3T6o,620640,621760,first off the butter was supposed to be
ItxIvVH3T6o,621760,623839,softened and this is hard as a rock it's
ItxIvVH3T6o,623839,625680,the energy that you bring to the kitchen
ItxIvVH3T6o,625680,628000,it's the energy that i bring what that i
ItxIvVH3T6o,628000,630160,want things to work it's a stressful day
ItxIvVH3T6o,630160,634639,matt okay leave me alone
ItxIvVH3T6o,634800,637120,in my aggressive baking i dropped a
ItxIvVH3T6o,637120,639120,giant globule of butter sugar on the
ItxIvVH3T6o,639120,640320,floor
ItxIvVH3T6o,640320,643120,five second rule it's fine next up with
ItxIvVH3T6o,643120,645279,stressful times cooking with matpat
ItxIvVH3T6o,645279,647920,we're adding in our flour and sawdust
ItxIvVH3T6o,647920,650000,mixture in gradually with our wet
ItxIvVH3T6o,650000,651440,ingredients over here all right so last
ItxIvVH3T6o,651440,652240,up
ItxIvVH3T6o,652240,655360,baking powder and salt that's that guy
ItxIvVH3T6o,655360,657519,and lastly we've got a little pinch of
ItxIvVH3T6o,657519,658560,salt
ItxIvVH3T6o,658560,661279,so this is our sawdust dough ten percent
ItxIvVH3T6o,661279,663200,it's a little bit drier than i think a
ItxIvVH3T6o,663200,665120,normal sugar cookie dough would be but
ItxIvVH3T6o,665120,667200,not by too much and that could just be
ItxIvVH3T6o,667200,668800,my imagination because i know what's in
ItxIvVH3T6o,668800,670880,here there's raw egg in this i'm not
ItxIvVH3T6o,670880,672800,so supposed to eat it but i like to live
ItxIvVH3T6o,672800,675839,on the edge so
ItxIvVH3T6o,678240,681120,i don't know if it's just my imagination
ItxIvVH3T6o,681120,682160,tastes like i'm eating a little bit of
ItxIvVH3T6o,682160,683040,wood
ItxIvVH3T6o,683040,684800,definitely feels like i'm like
ItxIvVH3T6o,684800,686399,eating a cookie and then chewing on a
ItxIvVH3T6o,686399,688320,toothpick i'm also noticing that
ItxIvVH3T6o,688320,690320,immediately you can tell that there is a
ItxIvVH3T6o,690320,692399,browner color than than kind of you
ItxIvVH3T6o,692399,693760,would associate with a normal
ItxIvVH3T6o,693760,695839,traditional sugar cookie so the sawdust
ItxIvVH3T6o,695839,698160,is already making itself known even
ItxIvVH3T6o,698160,700160,though it's only at 10 interestingly
ItxIvVH3T6o,700160,701279,enough though
ItxIvVH3T6o,701279,703279,you know still very good consistency
ItxIvVH3T6o,703279,706000,still a great dough i'd be able to make
ItxIvVH3T6o,706000,707839,this into a cookie no problem so from a
ItxIvVH3T6o,707839,710399,consistency standpoint that feels about
ItxIvVH3T6o,710399,713279,the same but from a flavor standpoint
ItxIvVH3T6o,713279,715040,you might be able to tell already that's
ItxIvVH3T6o,715040,716320,one of the reasons why stephanie has to
ItxIvVH3T6o,716320,718160,stay a neutral observer in this little
ItxIvVH3T6o,718160,720000,experiment because she doesn't know
ItxIvVH3T6o,720000,721839,what's coming to her she thinks there's
ItxIvVH3T6o,721839,723440,just gonna be a bunch of christmas joy
ItxIvVH3T6o,723440,725120,headed her way
ItxIvVH3T6o,725120,726800,little does she know that she's gonna be
ItxIvVH3T6o,726800,728880,munching on a two by four our does are
ItxIvVH3T6o,728880,730560,all made and immediately you can start
ItxIvVH3T6o,730560,732240,to tell a couple differences here my
ItxIvVH3T6o,732240,734480,friends first and foremost hey when you
ItxIvVH3T6o,734480,736320,don't have any sawdust in your cookie
ItxIvVH3T6o,736320,739519,dough it looks normal it tastes normal
ItxIvVH3T6o,739519,742959,it behaves normally on the other end of
ItxIvVH3T6o,742959,748240,that spectrum you got wow at 30 sawdust
ItxIvVH3T6o,748240,751040,you got basically sand in a bag and then
ItxIvVH3T6o,751040,752560,40
ItxIvVH3T6o,752560,754959,is still in saran wrap for a reason
ItxIvVH3T6o,754959,756480,because as soon as i open this thing up
ItxIvVH3T6o,756480,758720,it's tumbling everywhere we didn't even
ItxIvVH3T6o,758720,760240,try with 50
ItxIvVH3T6o,760240,763440,let's be honest 50 is still 50 in the
ItxIvVH3T6o,763440,765600,bowl and that's where it's gonna stay so
ItxIvVH3T6o,765600,767839,there really does seem to be a critical
ItxIvVH3T6o,767839,770959,differentiator here between 20 sawdust
ItxIvVH3T6o,770959,774160,and 30 sawdust and immediately as we
ItxIvVH3T6o,774160,775519,were mixing it up you could tell that
ItxIvVH3T6o,775519,777760,the sawdust was just absorbing the
ItxIvVH3T6o,777760,779600,liquids that we were putting into it so
ItxIvVH3T6o,779600,781839,much faster and so much more completely
ItxIvVH3T6o,781839,784160,that it wasn't able to adhere as a dough
ItxIvVH3T6o,784160,786399,so it seems like 20 is gonna be our
ItxIvVH3T6o,786399,788560,sweet spot here but to know for sure we
ItxIvVH3T6o,788560,790240,gotta bake them up which means rolling
ItxIvVH3T6o,790240,792480,them out and cutting out
ItxIvVH3T6o,792480,793920,in true form
ItxIvVH3T6o,793920,795760,christmas trees look
ItxIvVH3T6o,795760,797279,based on the coloring of this you would
ItxIvVH3T6o,797279,798560,think that this is a delightful
ItxIvVH3T6o,798560,800560,gingerbread like i see this and i'm like
ItxIvVH3T6o,800560,803600,ooh it's a nice soft gingerbread boom
ItxIvVH3T6o,803600,805519,like that
ItxIvVH3T6o,805519,807440,you know how when you go to like home
ItxIvVH3T6o,807440,808959,depot or something to choose a color of
ItxIvVH3T6o,808959,810399,paint you get those color swatches of
ItxIvVH3T6o,810399,812639,like well here's the light brown option
ItxIvVH3T6o,812639,814240,here's the darker brown option and
ItxIvVH3T6o,814240,816480,here's the black option i feel like this
ItxIvVH3T6o,816480,818959,is the same way here's the light brown
ItxIvVH3T6o,818959,820320,here's the dark brown and here's the
ItxIvVH3T6o,820320,822880,black so there you go friends
ItxIvVH3T6o,822880,824959,probably in that order of flavor as well
ItxIvVH3T6o,824959,826839,here's 30
ItxIvVH3T6o,826839,829600,mm like playing with less enjoyable
ItxIvVH3T6o,829600,831839,kinetic sand maybe we'll get a cookie
ItxIvVH3T6o,831839,834320,out of this maybe we can squeeze out two
ItxIvVH3T6o,834320,838320,do we have a cookie we do
ItxIvVH3T6o,839120,841199,all right all right you're going to make
ItxIvVH3T6o,841199,844160,something out of it do we dare spit in
ItxIvVH3T6o,844160,846480,the face of the gods and tempt fate and
ItxIvVH3T6o,846480,848000,say you know what we're going to make a
ItxIvVH3T6o,848000,852160,40 cookie can we do it
ItxIvVH3T6o,854800,856480,look get my maybe if i squeeze it really
ItxIvVH3T6o,856480,857420,hard
ItxIvVH3T6o,857420,858800,[Music]
ItxIvVH3T6o,858800,861680,oh it does stick together slightly
ItxIvVH3T6o,861680,864399,look ah look it you can create a ball
ItxIvVH3T6o,864399,869000,out of it a little sawdust ball
ItxIvVH3T6o,871279,873600,so we're down to our final three you are
ItxIvVH3T6o,873600,876160,the three you are our last great hope
ItxIvVH3T6o,876160,878959,so miraculously we managed to get some
ItxIvVH3T6o,878959,880880,cookies out of all these doughs
ItxIvVH3T6o,880880,883360,obviously the less sawdust was a lot
ItxIvVH3T6o,883360,886480,easier but even over in 30 sawdust land
ItxIvVH3T6o,886480,888560,we got something that vaguely resembles
ItxIvVH3T6o,888560,891040,a put together solid thick christmas
ItxIvVH3T6o,891040,892560,cookies so
ItxIvVH3T6o,892560,894800,into the oven they go and we'll see what
ItxIvVH3T6o,894800,896399,comes out alright so i just pulled the
ItxIvVH3T6o,896399,898480,cookies out of the oven and i gotta say
ItxIvVH3T6o,898480,900880,what looked a little bit sketchy in
ItxIvVH3T6o,900880,903600,dough form is actually looking really
ItxIvVH3T6o,903600,905120,passable now that everything's fully
ItxIvVH3T6o,905120,907279,cooked so at this point we just need our
ItxIvVH3T6o,907279,909519,neutral observer to give us her verdict
ItxIvVH3T6o,909519,912160,so i'm going to label these uh one to
ItxIvVH3T6o,912160,913920,four so that way i can know which ones
ItxIvVH3T6o,913920,915360,are which and which ones correspond to
ItxIvVH3T6o,915360,917279,which amount of sawdust and then from
ItxIvVH3T6o,917279,919760,there we'll get a stephanie's
ItxIvVH3T6o,919760,922079,objective opinion as to how they taste
ItxIvVH3T6o,922079,924880,so my cookies are all prepared time to
ItxIvVH3T6o,924880,926480,get our objective taste test from
ItxIvVH3T6o,926480,929120,stephanie steph you busy
ItxIvVH3T6o,929120,930880,oh what's up

ItxIvVH3T6o,1042880,1044640,gingerbread ginger snap that's where you

ItxIvVH3T6o,1062000,1064400,okay ish good but it's much less sweet
ItxIvVH3T6o,1064400,1065840,than like this one i don't get any of
ItxIvVH3T6o,1065840,1067280,the butter at all and then like the
ItxIvVH3T6o,1067280,1069600,first few bites it was fine
ItxIvVH3T6o,1069600,1071679,what is this no i don't know
ItxIvVH3T6o,1071679,1073200,matt what is this cookie i'm getting an
ItxIvVH3T6o,1073200,1075120,uncomfortable feeling in my mouth it's
ItxIvVH3T6o,1075120,1076000,kind of
ItxIvVH3T6o,1076000,1078480,kind of gritty oh interesting it sits on
ItxIvVH3T6o,1078480,1080320,the back of my tongue in a weird way
ItxIvVH3T6o,1080320,1082559,what's in this cookie
ItxIvVH3T6o,1082559,1084880,i mean it's the bark you put the bark in
ItxIvVH3T6o,1084880,1088400,or something dumb oh it's sawdust
ItxIvVH3T6o,1088400,1091039,it's it's literal sawdust
ItxIvVH3T6o,1091039,1094400,i mean it's what cussing out how much of
ItxIvVH3T6o,1094400,1095520,a tree
ItxIvVH3T6o,1095520,1098320,you can put into a cookie
ItxIvVH3T6o,1098320,1100240,to try and eat your christmas cookie
ItxIvVH3T6o,1100240,1103039,there's sawdust in this how much sawdust
ItxIvVH3T6o,1103039,1106320,is in here is this whole thing oh 30 by
ItxIvVH3T6o,1106320,1107550,weight
ItxIvVH3T6o,1107550,1110960,[Laughter]
ItxIvVH3T6o,1110960,1112400,30
ItxIvVH3T6o,1112400,1114720,oh god no wonder i feel sick i feel like
ItxIvVH3T6o,1114720,1117440,no no it's fine it's edible sawdust it's
ItxIvVH3T6o,1117440,1120000,fine it's non-toxic totally safe
ItxIvVH3T6o,1120000,1122080,for wood glue i do want to try one last
ItxIvVH3T6o,1122080,1124240,thing though because a naked christmas
ItxIvVH3T6o,1124240,1125280,cookie
ItxIvVH3T6o,1125280,1127120,is not the greatest right so you're
ItxIvVH3T6o,1127120,1128880,saying that the flavor started to really
ItxIvVH3T6o,1128880,1131440,decline around the 20 to 30 mark right
ItxIvVH3T6o,1131440,1134960,so what i'd love to try is if we did 30
ItxIvVH3T6o,1134960,1138880,i'm not tasting that again if we did 20
ItxIvVH3T6o,1138880,1140480,but with icing
ItxIvVH3T6o,1140480,1142000,seasonal holiday icing and then you
ItxIvVH3T6o,1142000,1144160,could tell me does the icing actually
ItxIvVH3T6o,1144160,1148160,cover up the flavor of the sawdust
ItxIvVH3T6o,1148559,1152320,this one is softer the softer bake
ItxIvVH3T6o,1152320,1153919,i can't believe i was like complimenting
ItxIvVH3T6o,1153919,1155520,the way that these were cooked the
ItxIvVH3T6o,1155520,1156720,texture you can't cover up with the
ItxIvVH3T6o,1156720,1159039,icing yeah but the flavor hands down
ItxIvVH3T6o,1159039,1160960,easy the flavor is almost exactly the
ItxIvVH3T6o,1160960,1162240,same as this one and i think it would be
ItxIvVH3T6o,1162240,1163600,almost exactly as the same as the
ItxIvVH3T6o,1163600,1165760,control 2. knowing that we can get away
ItxIvVH3T6o,1165760,1168240,with about 44 grams of sawdust in a
ItxIvVH3T6o,1168240,1170480,typical batch of cookie dough here the
ItxIvVH3T6o,1170480,1172799,question now remains
ItxIvVH3T6o,1172799,1174160,how many cookies do we need to eat in
ItxIvVH3T6o,1174160,1176240,order to consume the entirety of the
ItxIvVH3T6o,1176240,1178960,christmas tree stuff oh boy just one
ItxIvVH3T6o,1178960,1180640,cookie at a time that sounds like a
ItxIvVH3T6o,1180640,1184160,question for vo vo matpat do that
ItxIvVH3T6o,1184160,1186000,calculation and take it home happy to
ItxIvVH3T6o,1186000,1187919,take it from there past matpat so as we
ItxIvVH3T6o,1187919,1189919,mentioned earlier there were 228 grams
ItxIvVH3T6o,1189919,1191840,of flour in the dough recipe and we
ItxIvVH3T6o,1191840,1194160,settled on the 20 sawdust cookie as the
ItxIvVH3T6o,1194160,1196320,acceptable amount of wood inside our
ItxIvVH3T6o,1196320,1198960,dessert which meant 45.6 grams of
ItxIvVH3T6o,1198960,1201120,sawdust in each batch now a typical
ItxIvVH3T6o,1201120,1203280,christmas tree weighs in at about 59
ItxIvVH3T6o,1203280,1205240,pounds or 26
ItxIvVH3T6o,1205240,1208080,762 grams so dividing that by the amount
ItxIvVH3T6o,1208080,1209600,of sawdust we're using in each dough
ItxIvVH3T6o,1209600,1211320,gives us
ItxIvVH3T6o,1211320,1215120,587 which is a lot of cookies to eat in
ItxIvVH3T6o,1215120,1216720,order to consume an entire christmas
ItxIvVH3T6o,1216720,1218480,tree but remember that's not the amount
ItxIvVH3T6o,1218480,1220799,of cookies that's the amount of batches
ItxIvVH3T6o,1220799,1222799,of cookies each glob of dough is going
ItxIvVH3T6o,1222799,1224880,to make you about 18 cookies which means
ItxIvVH3T6o,1224880,1226559,that to eat an entire christmas tree
ItxIvVH3T6o,1226559,1228640,you're not looking at 500 cookies you're
ItxIvVH3T6o,1228640,1230559,looking at 10
ItxIvVH3T6o,1230559,1232799,500 specifically 10
ItxIvVH3T6o,1232799,1234640,560
ItxIvVH3T6o,1234640,1236480,that is uh not gonna jive well with the
ItxIvVH3T6o,1236480,1238640,whole new year's diet statistics say an
ItxIvVH3T6o,1238640,1240559,average person will eat 300 cookies in a
ItxIvVH3T6o,1240559,1241760,year to get through that tree we're
ItxIvVH3T6o,1241760,1244720,talking 35 times that amount in short if
ItxIvVH3T6o,1244720,1245679,you wanted to get through the whole
ItxIvVH3T6o,1245679,1247520,thing by the end of january you need to
ItxIvVH3T6o,1247520,1248679,be eating about
ItxIvVH3T6o,1248679,1252159,341 cookies per day but alright i'm in
ItxIvVH3T6o,1252159,1254080,it for the long term i can be patient as
