6-aGt23ytyI,100,3010,- Have you ever tried to skydive into a plane?
6-aGt23ytyI,3010,4100,- I've never skydived.
6-aGt23ytyI,4100,5960,- What about arm wrestling a bear
6-aGt23ytyI,5960,8120,or reenacting medieval warfare.
6-aGt23ytyI,8120,8953,- What?
6-aGt23ytyI,8953,9786,- We're gonna be reacting
6-aGt23ytyI,9786,11820,to the most extreme sports on the planet.
6-aGt23ytyI,11820,12960,Bear arm wrestling.
6-aGt23ytyI,12960,15750,"- Wait it's a bear arm wrestling, a bare arm."
6-aGt23ytyI,15750,16690,"- I'm gonna be honest,"
6-aGt23ytyI,16690,19350,I'm not sold that this is a real bear.
6-aGt23ytyI,19350,21180,"- What do you think it's like that SpongeBob episode,"
6-aGt23ytyI,21180,23500,where it's like the gorilla suit and he zip sit down.
6-aGt23ytyI,23500,25810,- There's no way you actually arm wrestle a bear
6-aGt23ytyI,25810,26920,and you're just chill about it.
6-aGt23ytyI,26920,28170,- Look how big his claws are.
6-aGt23ytyI,28170,29433,Them things is huge.
6-aGt23ytyI,30390,31223,"Oh, he beat him."
6-aGt23ytyI,31223,32640,"- Oh my gosh, that is a real bear."
6-aGt23ytyI,32640,34360,I thought it was some dude in a costume.
6-aGt23ytyI,34360,37730,These men just arm wrestled a legit bear.
6-aGt23ytyI,37730,39040,- Extreme sports
6-aGt23ytyI,39040,40080,Bo-taoshi!
6-aGt23ytyI,40080,41000,- This is Bo-taoshi.
6-aGt23ytyI,41000,43120,"In my limited knowledge, I've been told,"
6-aGt23ytyI,43120,45920,it's 150 people versus 150 other people.
6-aGt23ytyI,45920,46753,- Uh huh
6-aGt23ytyI,46753,47586,- And you have to like
6-aGt23ytyI,47586,48419,knock the guy off the top of the pole.
6-aGt23ytyI,48419,49840,- Okay. And there's a sea of people
6-aGt23ytyI,49840,51563,and everybody just kicks each other in the face.
6-aGt23ytyI,51563,53010,- They literally just fling each other at each other.
6-aGt23ytyI,53010,53843,- Looks safe.
6-aGt23ytyI,53843,55340,"- Now, if you thought that was extreme,"
6-aGt23ytyI,55340,57350,up next we got pillow fighting.
6-aGt23ytyI,57350,59969,"- When you said that, I thought it was gonna be a bunch"
6-aGt23ytyI,59970,62830,of people in a basement and not a real thing.
6-aGt23ytyI,62830,63663,This is legit.
6-aGt23ytyI,63663,65379,"There's cameramen, they've got a ring."
6-aGt23ytyI,65379,67140,"- Yeah, this is real professional pillow fighting."
6-aGt23ytyI,67140,68090,- I want to do this.
6-aGt23ytyI,68090,69439,PFC hit me up.
6-aGt23ytyI,69440,70570,I'm good at pillow fighting.
6-aGt23ytyI,70570,72147,How do they make sure nobody puts
6-aGt23ytyI,72147,74510,marbles in their pillow or anything.
6-aGt23ytyI,74510,76050,- I'm sure it doesn't take much time
6-aGt23ytyI,76050,78170,"for a judge to go, there's no marbles in here."
6-aGt23ytyI,78170,80629,- He didn't know about my little pouch I had underneath.
6-aGt23ytyI,80629,83577,- (laughter) I'm sure the ding against your head sound
6-aGt23ytyI,83578,84540,would give it away.
6-aGt23ytyI,84540,86480,- Why is that person bleeding from a pillow?
6-aGt23ytyI,86480,88280,- This is called reverse skydiving.
6-aGt23ytyI,88280,89113,Let's see what it's about.
6-aGt23ytyI,89113,91430,- So you start on a mountain and you wing suit off
6-aGt23ytyI,91430,93670,"and you have to have a guy with a plane,"
6-aGt23ytyI,93670,95990,open the door and they're gonna land in the plane?
6-aGt23ytyI,95990,97240,Shout out to Fred and Vince.
6-aGt23ytyI,97240,98259,They're doing this live.
6-aGt23ytyI,98260,100770,"- Let's be honest, what happens if you hit the propeller"
6-aGt23ytyI,100770,101765,"in the front of the plane,"
6-aGt23ytyI,101765,102598,- (buzzing)
6-aGt23ytyI,102598,103431,- A bee comes?
6-aGt23ytyI,103431,104409,"I'm asking what happens to them,"
6-aGt23ytyI,104410,105565,Not if a bee shows up.
6-aGt23ytyI,105565,106931,"- Oh, they turn into confetti."
6-aGt23ytyI,106931,108260,- Did they launch confetti?
6-aGt23ytyI,108260,109093,- Yeah.
6-aGt23ytyI,109093,110040,- But then what do they do after that?
6-aGt23ytyI,110040,111192,- You're gonna keep doing this bit
6-aGt23ytyI,111192,112025,- (laughter)
6-aGt23ytyI,112025,113322,"Bro. Wait, no way."
6-aGt23ytyI,113322,115040,"- No, that's insane."
6-aGt23ytyI,115040,117290,"Shout out to Vince, Vince really got it."
6-aGt23ytyI,117290,118780,- What if as you're coming in the door
6-aGt23ytyI,118780,121060,you just whack your head on the wing and then you just fall.
6-aGt23ytyI,121060,123420,- That would knock you out and then you just never wake up.
6-aGt23ytyI,123420,124869,- You'd wake up but be in heaven.
6-aGt23ytyI,124870,126100,"If you thought that was epic,"
6-aGt23ytyI,126100,127750,keep watching because later in this video
6-aGt23ytyI,127750,131530,there's a literal medieval war reenacted in a sport.
6-aGt23ytyI,131530,134300,- I guess I now have to watch all the way to the end.
6-aGt23ytyI,134300,136217,"- This is called Onbashiri, right?"
6-aGt23ytyI,136217,137049,- Onbashira.
6-aGt23ytyI,137050,139100,"- I'm gonna be honest, I don't fully understand it,"
6-aGt23ytyI,139100,140610,but apparently they have to get this log
6-aGt23ytyI,140610,141810,all the way down the mountain.
6-aGt23ytyI,141810,142840,And it shows bravery.
6-aGt23ytyI,142840,143730,"- I would say so,"
6-aGt23ytyI,143730,145890,people are getting like ran over by that log.
6-aGt23ytyI,145890,147630,"Oh, they're ridding the log down."
6-aGt23ytyI,147630,149980,"- Full send. Yo, this kinda reminds me of Vinland Saga."
6-aGt23ytyI,149980,151206,- You think that's how they used to
6-aGt23ytyI,151206,152970,get around back in the day?
6-aGt23ytyI,152970,154450,- Does not seem effective at all.
6-aGt23ytyI,154450,155282,"- I mean, there's nothing like chopping a tree down"
6-aGt23ytyI,155283,157570,"with the boys, hopping on it"
6-aGt23ytyI,157570,159450,and just log scooting down a hill
6-aGt23ytyI,159450,161530,- Tying giant robes lining up tons of people
6-aGt23ytyI,161530,162569,flinging it down a hill
6-aGt23ytyI,162570,164160,that would probably take two seconds to walk down.
6-aGt23ytyI,164160,166239,This next extreme sport is arguably my favorite.
6-aGt23ytyI,166239,167459,This is chess boxing.
6-aGt23ytyI,167460,168880,You start off with the game of chess.
6-aGt23ytyI,168880,170280,You both make some moves.
6-aGt23ytyI,170280,172150,"And then when the bell rings,"
6-aGt23ytyI,172150,173610,they pick up the chess board
6-aGt23ytyI,173610,175230,and then you start boxing each other.
6-aGt23ytyI,175230,178370,"- Got you. Okay, so it's like brains versus brawn."
6-aGt23ytyI,178370,179709,"And then in between it,"
6-aGt23ytyI,179710,182270,you have to be like he had his night at D3.
6-aGt23ytyI,182270,184160,That means I'm gonna need to castle
6-aGt23ytyI,184160,185840,and take my rook to B5.
6-aGt23ytyI,185840,187319,- So imagine your Magnus Carlsen
6-aGt23ytyI,187320,189720,and you just try to always win before the boxing happened.
6-aGt23ytyI,189720,191420,"Yo who wins in chess boxing,"
6-aGt23ytyI,191420,193709,"Magnus Carlsen, the greatest chess player to ever live"
6-aGt23ytyI,193710,196410,or Mike Tyson arguably one of the best boxers to ever live.
6-aGt23ytyI,196410,197527,- Logan Paul just pops up.
6-aGt23ytyI,197527,198489,"He's like, what'd you say?"
6-aGt23ytyI,198490,199840,- You're making a mockery of the sport
6-aGt23ytyI,199840,200780,and I don't appreciate it.
6-aGt23ytyI,200780,201689,- I'm not Logan.
6-aGt23ytyI,201689,204069,(laughter)
6-aGt23ytyI,204070,204903,I'm sorry.
6-aGt23ytyI,204903,206570,"I'm friends with Logan, I can say that now."
6-aGt23ytyI,206570,208090,- So this is called cheese running.
6-aGt23ytyI,208090,209849,"- You got me first word, cheese, done."
6-aGt23ytyI,209850,210683,- Oh my gosh.
6-aGt23ytyI,210683,211515,- That guy literally
6-aGt23ytyI,211516,212349,"- Yo, he's still going."
6-aGt23ytyI,212349,213200,- He yeeted his head into the ground
6-aGt23ytyI,213200,215340,- So first one down the hill gets the cheese.
6-aGt23ytyI,215340,216172,"I'm not gonna lie,"
6-aGt23ytyI,216173,217360,This does look like it would be fun.
6-aGt23ytyI,217360,220060,"- Yeah, until you get absolute annihilated"
6-aGt23ytyI,220060,221170,by the guy behind you
6-aGt23ytyI,221170,223870,"Isle of Man, it's a race at the Isle of Man."
6-aGt23ytyI,223870,225424,There's an Isle of Man?
6-aGt23ytyI,225425,227010,- It definitely looks extreme.
6-aGt23ytyI,227010,229633,- They're like getting mad air and the road's wet.
6-aGt23ytyI,229633,230480,- Bro
6-aGt23ytyI,230480,232217,"- Okay, there's no way you can process that"
6-aGt23ytyI,232217,235207,"- Bro yeah, you could not pay me to do this."
6-aGt23ytyI,235207,236040,- Oh
6-aGt23ytyI,237770,238603,- Oh. Oh
6-aGt23ytyI,239624,240456,- That sucks.
6-aGt23ytyI,240457,242580,- Imagine you're just crushing it.
6-aGt23ytyI,242580,243820,And then someone else gets in a wreck
6-aGt23ytyI,243820,244960,which gets you in a wreck.
6-aGt23ytyI,244960,246090,- Imagine dragons
6-aGt23ytyI,246090,247220,- These nuts over my face
6-aGt23ytyI,247220,248053,- The band
6-aGt23ytyI,248053,249470,"- Yo, hot air balloon warfare."
6-aGt23ytyI,249470,251083,"- It's not warfare, calm down."
6-aGt23ytyI,251083,252290,They're walking between - Aw
6-aGt23ytyI,252290,253340,"what do you mean, Aw?"
6-aGt23ytyI,253340,255690,This is the first extreme-treme sport.
6-aGt23ytyI,255690,259157,"Look, no lines nothing, you fall you're done."
6-aGt23ytyI,259157,260120,- [Rope Walker] Lit
6-aGt23ytyI,260120,261790,- Yo did someone just say lit
6-aGt23ytyI,261790,265200,"- Yo, that made this, which is the coolest thing ever."
6-aGt23ytyI,265200,266850,"Instantly, just uncool."
6-aGt23ytyI,266850,268070,- Honestly kind of ruined my vibe.
6-aGt23ytyI,268070,270190,"I was really vibing with it, but now like, eh."
6-aGt23ytyI,270190,271180,- They deserve to fall here.
6-aGt23ytyI,271180,272013,- Okay. Okay.
6-aGt23ytyI,272013,273300,As long as he falls
6-aGt23ytyI,273300,274159,"- Hey, there he goes"
6-aGt23ytyI,274160,275000,- Yo that's lit
6-aGt23ytyI,275000,277540,"- As he's falling he's like, yo, this is so lit."
6-aGt23ytyI,277540,280070,We gotta talk about those concrete grippers right there.
6-aGt23ytyI,280070,281613,Why he got him dogs out.
6-aGt23ytyI,281613,284780,- Look at the gap in between his big toe his middle toe.
6-aGt23ytyI,284780,287050,- Why your feet look like that dawg?
6-aGt23ytyI,287050,287930,"Oh, he's got an umbrella."
6-aGt23ytyI,287930,290530,"That'll make it so if he falls, he'll be fine right?"
6-aGt23ytyI,292570,293403,- Nope.
6-aGt23ytyI,293403,294400,Ice Cross Downhill.
6-aGt23ytyI,294400,296460,"- Oh, this is cool. This is actually"
6-aGt23ytyI,296460,297293,"- Wait, wait, wait."
6-aGt23ytyI,297293,298220,Let's go back to that crowd shot.
6-aGt23ytyI,298220,299630,"Oh, nevermind, I was gonna say,"
6-aGt23ytyI,299630,301560,see if you can find a single woman in the crowd
6-aGt23ytyI,301560,302730,but there's actually quite a few.
6-aGt23ytyI,302730,305160,You look at how happy this gentleman right here is.
6-aGt23ytyI,305160,306490,- This guy's just a god.
6-aGt23ytyI,306490,308139,He's probably in modeling now.
6-aGt23ytyI,308140,309426,This guy just wants to go home
6-aGt23ytyI,309426,312460,"- (giggle) Yo, these POV shots make it seem way scarier."
6-aGt23ytyI,312460,313293,- Yeah. Like this.
6-aGt23ytyI,313293,314810,Ooh
6-aGt23ytyI,314810,316370,- This is pro slapping.
6-aGt23ytyI,316370,317203,- Ooh.
6-aGt23ytyI,317203,318036,- Oh
6-aGt23ytyI,318036,319630,- Oh my goodness.
6-aGt23ytyI,319630,322240,Even he was shocked by his own slap.
6-aGt23ytyI,322240,324550,"He was like, oh crap I maybe shouldn't have done that."
6-aGt23ytyI,324550,325870,"- Wait, he doesn't get a slap back?"
6-aGt23ytyI,325870,328080,"- He would, if he was still conscious."
6-aGt23ytyI,328080,328919,- Wow.
6-aGt23ytyI,328920,332320,"- Oh my God, would you let that guy slap you?"
6-aGt23ytyI,332320,334430,But you get everything you've ever wanted in life.
6-aGt23ytyI,334430,335710,- Yeah of course slap me right now.
6-aGt23ytyI,335710,336543,"Not you, him."
6-aGt23ytyI,336543,337510,- You said it
6-aGt23ytyI,337510,340220,- Now it is time for medieval MMA.
6-aGt23ytyI,340220,342120,"Dana white, if you're watching take notes."
6-aGt23ytyI,342120,342953,Oh my gosh.
6-aGt23ytyI,342953,344790,- Okay. I really didn't expect it like that.
6-aGt23ytyI,344790,346260,"- Yo, I didn't know it was that brutal."
6-aGt23ytyI,346260,347093,- Holy crap.
6-aGt23ytyI,347093,348797,They're actually hitting each other with real weapons.
6-aGt23ytyI,348797,352360,- Yeah. So these guys have 70 to 80 pounds of armor on them.
6-aGt23ytyI,352360,354250,- I mean even if the blade's not sharp
6-aGt23ytyI,354250,357040,getting hit with a large piece of metal still hurts.
6-aGt23ytyI,357040,359260,- Literally no one here is arguing that this doesn't hurt.
6-aGt23ytyI,359260,361330,"- I'm not arguing, I'm reacting."
6-aGt23ytyI,361330,363110,"What do you want me to do, just stand in silence?"
6-aGt23ytyI,363110,364590,- Yeah just stand there and look cute.
6-aGt23ytyI,364590,366419,Bro. Yo. Oh my god.
6-aGt23ytyI,366420,367253,- Holy crap.
6-aGt23ytyI,367253,369643,"Yo, he looked like he costs five elixir, bro."
6-aGt23ytyI,370577,373169,Did you know that cows that live in a mountainous area
6-aGt23ytyI,373170,375530,their legs are longer on one side of their bodies.
6-aGt23ytyI,375530,376363,- Really?
6-aGt23ytyI,376363,379150,- No. It's just my favorite thing to do to people.
6-aGt23ytyI,379150,381790,- I'm having lower back pain and you still did that to me.
6-aGt23ytyI,381790,384640,"- If I hear about your lower back pain one more time,"
6-aGt23ytyI,384640,387680,"I'm gonna reset your spine, like SpongeBob style."
6-aGt23ytyI,387680,389960,"When Squidward was like ""my back""."
6-aGt23ytyI,389960,391750,Yo we also used to do this
6-aGt23ytyI,391750,393550,except for we still used a four wheeler.
6-aGt23ytyI,393550,394383,- I don't believe you
6-aGt23ytyI,394383,395620,- And we pulled sleds through the grass.
6-aGt23ytyI,395620,396780,- How about you pull some women
6-aGt23ytyI,396780,398437,"- You wanted to say the other word, but you can't"
6-aGt23ytyI,398437,400210,"- I did, We're family friendly."
6-aGt23ytyI,400210,401043,- Yeah.

6-aGt23ytyI,450050,451629,or some of the other sports but it's like
