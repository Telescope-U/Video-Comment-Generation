ca9tHTUK9z8,82190,94120,[Music]
ca9tHTUK9z8,94880,97040,good morning babes welcome back to
ca9tHTUK9z8,97040,99600,another video so i just finished my
ca9tHTUK9z8,99600,101600,little morning journal routine and
ca9tHTUK9z8,101600,103040,almost done my matcha we got a little
ca9tHTUK9z8,103040,104960,bit of a dribble left but today we are
ca9tHTUK9z8,104960,107439,doing a full self-care day full
ca9tHTUK9z8,107439,110560,self-care routine i guess day in my life
ca9tHTUK9z8,110560,112399,most of you will know or if you're in
ca9tHTUK9z8,112399,115280,ontario you obviously will know that we
ca9tHTUK9z8,115280,118640,are kind of in a modified lockdown so
ca9tHTUK9z8,118640,121280,gyms are closed indoor dining is closed
ca9tHTUK9z8,121280,123119,theaters are closed and i don't know
ca9tHTUK9z8,123119,125200,about you guys but for me personally all
ca9tHTUK9z8,125200,127520,the lockdowns and stuff really
ca9tHTUK9z8,127520,129920,put me into not the best mental state if
ca9tHTUK9z8,129920,131760,you watched one of my previous vlogs
ca9tHTUK9z8,131760,133840,back at the end of december you know it
ca9tHTUK9z8,133840,135920,kind of gives me a great amount of
ca9tHTUK9z8,135920,137840,anxiety and
ca9tHTUK9z8,137840,139599,yeah so i think it's really important to
ca9tHTUK9z8,139599,142160,prioritize self-care and well-being
ca9tHTUK9z8,142160,144720,prioritize your mental health during
ca9tHTUK9z8,144720,146800,these states of lockdown and whether
ca9tHTUK9z8,146800,148239,you're in lockdown or not it's always
ca9tHTUK9z8,148239,150080,important to prioritize your mental
ca9tHTUK9z8,150080,152000,being and your mental health but i know
ca9tHTUK9z8,152000,153519,for me when these lockdown situation
ca9tHTUK9z8,153519,154879,type things happen it's even more
ca9tHTUK9z8,154879,156160,important to do that so that's what
ca9tHTUK9z8,156160,157760,today is i thought we'd just go through
ca9tHTUK9z8,157760,159920,kind of some of the things that i do
ca9tHTUK9z8,159920,160879,to
ca9tHTUK9z8,160879,162640,help take care of me and help take care
ca9tHTUK9z8,162640,164720,of my mental well-being
ca9tHTUK9z8,164720,167200,and i hope this helps you guys or like
ca9tHTUK9z8,167200,169519,gives you some ideas of how to take care
ca9tHTUK9z8,169519,171360,of your mental well-being but like i
ca9tHTUK9z8,171360,172800,said i just did my little journal
ca9tHTUK9z8,172800,175200,routine since i've been home i've been
ca9tHTUK9z8,175200,176720,doing kind of a little bit of an
ca9tHTUK9z8,176720,178239,extended journal routine and i've been
ca9tHTUK9z8,178239,179920,loving it using my five minute journal
ca9tHTUK9z8,179920,182239,as always and then i've gotten back into
ca9tHTUK9z8,182239,185120,using my inside then out journal
ca9tHTUK9z8,185120,186959,basically it's got a little prompt at
ca9tHTUK9z8,186959,188560,the top and then it's just a little bit
ca9tHTUK9z8,188560,190000,more of an extended journal whereas the
ca9tHTUK9z8,190000,191360,five-minute journal is just straight
ca9tHTUK9z8,191360,193360,gratitude so they're both a little bit
ca9tHTUK9z8,193360,194879,different and then of course doing my
ca9tHTUK9z8,194879,196800,daily devotions i got a new one over the
ca9tHTUK9z8,196800,198480,christmas break
ca9tHTUK9z8,198480,201360,this one is trusting god day by day and
ca9tHTUK9z8,201360,203200,it's by joyce meyer i've been enjoying
ca9tHTUK9z8,203200,205519,it so far it's pretty good um but i'll
ca9tHTUK9z8,205519,207680,continue to update you guys on it since
ca9tHTUK9z8,207680,209760,i absolutely love the jesus calling ones
ca9tHTUK9z8,209760,211200,those are the ones i've always used
ca9tHTUK9z8,211200,213280,before i get into anything else i'm
ca9tHTUK9z8,213280,216400,gonna go and do a full shower routine
ca9tHTUK9z8,216400,219280,and my full hair care routine because to
ca9tHTUK9z8,219280,221599,me self-care is really like besides
ca9tHTUK9z8,221599,223040,taking care of your mental health
ca9tHTUK9z8,223040,224480,there's things that i feel like take
ca9tHTUK9z8,224480,226799,care of your physical well-being but
ca9tHTUK9z8,226799,229120,also like in turn just make you mentally
ca9tHTUK9z8,229120,230560,feel better like i know when i have a
ca9tHTUK9z8,230560,233360,good long hot shower i just i feel so
ca9tHTUK9z8,233360,235360,good so we are gonna we're gonna go do
ca9tHTUK9z8,235360,238360,that
ca9tHTUK9z8,238420,273680,[Music]
ca9tHTUK9z8,273680,275759,i just finished my
ca9tHTUK9z8,275759,278240,full body skincare face skincare shower
ca9tHTUK9z8,278240,280080,care obviously whenever i'm washing my
ca9tHTUK9z8,280080,281360,hair i always put it up in a little
ca9tHTUK9z8,281360,283280,towel wrap afterwards
ca9tHTUK9z8,283280,284960,but it can come down now because we are
ca9tHTUK9z8,284960,287840,going to do a little bit of hair care
ca9tHTUK9z8,287840,290000,today's video is in partnership with
ca9tHTUK9z8,290000,291759,tangle teaser so big thank you to tangle
ca9tHTUK9z8,291759,293280,teaser for partnering with me on today's
ca9tHTUK9z8,293280,294960,video but i've been using their brushes
ca9tHTUK9z8,294960,296960,for a little while now the first one
ca9tHTUK9z8,296960,298080,that you would have saw me use is
ca9tHTUK9z8,298080,299199,actually the one that i used in the
ca9tHTUK9z8,299199,301360,shower so that was this little guy here
ca9tHTUK9z8,301360,303600,tangle teaser's scalp exfoliator and
ca9tHTUK9z8,303600,305840,massager so you can use this on wet or
ca9tHTUK9z8,305840,308639,dry hair as a little scalp exfoliant or
ca9tHTUK9z8,308639,311039,massager with or without conditioner so
ca9tHTUK9z8,311039,312560,i've been using it with conditioner in
ca9tHTUK9z8,312560,314960,the shower to get rid of all that dead
ca9tHTUK9z8,314960,317120,skin and build up on my scalp especially
ca9tHTUK9z8,317120,318880,in the winter for me with someone with
ca9tHTUK9z8,318880,321600,dry skin my scalp gets really dry and
ca9tHTUK9z8,321600,323360,itchy and so this just helps to get rid
ca9tHTUK9z8,323360,326240,of all that excess dry skin off my scalp
ca9tHTUK9z8,326240,327199,and i've been really trying to
ca9tHTUK9z8,327199,330240,prioritize just my scalp health as much
ca9tHTUK9z8,330240,332400,as like i prioritize my skin health
ca9tHTUK9z8,332400,334639,everywhere else i feel like my hair and
ca9tHTUK9z8,334639,335840,my scalp is something that i really
ca9tHTUK9z8,335840,337199,neglected and it's something i've been
ca9tHTUK9z8,337199,339520,trying to work on for this year next i'm
ca9tHTUK9z8,339520,340800,going to go in with tangle teasers
ca9tHTUK9z8,340800,343039,ultimate detangler for finer and thin
ca9tHTUK9z8,343039,345680,hair it's for use on wet hair only you
ca9tHTUK9z8,345680,347759,start at the bottoms always basically
ca9tHTUK9z8,347759,349280,this just helps get rid of all that
ca9tHTUK9z8,349280,352240,excess dead hair that is just staying in
ca9tHTUK9z8,352240,354800,your hair and obviously detangle your
ca9tHTUK9z8,354800,356720,wet hair from the shower so starting at
ca9tHTUK9z8,356720,358639,the bottoms and working my way up to the
ca9tHTUK9z8,358639,360610,roots
ca9tHTUK9z8,360610,367600,[Music]
ca9tHTUK9z8,367600,369759,so this brush like i already mentioned
ca9tHTUK9z8,369759,372000,is for detangling and has super thin
ca9tHTUK9z8,372000,374000,fine teeth that are really soft designed
ca9tHTUK9z8,374000,376160,to just help minimize breakage are
ca9tHTUK9z8,376160,377919,perfect for if you're putting on hair
ca9tHTUK9z8,377919,380319,masks which is something i've never had
ca9tHTUK9z8,380319,382479,before i always run my fingers through
ca9tHTUK9z8,382479,383840,my hair with the hair masks but what
ca9tHTUK9z8,383840,385360,i've been doing hair mask recently i've
ca9tHTUK9z8,385360,387039,been loving using this brush to just
ca9tHTUK9z8,387039,389360,help put it on and really get the mask
ca9tHTUK9z8,389360,391840,fully through all of my hair it's been
ca9tHTUK9z8,391840,393840,amazing i'm not going to do a hair mask
ca9tHTUK9z8,393840,395600,today because i just washed my hair
ca9tHTUK9z8,395600,397440,normally i would do a hair mask before i
ca9tHTUK9z8,397440,399919,wash my hair so this brush is not meant
ca9tHTUK9z8,399919,402160,to be used with heat whatsoever at all
ca9tHTUK9z8,402160,404160,and only on wet hair so i'm just going
ca9tHTUK9z8,404160,406479,to put a little bit of hair oil on and
ca9tHTUK9z8,406479,409520,then give my hair another brush through
ca9tHTUK9z8,409520,421199,[Music]
ca9tHTUK9z8,421199,423680,but i've absolutely been loving the
ca9tHTUK9z8,423680,426160,results and changes i'm seeing in my
ca9tHTUK9z8,426160,428800,hair and just making sure my scalp is so
ca9tHTUK9z8,428800,431039,much healthier and taken care of
ca9tHTUK9z8,431039,433280,but you guys can check out all of tangle
ca9tHTUK9z8,433280,434800,teasers brushes with a link in the
ca9tHTUK9z8,434800,436639,description box and again a big thank
ca9tHTUK9z8,436639,438319,you to tangle teaser for partnering with
ca9tHTUK9z8,438319,440800,me on today's video we are going to go
ca9tHTUK9z8,440800,442800,get dressed and do my makeup now and get
ca9tHTUK9z8,442800,444800,on with the rest of our self-care day
ca9tHTUK9z8,444800,446240,even though i'm just at home i'm
ca9tHTUK9z8,446240,447680,actually gonna get dressed today so i'm
ca9tHTUK9z8,447680,450160,gonna throw on these denim and then this
ca9tHTUK9z8,450160,452960,little tank top cardigan duo because
ca9tHTUK9z8,452960,455199,i i don't know like self-care can be a
ca9tHTUK9z8,455199,456880,lot of things and sometimes it's getting
ca9tHTUK9z8,456880,458479,cozy and sometimes it's actually putting
ca9tHTUK9z8,458479,460240,yourself together and so today for me
ca9tHTUK9z8,460240,461360,it's going to be actually getting
ca9tHTUK9z8,461360,463280,dressed and like putting on an outfit i
ca9tHTUK9z8,463280,464960,went ahead and i just threw my hair into
ca9tHTUK9z8,464960,466720,a little casual bun this is always my
ca9tHTUK9z8,466720,468560,go-to especially when my hair is clean
ca9tHTUK9z8,468560,471759,because my hair is wavy as it is so when
ca9tHTUK9z8,471759,473840,it's still slightly damp i always do
ca9tHTUK9z8,473840,475919,this and then it just gives it some more
ca9tHTUK9z8,475919,478479,defined waves like my hair is like not
ca9tHTUK9z8,478479,480240,straight but not wavy you know so it
ca9tHTUK9z8,480240,482400,never really has a good
ca9tHTUK9z8,482400,485199,a good thing going if i don't do
ca9tHTUK9z8,485199,487680,something to it so when i'm not using
ca9tHTUK9z8,487680,490879,any heat this is my go-to and then this
ca9tHTUK9z8,490879,492400,is the little outfit for the day
ca9tHTUK9z8,492400,494960,like i was saying for me self-care and
ca9tHTUK9z8,494960,496960,literally the definition is like taking
ca9tHTUK9z8,496960,499440,care of yourself is whatever you're
ca9tHTUK9z8,499440,502800,needing that day so today i needed and
ca9tHTUK9z8,502800,504639,wanted to put myself together to get
ca9tHTUK9z8,504639,506720,ready and that is self-care to me for
ca9tHTUK9z8,506720,509039,today because i haven't done my makeup
ca9tHTUK9z8,509039,511360,in like almost two weeks i did it once
ca9tHTUK9z8,511360,512880,in the past two weeks and i've also been
ca9tHTUK9z8,512880,514719,wearing leggings and crewnecks
ca9tHTUK9z8,514719,517039,completely for the last two weeks so i
ca9tHTUK9z8,517039,519518,felt the need to put on a little bit of
ca9tHTUK9z8,519518,521039,like actual clothing even though i'm
ca9tHTUK9z8,521039,523360,just staying home and i'm snowed in but
ca9tHTUK9z8,523360,525120,then keeping it cozy still i have on my
ca9tHTUK9z8,525120,527519,little fluffy slides so i originally
ca9tHTUK9z8,527519,530000,wanted to go on a podcast walk today and
ca9tHTUK9z8,530000,532240,that was before i woke up and saw the
ca9tHTUK9z8,532240,534240,two feet of snow so we are not going on
ca9tHTUK9z8,534240,535680,a podcast walk we're gonna do a little
ca9tHTUK9z8,535680,538480,podcast clean and tidy so like just
ca9tHTUK9z8,538480,540800,anything that i feel like hasn't been
ca9tHTUK9z8,540800,543120,cleaned in a while may need a little bit
ca9tHTUK9z8,543120,545839,of dusting or just you know a good clean
ca9tHTUK9z8,545839,548959,and listen to a podcast because i love
ca9tHTUK9z8,548959,550480,listening to podcasts and all of my
ca9tHTUK9z8,550480,552560,favorite ones are like girl chat like
ca9tHTUK9z8,552560,554160,you're face timing with a best friend

ca9tHTUK9z8,580640,582240,podcast and of course i've been
ca9tHTUK9z8,582240,584399,listening to it so there's not your
ca9tHTUK9z8,584399,586560,typical with caitlin nolan and this is

ca9tHTUK9z8,617360,621519,i don't usually cry at all
ca9tHTUK9z8,621519,626240,but why is it always close ranging from
ca9tHTUK9z8,626240,628800,a movie scene
ca9tHTUK9z8,628800,632800,to maine of people
ca9tHTUK9z8,634460,641320,[Music]

ca9tHTUK9z8,645279,647120,session and right now i'm actually gonna
ca9tHTUK9z8,647120,649519,do a little yoga a little daily movement
ca9tHTUK9z8,649519,652160,because that's something that personally
ca9tHTUK9z8,652160,653920,whether it's a self-care day or not i
ca9tHTUK9z8,653920,656720,love to be able to implement into just
ca9tHTUK9z8,656720,658800,my day so yesterday i actually did a
ca9tHTUK9z8,658800,660560,really hard workout so today we're doing
ca9tHTUK9z8,660560,661839,a little bit of a recovery and i'm gonna
ca9tHTUK9z8,661839,663680,do either just like a stretch session or

ca9tHTUK9z8,672240,674640,and just a comfy hoodie and a workout
ca9tHTUK9z8,674640,677200,bra comfy cozy don't feel like you
ca9tHTUK9z8,677200,679760,honestly have to put on anything in
ca9tHTUK9z8,679760,682800,particular to do a little daily movement
ca9tHTUK9z8,682800,684720,i just didn't want to do yoga and jeans
ca9tHTUK9z8,684720,687600,so i changed but yeah like your daily
ca9tHTUK9z8,687600,689920,movement should be something that is
ca9tHTUK9z8,689920,692240,comfortable if it's not a hard workout
ca9tHTUK9z8,692240,694959,you shouldn't feel pressured to like
ca9tHTUK9z8,694959,696640,do anything in particular you know as
ca9tHTUK9z8,696640,698160,long as you're moving your body i always
ca9tHTUK9z8,698160,701279,say any movement is good movement and so
ca9tHTUK9z8,701279,702880,that's what we're doing for today's
ca9tHTUK9z8,702880,706120,little movement
ca9tHTUK9z8,709480,722570,[Music]
ca9tHTUK9z8,724880,725960,just
ca9tHTUK9z8,725960,739600,[Music]
ca9tHTUK9z8,739600,744300,and i pray that it won't be over
ca9tHTUK9z8,744300,750058,[Music]
ca9tHTUK9z8,750639,754639,just wait it won't be too long till we
ca9tHTUK9z8,754639,759639,arrive the coming day
ca9tHTUK9z8,761320,765459,[Music]
ca9tHTUK9z8,765800,770480,together ever since we left i guess it
ca9tHTUK9z8,770480,772800,just
ca9tHTUK9z8,779490,785519,[Music]
ca9tHTUK9z8,785519,788440,i really miss the shades
ca9tHTUK9z8,788440,810160,[Music]
ca9tHTUK9z8,810160,812660,so
ca9tHTUK9z8,812660,819360,[Music]
ca9tHTUK9z8,819360,822360,oh
ca9tHTUK9z8,826480,831519,[Music]
ca9tHTUK9z8,831519,834519,oh
ca9tHTUK9z8,834870,849130,[Music]
ca9tHTUK9z8,849519,851279,so an important part of not only every
ca9tHTUK9z8,851279,853279,day but an important part of a self-care
ca9tHTUK9z8,853279,855519,day is making sure my body is nourished
ca9tHTUK9z8,855519,857360,eating nutritious meals
ca9tHTUK9z8,857360,859199,and so i even took care of future
ca9tHTUK9z8,859199,861519,vanessa and when i made lunch today i
ca9tHTUK9z8,861519,863760,made my classic giant tuna salad super
ca9tHTUK9z8,863760,865519,easy and quick i made enough that i have
ca9tHTUK9z8,865519,867440,for tomorrow as well so
ca9tHTUK9z8,867440,870000,we love that and then also of course
ca9tHTUK9z8,870000,872160,staying hydrated i just have this giant
ca9tHTUK9z8,872160,873839,starbucks water bottle
ca9tHTUK9z8,873839,874639,and
ca9tHTUK9z8,874639,876959,i probably try and drink four to five of
ca9tHTUK9z8,876959,878240,these a day
ca9tHTUK9z8,878240,879760,fun fact 80
ca9tHTUK9z8,879760,882639,of the world is chronically dehydrated
ca9tHTUK9z8,882639,884320,so this is your reminder to go drink
ca9tHTUK9z8,884320,886320,your water if you haven't today
ca9tHTUK9z8,886320,889440,um but yeah super important that you eat
ca9tHTUK9z8,889440,891920,food if you're feeling a self-care day
ca9tHTUK9z8,891920,893839,maybe you need more of a comfort meal
ca9tHTUK9z8,893839,896480,something that is more enjoyable but
ca9tHTUK9z8,896480,898880,whatever it is just make sure you are
ca9tHTUK9z8,898880,900639,nourishing your body i'm going to eat my
ca9tHTUK9z8,900639,902480,lunch and drink my water i'm also going
ca9tHTUK9z8,902480,904000,to read a little bit just because during
ca9tHTUK9z8,904000,905600,my self-care days i like to try and stay
ca9tHTUK9z8,905600,907600,off my phone as much as possible so i'm
ca9tHTUK9z8,907600,908959,going to read some of my current read
ca9tHTUK9z8,908959,912839,which is the cruel prince
ca9tHTUK9z8,912980,933079,[Music]
ca9tHTUK9z8,935600,940399,i pray that it won't be over
ca9tHTUK9z8,940399,943360,something that i absolutely love
ca9tHTUK9z8,943360,946720,especially in the winter is sitting with
ca9tHTUK9z8,946720,949600,my heated blanket because it's just so
ca9tHTUK9z8,949600,951920,cold outside and like i can see the snow
ca9tHTUK9z8,951920,953920,and i'm just in here cozy and warm my
ca9tHTUK9z8,953920,955920,heated blanket and it makes me feel so
ca9tHTUK9z8,955920,957759,good and warm and fuzzy
ca9tHTUK9z8,957759,959040,um something that's gonna be a little
ca9tHTUK9z8,959040,960959,bit controversial for a self-care day
ca9tHTUK9z8,960959,962480,i'm actually gonna do a little bit of
ca9tHTUK9z8,962480,963360,work
ca9tHTUK9z8,963360,965759,but mind you it's a little bit of like
ca9tHTUK9z8,965759,966839,mindless
ca9tHTUK9z8,966839,969040,work um it's more such as like
ca9tHTUK9z8,969040,971680,organizing and writing to-do lists of
ca9tHTUK9z8,971680,973519,things that i have to get done
ca9tHTUK9z8,973519,975519,this week just like kind of like
ca9tHTUK9z8,975519,978000,planning so not necessarily really work
ca9tHTUK9z8,978000,980079,but like just a little bit of planning
ca9tHTUK9z8,980079,983759,just to put my mind a little bit at ease
ca9tHTUK9z8,983759,985440,so that's what i'm gonna do now is i'm
ca9tHTUK9z8,985440,988000,gonna sit in my lovely heated blanket
ca9tHTUK9z8,988000,990000,this afternoon and just
ca9tHTUK9z8,990000,991759,kind of like twiddle around total my
ca9tHTUK9z8,991759,993600,thumbs a little bit and do like some
ca9tHTUK9z8,993600,997930,minimal mindless work for a little bit

ca9tHTUK9z8,1104300,1112559,[Music]
ca9tHTUK9z8,1112559,1115200,okay i decided tonight i'd light one of
ca9tHTUK9z8,1115200,1119120,my bubble candles for the first time
ca9tHTUK9z8,1120799,1122160,i'm a little nervous to see how this
ca9tHTUK9z8,1122160,1123520,burns because i've never burned one of
ca9tHTUK9z8,1123520,1124880,these before and i literally have like
ca9tHTUK9z8,1124880,1126080,four of them
ca9tHTUK9z8,1126080,1128640,um so we'll see but i think they're so
ca9tHTUK9z8,1128640,1131120,cute and it's time i finally lit one of
ca9tHTUK9z8,1131120,1133039,them we have the candles also i know i'm
ca9tHTUK9z8,1133039,1134640,gonna get asked i just got this little
ca9tHTUK9z8,1134640,1136320,electric lighter off amazon i'll have it
ca9tHTUK9z8,1136320,1138320,linked on my amazon shop but we have the
ca9tHTUK9z8,1138320,1140880,candles two little guys going over here
ca9tHTUK9z8,1140880,1142960,i think that one's gonna burn out tea
ca9tHTUK9z8,1142960,1145120,and water over there now i'm just gonna
ca9tHTUK9z8,1145120,1147330,make my bed all cozy
ca9tHTUK9z8,1147330,1160979,[Music]
ca9tHTUK9z8,1162799,1164960,so for my little skincare tonight i just
ca9tHTUK9z8,1164960,1166320,did a little
ca9tHTUK9z8,1166320,1169039,rose i think it was rose face mask it
ca9tHTUK9z8,1169039,1172000,was a nourishing one and then i did my
ca9tHTUK9z8,1172000,1174960,little lip scrubby and mask afterwards
ca9tHTUK9z8,1174960,1176720,of course now i'm gonna do a little bit
ca9tHTUK9z8,1176720,1178720,more reading i'm gonna try and finish
ca9tHTUK9z8,1178720,1180320,the cruel prince tonight i don't have
ca9tHTUK9z8,1180320,1182960,too much left i have about 40 pages
ca9tHTUK9z8,1182960,1184880,definitely can crush that tonight
ca9tHTUK9z8,1184880,1186640,so we're gonna do that and i have my
ca9tHTUK9z8,1186640,1188480,chamomile tea i think i've mentioned
ca9tHTUK9z8,1188480,1190240,this before but like it is imperative if
ca9tHTUK9z8,1190240,1191520,you're having tea at night to have a
ca9tHTUK9z8,1191520,1194080,herbal tea non-caffeinated as long as it
ca9tHTUK9z8,1194080,1196559,says herbal it's decaf i typically stick
ca9tHTUK9z8,1196559,1198480,to a ginger or peppermint but tonight
ca9tHTUK9z8,1198480,1199760,you went with chamomile just to switch
ca9tHTUK9z8,1199760,1201679,it up and i find chamomile is a very
ca9tHTUK9z8,1201679,1204480,like calming sleepy team so that's also
ca9tHTUK9z8,1204480,1206640,why i had it tonight but i'm gonna read
ca9tHTUK9z8,1206640,1208080,for a little bit and then probably
ca9tHTUK9z8,1208080,1210480,finish up the night with my nightly five
ca9tHTUK9z8,1210480,1215000,minute journal and then call it a night

ca9tHTUK9z8,1244640,1246240,the morning one so i'm trying this year
ca9tHTUK9z8,1246240,1247760,to remember to do
