tIYs17kPhWU,2771440,2777839,cleaned up the beach  good job  hey remember earlier that we found some
tIYs17kPhWU,2777839,2784319,things  yeah we found this fern  yeah i'm gonna show you something really
tIYs17kPhWU,2784319,2789760,cool with it very soon  and then we found this shell
tIYs17kPhWU,2789760,2795300,yeah  we found this pine cone
tIYs17kPhWU,2795300,2801680,[Music]  and  we found this bird feather
tIYs17kPhWU,2801680,2807280,wow  okay we'll put that right there
tIYs17kPhWU,2807280,2813440,okay well this stick used to be a hiking  stick that we used all day that was
tIYs17kPhWU,2813440,2819680,great but we're actually gonna turn it  into what's called a journey stick yeah
tIYs17kPhWU,2819680,2826720,indigenous people from different  countries used to make what's called  journey sticks they would collect things
tIYs17kPhWU,2826720,2832079,on their hikes and their journeys and  then they would put them on their sticks
tIYs17kPhWU,2832079,2839200,in chronological order so then they can  remember where they've been so let's do  that now
tIYs17kPhWU,2839680,2845680,so let's take this big fern  put it right there i actually have some
tIYs17kPhWU,2845680,2852559,orange string  yeah  i'm gonna wrap it around

tIYs17kPhWU,2878880,2885318,that's gonna be tricky to put on there  but i think we can do it
tIYs17kPhWU,2889760,2895599,there it is you see that  yeah this is looking awesome
tIYs17kPhWU,2895599,2901760,and then we have this pine cone  and i'll put right below that shell

tIYs17kPhWU,3056480,3063119,yeah but we actually need to make it a  triangle  so let's take our scissors
tIYs17kPhWU,3063119,3069359,yup  with your parents grown-up supervision  you can cut this

tIYs17kPhWU,3096880,3102640,look at that it used to be a square but  now it's a triangle
tIYs17kPhWU,3102640,3109839,okay now we need some tape to then tape  it to make the top of the rocket ship
tIYs17kPhWU,3109839,3116800,okay here we go let's grab the tape  pull off a big piece of tape
tIYs17kPhWU,3116800,3122839,whoa  all right  let's get the little slice  [Music]
tIYs17kPhWU,3122839,3129040,okay there we go  whoa  [Music]

tIYs17kPhWU,3136160,3142559,today we're making a rocket ship but one  time i made a monster truck another time
tIYs17kPhWU,3142559,3148720,i made a dolphin  and i named that dolphin
tIYs17kPhWU,3148720,3154000,uh what was that name i think it was  dolphy
tIYs17kPhWU,3154000,3159839,oh  sometimes the tape gets stuck but that's  okay we got it
tIYs17kPhWU,3159839,3166880,all right  there we go  give it a little slice
tIYs17kPhWU,3166880,3172240,and then  tape up the other side  wow
tIYs17kPhWU,3172240,3178319,here we go  i am so excited to go into outer space
tIYs17kPhWU,3178319,3183599,have you ever seen the stars at night  yeah they're so bright
tIYs17kPhWU,3183599,3191280,and the moon  i love the moon have you noticed that  the moon sometimes is a full moon
tIYs17kPhWU,3191280,3198079,yeah sometimes  it's a half moon  and sometimes it's a new moon
tIYs17kPhWU,3198079,3206559,yeah okay let's uh give this a little  twist  now it's time to design our rocket ship
tIYs17kPhWU,3206559,3213280,i am so excited this is one of my  favorite parts  so  the first step to design
tIYs17kPhWU,3213280,3220720,is to have a plan  let's take this  white piece of paper right here
tIYs17kPhWU,3220720,3225760,and let's draw the rocket ship  so the first thing you need to do is
tIYs17kPhWU,3225760,3231040,plan plan how the rocket ship is going  to look so let's draw the rocket ship
tIYs17kPhWU,3231040,3238000,so we have a trapezoid over here  and then we have a big
tIYs17kPhWU,3238000,3243680,rectangle for the body of the rocket  ship  and then we have a triangle
tIYs17kPhWU,3243680,3251680,for the cone of  the rocket ship  and obviously i want a lot of color so
tIYs17kPhWU,3251680,3257040,first let's take some orange  perfect
tIYs17kPhWU,3257040,3262240,i love orange and then let's take some  blue  so
tIYs17kPhWU,3262240,3268880,let's  color it in  [Music]  i have a plan i'm gonna use
tIYs17kPhWU,3268880,3274800,colored paper for that so i'm actually  gonna use this black marker to symbolize
tIYs17kPhWU,3274800,3280400,that these are pieces of paper and we  will do that later
tIYs17kPhWU,3280400,3286079,all right oh whoa there's a lot of stars  here so let's actually you know make
tIYs17kPhWU,3286079,3291440,some stars right here  yeah  yeah i love stars
tIYs17kPhWU,3291440,3296960,because you see them at night time when  you look up in the sky and they twinkle
tIYs17kPhWU,3296960,3303280,yeah kind of like twinkle twinkle little  star how i wonder what you are
tIYs17kPhWU,3303280,3310640,you know that song i like that song too  oh and yellow  yeah that's a beautiful color
tIYs17kPhWU,3310640,3316640,wow our rocket ship is looking so good  all right i think i have a really good
tIYs17kPhWU,3316640,3322079,idea let's take the color red because  it's nice and bright and spell my name
tIYs17kPhWU,3322079,3326720,will you spell my name with me  ready
tIYs17kPhWU,3327839,3334760,e  l  i
tIYs17kPhWU,3335850,3340440,[Music]
tIYs17kPhWU,3341680,3348079,perfect all right so that is the plan  oh  looks like this triangle the top of the
tIYs17kPhWU,3348079,3354000,rocket ship yeah we could color it how  about we color it yeah
tIYs17kPhWU,3354000,3360160,blue i like blue and we actually have a  lot of blue paint on the
tIYs17kPhWU,3360160,3365760,here so we can actually just use blue  paint for this part  wow
tIYs17kPhWU,3365760,3372160,perfect  whoa i think if we can make this  rocket ship in real life it's going to
tIYs17kPhWU,3372160,3377680,be so good all right here we go  all right like i said first thing we
tIYs17kPhWU,3377680,3384640,have to do is use the blue and orange  colored paper  to put on the side just like this
tIYs17kPhWU,3384640,3391359,so let's take the glue stick  yeah  yep put a lot of
tIYs17kPhWU,3391359,3397680,glue right on the backs  just like that
tIYs17kPhWU,3397680,3405830,okay  there's two pieces  okay  there's one

tIYs17kPhWU,3444480,3450640,three four so let me finish the rest and  then we'll see how many we have in total
tIYs17kPhWU,3450640,3460619,after i'm all done all right  [Music]
tIYs17kPhWU,3461920,3466960,it's falling apart  well sometimes if things fall apart you
tIYs17kPhWU,3466960,3472880,just have to fix them  okay  here we go and after we fix this then we
tIYs17kPhWU,3472880,3480558,can count all of the colors  so  let's take our tape
tIYs17kPhWU,3484880,3492880,all right now the rocket booster is all  fixed  yep there we go okay now let's count all
tIYs17kPhWU,3492880,3499040,of the colored pieces yeah the blue and  the orange pieces those are my two

tIYs17kPhWU,3523040,3528559,of our rocket ship to go to outer space  we had stars
tIYs17kPhWU,3528559,3534960,yeah remember we had  yellow stars
tIYs17kPhWU,3535190,3541810,[Music]  yellow star

tIYs17kPhWU,3741119,3748880,and then  we need to make sure  we don't mix  the red and the blue because then it
tIYs17kPhWU,3748880,3755119,won't be red anymore  and it won't be blue  do you know what color you get when you
tIYs17kPhWU,3755119,3761119,mix blue and red  yep purple

tIYs17kPhWU,3790559,3796640,we should probably lay it down sideways  because we need to write my name which  is sideways
tIYs17kPhWU,3796640,3802400,yeah  there we go  like that  that's how we write
tIYs17kPhWU,3802400,3807279,sideways  okay  let's take

tIYs17kPhWU,3873920,3880880,there we go  we just completed the rocket ship so now  we gotta get inside
tIYs17kPhWU,3880880,3889039,oh no  do you see what i did  we are so silly
tIYs17kPhWU,3889440,3895200,check this out  the window is right there yeah
tIYs17kPhWU,3895200,3900480,that means  we have to  twist it this way

tIYs17kPhWU,3907200,3912559,that's okay though we're gonna fly  through outer space in this new
tIYs17kPhWU,3912559,3919039,cardboard rocket ship i am so excited  with my name being upside down
tIYs17kPhWU,3919039,3927720,so silly are you ready  because i sure am here we go
tIYs17kPhWU,3936880,3943760,hey  i love outer space good job building the  rocket ship with me now that we're in
tIYs17kPhWU,3943760,3949200,outer space i think we should explore  our solar system and learn all about it
tIYs17kPhWU,3949200,3952480,all right here we go
tIYs17kPhWU,3956559,3962799,whoa  look at that that is our sun and its  name is called

tIYs17kPhWU,3969680,3975440,that light takes eight minutes to go  from the sun to our planet earth
tIYs17kPhWU,3975440,3984640,and the sun is so big there's 1.3  million earths that can fit inside of it
tIYs17kPhWU,3984640,3990119,that's a lot of earths here we go

tIYs17kPhWU,4011599,4020240,one rotation around the sun is super  fast it's only about 88 days on earth
tIYs17kPhWU,4020240,4023520,mercury is awesome
tIYs17kPhWU,4028400,4035680,now we're at another planet look at that  planet that planet is the planet venus
