DWW0Xm5hi_I,160,2560,hello everyone i'm marina and it's a
DWW0Xm5hi_I,2560,4880,grammatical in the comments some of you
DWW0Xm5hi_I,4880,7440,have been asking me to show how to do a
DWW0Xm5hi_I,7440,10320,nail correction on gel tips well i will
DWW0Xm5hi_I,10320,14679,demonstrate it on my nails today
DWW0Xm5hi_I,17279,19119,here they are
DWW0Xm5hi_I,19119,20960,don't let this different thumb confuse
DWW0Xm5hi_I,20960,22160,you
DWW0Xm5hi_I,22160,25359,i did this very nail art on my left hand
DWW0Xm5hi_I,25359,27840,and here it was really hard to recreate
DWW0Xm5hi_I,27840,29679,with my non-dominant hand
DWW0Xm5hi_I,29679,30400,so
DWW0Xm5hi_I,30400,32960,i decided to extend this hand using gel
DWW0Xm5hi_I,32960,35920,tips and a base coat
DWW0Xm5hi_I,35920,38640,these are easy nails tips by the brand
DWW0Xm5hi_I,38640,40559,man
DWW0Xm5hi_I,40559,42800,there are various shapes available such
DWW0Xm5hi_I,42800,45520,as a stiletto or a ballerina
DWW0Xm5hi_I,45520,47440,the only thing is that these tips are
DWW0Xm5hi_I,47440,50079,rather flat while my nail plate is
DWW0Xm5hi_I,50079,51920,naturally arched
DWW0Xm5hi_I,51920,54960,so i struggled with the application
DWW0Xm5hi_I,54960,58000,i had to boil the tips
DWW0Xm5hi_I,58000,61039,well i basically put them into hot water
DWW0Xm5hi_I,61039,63760,plastic got softer and i just pinched it
DWW0Xm5hi_I,63760,65119,really hard
DWW0Xm5hi_I,65119,67680,and each time the arch got more and more
DWW0Xm5hi_I,67680,69920,curved until it could finally fit my
DWW0Xm5hi_I,69920,71520,nail plate
DWW0Xm5hi_I,71520,74000,but from the top view they still look a
DWW0Xm5hi_I,74000,75200,bit flat
DWW0Xm5hi_I,75200,78479,considering how hard i was pinching them
DWW0Xm5hi_I,78479,80799,so we'll see if i can fix this with a
DWW0Xm5hi_I,80799,82720,layout
DWW0Xm5hi_I,82720,85200,now i take off the previous base coat
DWW0Xm5hi_I,85200,88159,the one with a soft gradient
DWW0Xm5hi_I,88159,90320,and next up i need to clean up all the
DWW0Xm5hi_I,90320,93280,liftings in the cuticle zone
DWW0Xm5hi_I,93280,95520,this must have been caused by some base
DWW0Xm5hi_I,95520,97759,coat pooling
DWW0Xm5hi_I,97759,100640,but overall this tips lasted pretty good
DWW0Xm5hi_I,100640,103040,so i am pleasantly surprised for
DWW0Xm5hi_I,103040,105119,instance there are no cracks in the
DWW0Xm5hi_I,105119,107680,ingross points which is shocking for my
DWW0Xm5hi_I,107680,108880,nails
DWW0Xm5hi_I,108880,111280,since my nails are trapezoidal cracks
DWW0Xm5hi_I,111280,113680,are a common issue but the are black
DWW0Xm5hi_I,113680,116159,lines on the index nail
DWW0Xm5hi_I,116159,118799,this is hemorrhagia
DWW0Xm5hi_I,118799,122240,and it was caused by my attempt to catch
DWW0Xm5hi_I,122240,124799,my fallen child
DWW0Xm5hi_I,124799,127360,it was successful but i hid this nail
DWW0Xm5hi_I,127360,129520,really hard the next day after the
DWW0Xm5hi_I,129520,130800,extension
DWW0Xm5hi_I,130800,133360,and we know that it is when the nails
DWW0Xm5hi_I,133360,134959,are the hardest
DWW0Xm5hi_I,134959,137760,so that hurt badly
DWW0Xm5hi_I,137760,139760,now i will just have to wait until it
DWW0Xm5hi_I,139760,140800,grows
DWW0Xm5hi_I,140800,143520,so it's not a nail burn or a result of a
DWW0Xm5hi_I,143520,147200,poor nail extension it is just a head
DWW0Xm5hi_I,147200,149200,i have taken off the coating and there
DWW0Xm5hi_I,149200,151519,is only the tip left
DWW0Xm5hi_I,151519,153840,so next we need to mat the nail plate
DWW0Xm5hi_I,153840,155760,and smooth out the transition between
DWW0Xm5hi_I,155760,158319,the nail and the tip
DWW0Xm5hi_I,158319,160319,make sure to clean up all the liftings
DWW0Xm5hi_I,160319,162080,at this point
DWW0Xm5hi_I,162080,164640,since otherwise they will just spread
DWW0Xm5hi_I,164640,166560,further
DWW0Xm5hi_I,166560,169040,use a 180 grit nail file for this
DWW0Xm5hi_I,169040,172400,purpose to make sure that it is not just
DWW0Xm5hi_I,172400,174720,polishing the nail plate
DWW0Xm5hi_I,174720,176800,and don't file one area for too long
DWW0Xm5hi_I,176800,179599,cause it may hit up the nail surface
DWW0Xm5hi_I,179599,182239,now i'm doing a combined manicure
DWW0Xm5hi_I,182239,184560,as you may know i don't have much
DWW0Xm5hi_I,184560,187680,cuticle going on but i do have lots of
DWW0Xm5hi_I,187680,189760,pterygium
DWW0Xm5hi_I,189760,193280,especially here in the sinuses
DWW0Xm5hi_I,193280,195840,so i must clean it up thoroughly to
DWW0Xm5hi_I,195840,198400,avoid pulling and lifting
DWW0Xm5hi_I,198400,201120,this step is a must for me
DWW0Xm5hi_I,201120,203280,now we can polish the cuticle with the
DWW0Xm5hi_I,203280,205120,same flame drill bit
DWW0Xm5hi_I,205120,207920,or any other one
DWW0Xm5hi_I,207920,210000,it is not very convenient to do an
DWW0Xm5hi_I,210000,212080,e-file manicure with your non-dominant
DWW0Xm5hi_I,212080,214400,hand because it takes lots of skin
DWW0Xm5hi_I,214400,218159,pulling which is not an easy task
DWW0Xm5hi_I,218159,220080,in the forward position i clean up the
DWW0Xm5hi_I,220080,221920,lap sides
DWW0Xm5hi_I,221920,224480,next using the tip of the drill bit
DWW0Xm5hi_I,224480,226959,i clean up the sinuses
DWW0Xm5hi_I,226959,230080,and polish the lateral folds
DWW0Xm5hi_I,230080,232560,next i switch the rotation direction to
DWW0Xm5hi_I,232560,236560,reverse and process the right sides
DWW0Xm5hi_I,236560,240239,i also touch up some dry skin here
DWW0Xm5hi_I,240239,242000,done with polishing
DWW0Xm5hi_I,242000,244720,i decreased the cuticle and now that i
DWW0Xm5hi_I,244720,247360,have cleaned up the tip with acetone it
DWW0Xm5hi_I,247360,250159,got whiter and i can see that i have
DWW0Xm5hi_I,250159,253200,over filed the tip on the pinky nail
DWW0Xm5hi_I,253200,256000,so there's a tiny hole there which i
DWW0Xm5hi_I,256000,258959,will fill in with gel later
DWW0Xm5hi_I,258959,261120,now put some primer over the natural
DWW0Xm5hi_I,261120,262079,nail
DWW0Xm5hi_I,262079,265840,there is no point to use it on the tip
DWW0Xm5hi_I,265840,268000,and next we will just need to do a
DWW0Xm5hi_I,268000,270400,regular nail correction
DWW0Xm5hi_I,270400,272720,the tips act like base coat underlays
DWW0Xm5hi_I,272720,273759,here
DWW0Xm5hi_I,273759,275600,so we just need to build up the nail
DWW0Xm5hi_I,275600,277919,architecture
DWW0Xm5hi_I,277919,280800,i will be using a rubber base coat
DWW0Xm5hi_I,280800,283360,the same one that i used to stick this
DWW0Xm5hi_I,283360,284800,tips
DWW0Xm5hi_I,284800,287199,it worked out pretty good
DWW0Xm5hi_I,287199,290160,now make sure to apply a thin layer
DWW0Xm5hi_I,290160,293600,and avoid pulling
DWW0Xm5hi_I,294800,297919,do one nail at a time
DWW0Xm5hi_I,297919,300080,because applying it on four nails right
DWW0Xm5hi_I,300080,302800,away may result in its flowing and
DWW0Xm5hi_I,302800,305440,peeling off
DWW0Xm5hi_I,306880,310080,without any color on top we can see that
DWW0Xm5hi_I,310080,313280,the tips are rather wide
DWW0Xm5hi_I,313280,315759,and so are my natural nails
DWW0Xm5hi_I,315759,319520,which i'd like to make narrower
DWW0Xm5hi_I,319759,324360,so we'll see if pension will help
DWW0Xm5hi_I,324479,326560,i'm doing an ombre design this time
DWW0Xm5hi_I,326560,328320,around too
DWW0Xm5hi_I,328320,330320,let it be this neon yellow in the
DWW0Xm5hi_I,330320,332639,cuticle zone
DWW0Xm5hi_I,332639,335199,painting your own nails make sure to use
DWW0Xm5hi_I,335199,338400,a flat brush near the cuticle
DWW0Xm5hi_I,338400,341039,first things first i apply a thin layer
DWW0Xm5hi_I,341039,342479,of color
DWW0Xm5hi_I,342479,345120,to let the next thicker one spread over
DWW0Xm5hi_I,345120,346240,it
DWW0Xm5hi_I,346240,348400,i must admit that i had to hold my
DWW0Xm5hi_I,348400,350560,breath at this point
DWW0Xm5hi_I,350560,352400,because painting the cuticle line on
DWW0Xm5hi_I,352400,356080,camera is kinda stressful
DWW0Xm5hi_I,356080,358400,now i add some more
DWW0Xm5hi_I,358400,360880,and spread it over the tip because i
DWW0Xm5hi_I,360880,364560,plan to do it with one layer
DWW0Xm5hi_I,364560,366400,we can't just apply a thick layer
DWW0Xm5hi_I,366400,368400,because it may get all wrinkled after
DWW0Xm5hi_I,368400,370160,curing
DWW0Xm5hi_I,370160,373600,so pull the excess with the flat brush
DWW0Xm5hi_I,373600,376800,imitating the gradient
DWW0Xm5hi_I,376800,380160,it shouldn't be 100 smooth here because
DWW0Xm5hi_I,380160,384080,we will cover it up with a milky shade
DWW0Xm5hi_I,384080,386479,you can use any other color instead of
DWW0Xm5hi_I,386479,388720,yellow
DWW0Xm5hi_I,388720,390800,this design will look good with every
DWW0Xm5hi_I,390800,393280,single one
DWW0Xm5hi_I,393280,395680,but i decided to add some color to
DWW0Xm5hi_I,395680,398400,celebrate the summer time
DWW0Xm5hi_I,398400,400960,normally i avoid vibrant colors on my
DWW0Xm5hi_I,400960,402160,nails
DWW0Xm5hi_I,402160,406319,but this summer i want them to pop
DWW0Xm5hi_I,406319,408800,because colorful nails are such mood
DWW0Xm5hi_I,408800,410400,boosters
DWW0Xm5hi_I,410400,412960,and it's great when they mirror sunny
DWW0Xm5hi_I,412960,415680,summer days
DWW0Xm5hi_I,417199,421199,next up let's build up the architecture
DWW0Xm5hi_I,421199,423039,cover up the nail with a thin layer
DWW0Xm5hi_I,423039,424479,first
DWW0Xm5hi_I,424479,428720,then add a big drop of the milky gel
DWW0Xm5hi_I,428800,431199,make sure that it is big enough to cover
DWW0Xm5hi_I,431199,433919,up the nail plate
DWW0Xm5hi_I,433919,436880,smooth out the surface and add another
DWW0Xm5hi_I,436880,438400,drop
DWW0Xm5hi_I,438400,441280,the main advantage of this gel is its
DWW0Xm5hi_I,441280,443680,translucency
DWW0Xm5hi_I,443680,446000,that is what helps to form a smooth
DWW0Xm5hi_I,446000,447540,gradient
DWW0Xm5hi_I,447540,450720,[Music]
DWW0Xm5hi_I,450720,453919,now sand the nail secure for 20 seconds
DWW0Xm5hi_I,453919,456479,take it out and pinch it using thin
DWW0Xm5hi_I,456479,458639,pliers
DWW0Xm5hi_I,458639,461280,this is a manicure tool not a hardware
DWW0Xm5hi_I,461280,462800,one
DWW0Xm5hi_I,462800,465680,the main difference is that these pliers
DWW0Xm5hi_I,465680,468400,are smooth inside
DWW0Xm5hi_I,468400,471599,i got these from aliexpress
DWW0Xm5hi_I,471599,473680,i think i have already shown them to you
DWW0Xm5hi_I,473680,476000,in one of my previous videos
DWW0Xm5hi_I,476000,478160,there are a few videos on aliexpress
DWW0Xm5hi_I,478160,480479,products on my channel so check them out
DWW0Xm5hi_I,480479,482639,if you're interested
DWW0Xm5hi_I,482639,484800,now i set up a clip and sand the nail
DWW0Xm5hi_I,484800,487440,secure in the lamp
DWW0Xm5hi_I,487440,489919,so that's our working scheme we just
DWW0Xm5hi_I,489919,492319,need to use it on the rest of the nails
DWW0Xm5hi_I,492319,496319,don't apply too much to file less
DWW0Xm5hi_I,496319,498720,make sure to turn the hand over to check
DWW0Xm5hi_I,498720,500960,the symmetry
DWW0Xm5hi_I,500960,503199,and in case there are any flaws
DWW0Xm5hi_I,503199,506240,because the gel is pretty liquid it's
DWW0Xm5hi_I,506240,508319,perfect for strengthening but it may
DWW0Xm5hi_I,508319,509199,flow
DWW0Xm5hi_I,509199,511680,so just touch it up with a file and
DWW0Xm5hi_I,511680,514399,shape the nails
DWW0Xm5hi_I,515120,518240,i filed the thickest parts
DWW0Xm5hi_I,518240,522560,and that's not it yet let's spice it up
DWW0Xm5hi_I,522560,524720,there is such a nice camouflaging base
DWW0Xm5hi_I,524720,526480,coat by men
DWW0Xm5hi_I,526480,530480,it is translucent based with yuki flakes
DWW0Xm5hi_I,530480,534160,sadly i don't have a topcoat like that
DWW0Xm5hi_I,534160,537839,i think it puts this nailer together
DWW0Xm5hi_I,537839,539839,and the glitter nicely catches the
DWW0Xm5hi_I,539839,541360,sunlight
DWW0Xm5hi_I,541360,544240,now cover up the nails with a top coat
DWW0Xm5hi_I,544240,546959,i thought about adding some stickers or
DWW0Xm5hi_I,546959,548560,laddering here
DWW0Xm5hi_I,548560,549519,so
DWW0Xm5hi_I,549519,552160,i asked my cameraman if this nail art
DWW0Xm5hi_I,552160,553440,lagged something
DWW0Xm5hi_I,553440,554720,and you know what
DWW0Xm5hi_I,554720,557040,he liked it better this way
DWW0Xm5hi_I,557040,559040,so here we are
DWW0Xm5hi_I,559040,561200,and what do you think do we need more
DWW0Xm5hi_I,561200,562480,decor here
DWW0Xm5hi_I,562480,564320,that's it for the correction
DWW0Xm5hi_I,564320,566399,and if you have any questions on how to
DWW0Xm5hi_I,566399,569360,do an extension with gel tips then check
DWW0Xm5hi_I,569360,571519,out one of my previous videos
DWW0Xm5hi_I,571519,573760,and i wish you a success in your work
DWW0Xm5hi_I,573760,577360,good luck bye bye
