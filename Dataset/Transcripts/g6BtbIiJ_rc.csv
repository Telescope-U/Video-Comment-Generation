g6BtbIiJ_rc,211918,213002,have gone through
g6BtbIiJ_rc,213027,215217,you have to keep a student mentality.
g6BtbIiJ_rc,216536,218836,I studied and I failed the exam.
g6BtbIiJ_rc,218862,221544,I studied and I failed the test
g6BtbIiJ_rc,223329,227407,and life is an uphill war and it is filled with tests and exams
g6BtbIiJ_rc,227488,231298,and critical moments where you are going to have to dig deep inside of yourself
g6BtbIiJ_rc,231323,233487,and ask yourself why.
g6BtbIiJ_rc,233553,236219,Why did you start in the first place?
g6BtbIiJ_rc,236663,239448,"And what was the emotion, the feeling"
g6BtbIiJ_rc,239473,244782,what was the science and the psychology behind the decision that you made?
g6BtbIiJ_rc,244910,247790,And 9 times out of 10 I can tell you why you started.
g6BtbIiJ_rc,247815,250227,You started because you were hungry.
g6BtbIiJ_rc,252418,256575,Hunger is the feeling of discomfort or weakness caused
g6BtbIiJ_rc,256601,260315,by a lack of food coupled with a desire to eat.
g6BtbIiJ_rc,260340,262712,How hungry are you?
g6BtbIiJ_rc,263515,265220,"When you feel like throwing in the towel,"
g6BtbIiJ_rc,265245,268483,when you feel like surrendering everything you worked for
g6BtbIiJ_rc,268508,270610,"remember why you started,"
g6BtbIiJ_rc,270635,273365,"remember how you felt when you started,"
g6BtbIiJ_rc,273390,275159,you were hungry.
g6BtbIiJ_rc,276580,278103,"When you want to let go,"
g6BtbIiJ_rc,278128,279667,"when you want to surrender,"
g6BtbIiJ_rc,279922,281652,"when you want to stop,"
g6BtbIiJ_rc,281771,283573,"when you're ready to quit,"
g6BtbIiJ_rc,284366,287866,when you have failed and failed again.
g6BtbIiJ_rc,288311,291081,Let me remind you what got you here
g6BtbIiJ_rc,291612,293889,"hunger got you here,"
g6BtbIiJ_rc,293914,296906,a strong desire got you here.
g6BtbIiJ_rc,297200,300540,You were desperate to break curses in your family.
g6BtbIiJ_rc,300565,305279,You were desperate to break the cycle of poverty and depression.
g6BtbIiJ_rc,305304,308906,You were desperate. Hunger got you here.
g6BtbIiJ_rc,309709,311081,"Remember this,"
g6BtbIiJ_rc,311336,314700,every dream requires discipline.
g6BtbIiJ_rc,315098,317288,Every dream requires discipline.
g6BtbIiJ_rc,318367,320645,You can travel the world and study
g6BtbIiJ_rc,320709,324352,students and their behaviors and their mindsets
g6BtbIiJ_rc,324423,327248,there is a science behind achievement.
g6BtbIiJ_rc,327534,330860,And when you study the most successful students in the world
g6BtbIiJ_rc,331185,334256,"we find that they are responsible, they are motivated"
g6BtbIiJ_rc,334281,335994,"they are self-managed,"
g6BtbIiJ_rc,336431,338383,"they are self-aware,"
g6BtbIiJ_rc,338836,341685,they have a long-lasting student mentality
g6BtbIiJ_rc,341710,344367,even after they have passed the test
g6BtbIiJ_rc,345353,348511,because they understand that life is a test
g6BtbIiJ_rc,348734,351631,and in life there are ups and there are downs.
g6BtbIiJ_rc,352773,354575,"And so accept the responsibility,"
g6BtbIiJ_rc,354600,359710,see yourself as primarily responsible for your outcomes and your experiences.
g6BtbIiJ_rc,359997,362171,You are going to need discipline.
g6BtbIiJ_rc,362196,364632,Motivation will help you get started
g6BtbIiJ_rc,365775,368958,but discipline is going to keep you on the road to your destiny.
g6BtbIiJ_rc,369458,371379,You got to be self-motivated.
g6BtbIiJ_rc,371545,374355,You got to find purpose in what you do
g6BtbIiJ_rc,374380,377894,by discovering personally meaningful goals and dreams.
g6BtbIiJ_rc,379594,381856,"If you're going to be a successful student,"
g6BtbIiJ_rc,381881,386253,if you're going to come out on top you've got to start managing your time.
g6BtbIiJ_rc,387056,389523,You plan and you take action
g6BtbIiJ_rc,389595,391611,in pursuit of your goals and dreams.
g6BtbIiJ_rc,393270,395413,So let me tell you something everybody has a dream
g6BtbIiJ_rc,395438,399222,but there is a behavior that must follow your belief system.
g6BtbIiJ_rc,399374,400612,"Remember this,"
g6BtbIiJ_rc,400637,403731,behavior follows belief.
g6BtbIiJ_rc,404185,409794,If you have not been able to change your behavior
g6BtbIiJ_rc,409851,412089,to match your dream
g6BtbIiJ_rc,412328,416653,then you need to go back and examine your belief
g6BtbIiJ_rc,416947,418875,because 10 times out of 10
g6BtbIiJ_rc,418901,422154,if you can't change your behavior to match your dream
g6BtbIiJ_rc,422179,423559,then you don't believe.
g6BtbIiJ_rc,423584,427417,When somebody believes everything changes.
g6BtbIiJ_rc,429711,434044,The time is coming where you are going to feel like giving up
g6BtbIiJ_rc,434751,437386,but you're going to have to remember why you started.
g6BtbIiJ_rc,437743,441799,You got to dig deep and learn how to create possibilities for yourself
g6BtbIiJ_rc,442005,444282,when nobody gives you an opportunity.
g6BtbIiJ_rc,444402,447902,You have to turn your mess into your message.
