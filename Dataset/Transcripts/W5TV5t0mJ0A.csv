W5TV5t0mJ0A,0,2630,- Can the golden arches take down the king?
W5TV5t0mJ0A,2630,3819,- Let's talk about that.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,3819,6986,(gentle upbeat music)
W5TV5t0mJ0A,12150,13370,Good Mythical Morning.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,13370,17250,"- In the GMM extended food feud-iverse,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,17250,19520,"or GEFF, if you will,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,19520,21500,countless food behemoths have been
W5TV5t0mJ0A,21500,24950,pitted against one another in dramatic fashion.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,24950,28180,- But none of the battles have been as big as this one.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,28180,29752,McDonald's against-
W5TV5t0mJ0A,29752,30740,- Against.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,30740,31789,- Against-
W5TV5t0mJ0A,31790,32987,- Burger King.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,32987,33887,Dun dun dun.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,34940,36969,"- Yeah, we've had McDonald's versus Wendy's."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,36970,38990,We've had Burger King versus Jack in the Box.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,38990,39920,- Breakfast.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,39920,41667,"- But we've never had anything quite like this,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,41667,43980,"and it seems like the one that we would've started with,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,43980,45739,"but here we are, doing it now."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,45740,48020,The winners of the two past battles
W5TV5t0mJ0A,48020,49450,between Burger King and somebody else
W5TV5t0mJ0A,49450,51490,"and McDonald's and somebody else are now facing today,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,51490,52700,McDonald's and Burger King.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,52700,55080,"- All right, and these two fast food mega powers,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,55080,57760,"they don't go at each other that much on social media,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,57760,61406,but the fans of the two places do.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,61407,62637,"Vi tweeted,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,62637,64660,"""Burger King is just what your parents get"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,64660,66520,when they don't wanna fulfill your excitement
W5TV5t0mJ0A,66520,68050,"of getting McDonald's."""
W5TV5t0mJ0A,68051,68884,"- Oh, ow."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,68884,70407,"- Oh, that's a tough house to grow up in."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,70407,72176,"- T3ebetttt says,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,72177,74470,"""People who prefer McDonald's over Burger King"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,74470,77210,"have literally the worst taste buds."""
W5TV5t0mJ0A,77210,78387,"Okay, all right."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,78387,79810,You don't have to be so personal about it.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,79810,81697,"- And StefanFerrari said,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,81697,85450,"""Burger King is legit the boop and the king."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,85450,88670,Do yourself a favour and stop wasting your time
W5TV5t0mJ0A,88670,91670,"and money at McDonald's, like seriously."""
W5TV5t0mJ0A,91670,92950,"- Okay, strong words."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,92950,95670,So how will this fated feud come to an end?
W5TV5t0mJ0A,95670,98189,Will there be a tasty climax?
W5TV5t0mJ0A,98190,102490,- It's time for Food Feuds: McDonald's versus Burger King.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,102490,104070,We're gonna taste a pair of popular foods
W5TV5t0mJ0A,104070,105909,from both menus and rate 'em on a scale of one to 100.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,105910,106760,- Yep.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,106760,108480,- The fast food joint with the most points
W5TV5t0mJ0A,108480,110820,will be crowned the top rack fast food shack
W5TV5t0mJ0A,110820,112830,"and will win a chance to sponsor,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,112830,115410,"this is quite a honor, a future GMM episode."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,115410,117500,- And we're gonna get so healthy in the process.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,117500,118428,- Yes.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,118428,120160,(rock music riff)
W5TV5t0mJ0A,120160,121890,"Now, usually in these Food Feuds episodes,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,121890,125100,"we get actual employees from the restaurants to serve us,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,125100,127750,but apparently today we have the mascots.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,127750,128582,"- Oh, cool."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,131193,132200,Are you Ronald?
W5TV5t0mJ0A,132200,135050,"- I'm McAgent McMack,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,135050,138190,the detective who's been hunting down The Hamburglar
W5TV5t0mJ0A,138190,140120,for the last 30 years.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,140120,142900,"Every time I think he's within my grasp,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,142900,145549,he slips through my fingers.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,145550,148440,"Oh, as Ron is my witness,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,148440,152023,I will bury him under the McPrison.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,153200,154555,So that's a Big Mac.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,154555,156109,(Rhett laughing)
W5TV5t0mJ0A,156110,159940,"It's got two all beef patties, special sauce, onions,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,159940,160773,you know the song.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,160773,162230,"- Yeah, right, we know it."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,162231,163070,- For 5.89.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,163070,163903,- 5.89.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,163903,165431,"Well, the price has really gone up."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,165431,166264,- Wow.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,166264,167097,- Remember when you used to buy these.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,167097,168053,Oh.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,168053,169090,- There's a-
W5TV5t0mJ0A,169090,169922,- Hello.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,169923,170756,- Hi.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,170756,172300,"- I apologize that my husband could not make it today,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,172300,174250,so I am here in his stead.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,174250,177780,His face is busy being everyone's sleep paralysis demon.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,177780,179200,"- Oh, wow."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,179200,180650,- I am the burger queen.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,180650,181939,- Yes.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,181940,184420,- So this is our iconic Whopper.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,184420,188930,It's got a quarter pound of flame broiled beef
W5TV5t0mJ0A,188930,192769,"and lettuce, tomato, mayo, sliced onions,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,192770,195890,"and pickles, and it's 6.59, ta ta."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,195890,196722,- Okay.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,196723,197920,"- Okay, so first of all,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,197920,200550,I was expecting Ronald and the Burger King.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,200550,201580,"- Well, yes."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,201580,202910,- That's not what we got.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,202910,205710,"- It isn't, but we got us some drama."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,205710,207980,- [Rhett] We also have a singular sandwich
W5TV5t0mJ0A,207980,208847,for the two of us.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,208848,212070,"- Okay, well, I've removed all previous experience."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,212070,214623,"I don't even know what McDonald's, Burger King are."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,216960,218570,"- That's a good taste, y'all."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,218570,220340,I'm thinking I've already told you before.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,220340,221172,- [Link] Wow.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,221173,222440,- There was a special when I was in college
W5TV5t0mJ0A,222440,223950,"when those were five cents,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,223950,225680,and I bought about 20 of 'em
W5TV5t0mJ0A,225680,227200,and lived off of 'em for at least a week.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,227200,229599,- And I never would think you'd want a third slice
W5TV5t0mJ0A,229600,231400,of bread in the middle of the thing.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,231400,232400,"- I don't even think about it, though."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,232400,234629,"- But you don't even think about it and you kinda,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,234630,237193,"it really, it does a trick."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,238490,241650,This does not have cheese.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,241650,245640,They always add more mayonnaise than I think is needed.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,245640,246472,- I don't know.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,246473,248356,I'm a mayonnaise boy.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,248356,250090,"Just take, take, could you just take a bite?"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,250090,252970,- They're making us eat out of the same one this time.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,252970,255500,"- Yeah, well, I'm gonna not do what you did."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,255500,258290,I'm gonna like bite the back of the burger.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,258290,260870,"- Well, I didn't want to, I don't like biting the edge."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,260870,263290,That's why I went in further where you did.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,263290,266420,So you always have to remember to add cheese
W5TV5t0mJ0A,266420,269100,and take off the tomato.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,269100,270590,That doesn't have to happen here.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,270590,273680,- I can eat that without cheese and be satisfied.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,273680,274513,The thing about the Whopper
W5TV5t0mJ0A,274513,277040,"that's different than the Big Mac,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,277040,279960,the meat really sings on a Burger King burger
W5TV5t0mJ0A,279960,282449,if you like that flame broiled taste.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,282450,284020,- And it really does come through.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,284020,286740,"I mean, and they, there's a reason that they,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,286740,287800,that they push it.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,287800,289379,They both push it into marketing.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,289380,292360,- The Big Mac is sort of the quintessential
W5TV5t0mJ0A,292360,294646,"fast food hamburger that,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,294647,297400,"well the quintessential McHamburger, you know?"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,297400,299250,"It's not, I'm not gonna put it up against like Shake Shack"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,299250,300083,or something like that.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,300083,303100,"But I'm gonna say, I'm gonna give it a solid eight."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,303100,304590,- I was thinking the same thing.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,304590,306199,I'm gonna give it an eight.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,306200,307033,I love it.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,308271,311169,"Over here, I have to modify things according to my taste"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,311170,315670,"but the flame broil of it all, and it's big."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,315670,317160,- I'm going with a seven on the Whopper.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,317160,319000,- I'm gonna give it a six.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,319000,320510,"- Okay, all right."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,320510,323170,- What is that a total of? 14?
W5TV5t0mJ0A,323170,324220,- You don't have to do the math.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,324220,325490,- Great.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,325490,327410,(rock music riff)
W5TV5t0mJ0A,327410,328667,Is it chicken time?
W5TV5t0mJ0A,328667,329763,- Hello.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,329764,330597,- Yes.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,330597,332250,- I'm so used to being waited on.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,332250,335830,This is a very humbling experience and I hate it.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,335830,337699,This is the Ch'King.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,337700,342360,"It is a crispy hand battered fried chicken, and pickles,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,342360,346787,and signature sauce on a toasted potato bun for 5.39.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,346787,347620,- Ooh.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,347620,348580,Let me rip it out here.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,348580,350179,"Oh yeah, they cut it for us."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,350179,351498,- They cut this on in half for us.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,351498,353000,"- Oh, they cut it, that's great."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,353000,357640,This is the Crispy Chicken Sandwich with crispy chicken
W5TV5t0mJ0A,357640,362640,and also pickles and a potato roll for 5.19.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,362910,364920,I have a digitally aged projection
W5TV5t0mJ0A,364920,366507,of what he may look like now.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,367470,370130,The Hamburglar is now much older
W5TV5t0mJ0A,370130,372660,and I think he might look something like that.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,372660,373750,"- Ah, wow."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,373750,376210,"Strangely familiar, strangely familiar."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,376210,377060,- Tell me if you see him.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,377060,379110,- [Link] His chin got a lot bigger.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,379110,380567,- [Rhett] Yeah.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,380567,381400,- [Link] His head got longer.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,381400,383190,- His face got narrower and his teeth grew
W5TV5t0mJ0A,383190,386250,from one or two to many.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,386250,387170,"- Other than that, yeah."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,387170,388600,This seems pretty accurate.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,388600,389590,- Spittin' image.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,389590,391050,- We'll let you know.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,391050,391883,- Okay.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,391883,392716,- Okay.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,392716,395530,We recently did the spicy chicken sandwich
W5TV5t0mJ0A,395530,396790,taste test on this show
W5TV5t0mJ0A,396790,399460,and McDonald's actually was last place
W5TV5t0mJ0A,399460,401087,and Burger King was first place.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,401087,403570,And this is a blind taste test.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,403570,404403,But you know what?
W5TV5t0mJ0A,404403,406320,We're trying to put that out of our minds.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,406320,407280,Every sandwich is different.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,407280,408590,Every sandwich maker is different.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,408590,410120,- And this is not spicy.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,410120,411139,This is unspicy.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,411140,412050,- It's just a regular chicken sandwich.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,412050,414509,"- Yeah, we didn't get to look at it before."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,414510,416170,I'll bite to the middle here.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,416170,417553,- [Rhett] I'll bite to the middle.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,419180,421080,- [Link] Where is the crunch?
W5TV5t0mJ0A,421080,422319,- The chicken.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,422320,424080,- [Link] Where's the taste?
W5TV5t0mJ0A,424080,426210,- I don't think it's bad.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,426210,427043,It's just-
W5TV5t0mJ0A,427043,427876,- Say something good about it.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,427876,428790,- [Rhett] It's just not good.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,428790,429623,- Mm-hmm.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,429623,430456,"I mean, look at the,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,430456,433587,look at the crunchy outcroppings on this thing.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,433587,435100,- [Rhett] And it comes with a special sauce.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,435100,437563,"- I mean, they really took notes from Popeyes."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,439003,441699,(Rhett crunching)
W5TV5t0mJ0A,441700,443110,Oh my goodness.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,443110,444929,- It's a good sandwich.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,444929,447960,"- You got a nice, crunchy edge."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,447960,450789,The bun is just poppin'.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,450790,452570,"- The bread's better, the chicken's better."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,452570,454163,"- [Link] And the sauce, what is that?"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,454163,454996,- [Rhett] The sauce is great.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,454996,457320,I'm putting this on the scale from one to 10
W5TV5t0mJ0A,457320,460600,"of the new sort of the new era of chicken sandwiches,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,460600,461650,"and so with that in mind,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,461650,463889,I'm giving this one a four.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,463890,465290,- I'm gonna give it a three.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,467240,470030,"I'm gonna go over here and yeah,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,470030,471530,I'm missing the spiciness
W5TV5t0mJ0A,471530,476070,"but I think I gotta give this a nice, solid seven."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,476070,478160,"- That's what I was gonna say, seven for Burger King."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,478160,479998,"Okay, well Burger King just-"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,479998,480831,- I feel good about that.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,480831,482266,- Just took a little chunk out.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,482266,484400,(rock music riff)
W5TV5t0mJ0A,484400,485233,What's that smell?
W5TV5t0mJ0A,485233,486910,That's not beef. That's not chicken.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,486910,487953,- It's fish.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,488893,491233,This is the Filet-O-Fish.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,491233,496233,"It's got fish, cheese, tartar sauce on a bun for 5.19."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,497831,499570,Have you seen him?
W5TV5t0mJ0A,499571,500590,Have you seen him?
W5TV5t0mJ0A,500590,501423,"- No, I haven't."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,501423,502620,- I think I have.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,502620,503453,- Really?
W5TV5t0mJ0A,503453,504521,"- Yeah, we'll talk about it later."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,504521,505691,"- You have to tell me, okay?"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,505691,506524,"- Okay, yep."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,506524,508580,- No one is above McDonald law!
W5TV5t0mJ0A,508580,511030,- I'm so glad I live above the law.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,511030,513965,I've committed all the crimes except for one big one.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,513965,515110,- Oh yeah?
W5TV5t0mJ0A,515110,515943,- Yes.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,515943,517310,- Which is?
W5TV5t0mJ0A,517310,519759,"- You know, what's it called when you get a huntsman"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,519760,521210,to go chase your stepdaughter
W5TV5t0mJ0A,521210,522719,"who's prettier than you into the woods,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,522719,524181,never to be seen again?
W5TV5t0mJ0A,524182,525819,"- Yeah, that, that old one."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,525819,526899,- I'm working on it.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,526899,527732,- That old one.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,527732,529220,"- Anyway, this is the Big Fish!"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,529220,530053,- Murderer.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,530053,533380,"It's 100% white Alaskan pollock,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,533380,535650,"breaded and fried with pickles,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,535650,538220,"tartar sauce on a brioche style bun,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,538220,539750,"for which I don't know what the,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,539750,541580,it's either brioche or not.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,541580,543420,"It's 5.99, bye bye."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,543420,544253,"- Okay, so-"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,544253,545100,- The Filet-O-Fish-
W5TV5t0mJ0A,545100,545940,- [Link] Has cheese.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,545940,549730,- Has cheese but it has like one half slice
W5TV5t0mJ0A,549730,551480,of cheese that goes across it.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,551480,552532,"- Well, where is the cheese?"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,552533,553950,- It's on my side.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,553950,557210,"- I didn't get any of the, I got that much of the cheese."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,557210,559100,"- Yeah, you get a little bit of cheese."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,559100,562250,"Here, I'll rip this in half if you want a cheesy bite."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,562250,564550,"- Yeah, I want to give it, I wanna, thank you."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,565490,569070,"And over here, there is no cheese, but there's lettuce."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,569070,571010,- [Rhett] And is that mayonnaise or tartar sauce?
W5TV5t0mJ0A,571010,571843,- [Link] Tartar sauce.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,571843,573008,- [Rhett] Okay.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,573008,573841,- [Link] I believe.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,573841,576293,"- Now, Filet-O-Fish, available all the time."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,577350,578324,"In the past,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,578325,581450,the Big Fish has only been available at a limited time.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,581450,582360,It's available right now.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,582360,583890,"I don't know if it's gonna be sticking around,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,583890,586048,but it's available now so we're tasting it.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,586048,587500,- [Link] Hmm.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,587500,588390,- I like a Filet-O-Fish.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,588390,589900,"I hardly ever get it, though."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,589900,591143,- Cheesy fish sticks.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,592140,593310,Hmm.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,593310,595960,It's not a great experience to me.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,595960,596793,- Well.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,596793,599240,"- I mean, there's so much to tempt you on the menu."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,599240,601066,This is like the last thing I would order.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,601066,602769,- That's why I don't get it.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,602770,605720,"Now Stevie, Cassie will order this straight up, right?"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,605720,607250,Like this is her go-to.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,607250,608650,- [Stevie] Straight up.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,608650,609770,"Oh, not straight up, though."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,609770,612800,"With an extra, with an added piece of cheese."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,612800,613750,"- In order to get one,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,613750,615420,she does it to get one whole piece of cheese.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,615420,616290,"- [Stevie] Yeah, yeah, yeah."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,616290,617320,- [Link] And so they make it fresh.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,617320,618153,- [Stevie] I like it.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,618153,619411,I'm into it.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,619411,622053,"I haven't had the Burger King one, though."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,622053,622949,"- Well, here it is."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,622950,624450,- No cheese on it.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,625430,627770,"- Wow, that's pretty good."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,627770,629220,- I wish it had cheese.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,629220,630470,"- I would definitely order it with cheese,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,630470,632629,but the fish is better.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,632630,634080,"- Yeah, you can see that the fish"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,634080,637730,has more space between the flakes.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,637730,640029,It's more space flaked.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,640030,642020,- [Rhett] It's more realistic fish.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,642020,645490,"- It is dramatically better in terms of taste,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,645490,648010,in terms of mouth feel.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,648010,649220,- I still like it.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,649220,650509,I'm going with six.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,650510,653500,"- Oh, I'm gonna try to be generous"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,653500,655480,'cause the tartar sauce ain't bad.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,655480,656930,I'll give it a two.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,656930,658450,- Oh my gosh.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,658450,660410,"- It's just, it was just not good."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,660410,662300,- This is actually significantly better.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,662300,665560,I can imagine a better fish sandwich.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,665560,666393,"- Oh, you can't?"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,666393,667641,- I said I can.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,667641,670709,- I can imagine a better fish sandwich.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,670710,672350,Don't misquote me now.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,672350,673339,- Right.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,673340,675140,"- But I'm gonna, I'm giving an eight,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,675140,676790,"which is very, very high."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,676790,677810,- I'm gonna give it a five
W5TV5t0mJ0A,677810,679910,because I was very surprised by it.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,679910,680925,- Uh-oh.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,680926,682660,(rock music riff)
W5TV5t0mJ0A,682660,683860,"Watching us eat all this stuff,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,683860,685070,"you might be thinking to yourself,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,685070,687800,I'm thinking about making a burger at home.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,687800,689130,"Well, check out sporked.com"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,689130,691610,to find out which burger buns you should buy.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,691610,693690,"Also, the Sporked team ranked the best ketchups"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,693690,695541,with help from Mythical Chef Josh.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,695541,696374,- [Link] Whoop.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,696374,697509,- And be sure to follow sport on socials everywhere
W5TV5t0mJ0A,697509,699930,to watch behind the scenes footage
W5TV5t0mJ0A,699930,701454,of the team's actual taste tests.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,701454,703813,And there's a T-shirt too.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,703814,705050,"- Next time I do this,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,705050,707333,I'm getting the burger prime minister.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,707333,708930,I don't want to do this ever again.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,708930,709888,- This is tough.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,709888,710721,Tough for you.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,710721,712840,"- You know, I think someone's looking for you."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,712840,713803,- Me?
W5TV5t0mJ0A,715150,717810,- You've got the queen in on this.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,717810,722690,"- These are McDonald's medium fries, 3.79."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,722690,724124,- All right.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,724124,724957,"- Let me just, thank you."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,724957,725790,"- Okay, sure."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,725790,726623,"- Yeah, help yourself."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,726623,727456,- You're entitled to it.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,727456,728289,- I'm a crooked cop.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,728289,729980,(crew laughing)
W5TV5t0mJ0A,729980,732070,"- All right, so the fries."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,732070,733920,- Do you have preconceived notions about this?
W5TV5t0mJ0A,733920,736980,"- The skinny, floppy ones are my favorite"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,736980,739790,and I always eat them all before my burger.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,739790,742070,"- McDonald's got fries right a long time ago,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,742070,743950,like when I was a child.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,743950,744790,They never changed.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,744790,745623,- No need to change it.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,745623,746850,"Burger King, they did some changes."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,746850,748860,"- They've tried so many things at Burger King,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,748860,750360,which is a sign of weakness.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,750360,752899,- I love a little skinny fry
W5TV5t0mJ0A,752900,755280,and I like getting the little crunchy ones
W5TV5t0mJ0A,755280,756670,and then the long floppy.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,756670,758540,"- Well, let's see what Burger King is doing these days"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,758540,760180,'cause I don't think I even know anymore.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,760180,761570,- I remember when they changed-
W5TV5t0mJ0A,761570,762403,- That's a big 'un.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,762403,766160,- Theirs in the 90s and they became crunchier.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,766160,766993,- [Rhett] Too crunchy.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,766993,768199,"- And the flavor switched,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,768200,770428,but the flavor was really good.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,770428,771550,- Hmm.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,771550,773070,- I think they've stayed the same since then
W5TV5t0mJ0A,773070,774910,because this is how I remember it.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,774910,777970,"- No, they've gotten, they've gone, they've gone back."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,777970,779040,- [Link] These are a good flavor.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,779040,781870,"They're more, you remember that they're potatoes."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,781870,785008,- I don't think I want to know that they're potatoes.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,785008,785841,Is that weird?
W5TV5t0mJ0A,785841,786780,"- McDonald's fries, again,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,786780,788900,"like everything else at McDonald's, is its own thing."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,788900,791940,- They've de-potatofied the potato.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,791940,793240,- Go bold or go home.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,793240,797070,I'm giving these fries a proud nine.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,797070,798720,- There's a part of me that wants to go all the way to 10
W5TV5t0mJ0A,798720,799845,but I'm not gonna do it-
W5TV5t0mJ0A,799846,800679,- [Link] I know.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,800679,802720,"- 'Cause I can imagine a better fry, nine."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,802720,805149,"- I know, maybe we should give it a 10."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,805150,808150,"I just, I mean, what other fast food fry"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,808150,810080,is better than a McDonald's fry?
W5TV5t0mJ0A,810080,811080,- There probably is one.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,811080,812330,We just haven't had it.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,812330,813163,"I mean like I haven't had,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,813163,815240,like I haven't really thought about Five Guys fries.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,815240,816910,They got the potato bags all around the place.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,816910,820509,- We reserve the right to list a higher fry.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,820510,821440,"These aren't bad, though."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,821440,822390,I respect what they're doing.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,822390,824040,They're a little too fat for my taste
W5TV5t0mJ0A,824040,826329,but I do like the taste.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,826330,827163,- Agreed.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,827163,828960,I'm gonna give 'em a solid seven 'cause this is-
W5TV5t0mJ0A,828960,829793,"- That's what I was thinking, seven."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,829793,830671,- It's a great fry.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,830671,832360,- Seven from us.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,832360,833480,- All right.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,833481,835361,(rock music riff)
W5TV5t0mJ0A,835361,836593,- What we got next?
W5TV5t0mJ0A,837620,840170,"- McDonald's four piece chicken nuggets,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,840170,844670,all white meat chicken and barbecue sauce for 2.19.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,844670,846000,- That's a little bit of chicken.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,846000,847563,- I miss my family!
W5TV5t0mJ0A,849090,849990,- He's dedicated his life.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,849990,851046,- I do not-
W5TV5t0mJ0A,851046,852249,- Hard workin'
W5TV5t0mJ0A,852249,853340,- Miss my family.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,853340,855250,"Every time I try to be intimate with my husband,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,855250,857114,he just looks at me like this.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,857114,858250,(Rhett laughing)
W5TV5t0mJ0A,858250,859600,Imagine.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,859600,861420,This is our four piece chicken nuggets
W5TV5t0mJ0A,861420,863722,"and with barbecue sauce, 1.29."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,865240,866073,- In a sack?
W5TV5t0mJ0A,866073,868231,"They put 'em, they give 'em to you in a sack now?"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,868231,869550,- They got a chicken sack.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,869550,870390,- [Queen] In a sack!
W5TV5t0mJ0A,870390,871810,- They've done a lot of different things
W5TV5t0mJ0A,871810,873301,"at Burger King with their,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,873301,875310,they've tried so many things.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,875310,876340,- Lots of shapes.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,876340,878150,- It's almost like they have a mentality
W5TV5t0mJ0A,878150,880540,"that they're behind McDonald's and trying to compete,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,880540,881970,and they keep changing things up
W5TV5t0mJ0A,881970,885600,to try to like meet that standard or something?
W5TV5t0mJ0A,885600,886680,But I think they're holding their own
W5TV5t0mJ0A,886680,887800,in a lot of ways today.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,887800,889690,- I've said it before.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,889690,891690,"You've heard it, but I have to say it again."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,891690,893040,A McNugget is not a nugget.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,895470,896556,- It's a McNugget.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,896556,897460,- It is a McNugget.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,897460,901411,"It has its own distinct, everything about it."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,901411,902650,You know?
W5TV5t0mJ0A,902650,904120,"- It is so good, man."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,904120,904953,- So it's like-
W5TV5t0mJ0A,904953,906330,- If you're expecting a piece of chicken-
W5TV5t0mJ0A,906330,907720,"- Yeah, if you're in the mood for nuggets,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,907720,908850,you're not gonna order a McNugget.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,908850,910130,"But if you're in the move for a McNugget,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,910130,911860,ain't nothing else that can quench that thirst.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,911860,915490,"- Man, listen, it was after midnight the other night"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,915490,918300,"and I was, me and the boys were on the road,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,918300,920560,"and I was like, y'all feeling like a 20 piece?"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,920560,921393,You know what I'm saying?
W5TV5t0mJ0A,921393,923040,"It's just like, that happens sometimes."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,923040,923930,"And of course,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,923930,925890,"whenever you throw that out in the McLaughlin car,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,925890,927190,"everybody's like, well, yes."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,927190,930850,- I just think it triggers so many childhood memories.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,930850,932029,Most of which are good.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,932030,935330,- The feel of a Burger King nugget is already different.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,935330,937050,"Less, I can tell that it's not gonna be crispy,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,937050,938350,just by picking it up.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,938350,940170,It's a little bit rubbery almost.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,940170,941760,- [Link] Yeah.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,941760,943363,Their sauce is dark.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,945290,947100,- They have a distinct thing going on too.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,947100,948190,You know what I'm saying?
W5TV5t0mJ0A,948190,951230,- Even the meat feels like breading.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,951230,953829,- There's more breading on a McDonald's McNugget
W5TV5t0mJ0A,954990,956388,and the crispiness.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,956388,958160,- And a McNugget is kind of like a shell
W5TV5t0mJ0A,958160,960329,that you kind of like break through.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,960330,961470,- [Rhett] That's not a bad nugget.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,961470,963269,"- [Link] No, it's not."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,963270,964470,"- It's not this, though."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,965330,966163,I don't know.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,966163,969770,"I'm only ranking this on a scale of fast food nuggets,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,969770,971460,not like little pieces of chicken.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,971460,973300,- I'm gonna give a McNugget an eight.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,973300,975709,- Eight is what I was gonna say.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,975710,977760,"- And this thing is decent, you know?"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,977760,979850,"Ain't no shame in this and if you get it,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,979850,981750,you're not gonna be complaining
W5TV5t0mJ0A,981750,983930,but you're not gonna remember it either.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,983930,987167,It's not gonna hold a special place in your psyche
W5TV5t0mJ0A,987167,989668,for your entire life.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,989668,990580,- I don't know about this.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,990580,991686,I feel like-
W5TV5t0mJ0A,991686,992519,- Six.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,992519,993670,"- I feel, I still, I was gonna go five,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,993670,997066,but I still like it so I'm gonna go six as well.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,997067,999310,(rock music riff)
W5TV5t0mJ0A,999310,1001529,"All right, let's wrap things up with dessert."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1001530,1002363,- Yes.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1002363,1003196,- Hello.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1003196,1006779,This is our Oreo cookie shake for 4.39
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1006780,1009993,with real Oreo cookie bits in there and whatnot.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1009993,1011003,- All right.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1011003,1014020,"- Oh, angry man."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1014020,1016393,There is a note someone gave me for you.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1019130,1021300,- I'm right under your nose this whole time.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1021300,1022769,You'll never catch me alive.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1022770,1024623,Rabble rabble rubble rubble.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1025750,1027610,He can't keep winning.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1027610,1031173,This is an Oreo McFlurry vanilla.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1032030,1033110,- Un.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1033110,1035250,"- You'll love it, you'll be great."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1035250,1036343,- He said this is un.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1039400,1040583,He's a hard working guy.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1040583,1041889,- Yeah.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1041889,1042890,- He's flustered.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1042890,1044339,- He'll never catch me.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1044339,1045819,"- He can't, he can't find him."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1045819,1047142,- Oh goodness.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1047142,1048789,- A McFlurry has a special spoon.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1048790,1051960,"- [Link] What is happening with this, this top?"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1051960,1053732,"- It's chock full of flavor, man."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1055360,1056423,- Good gracious.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1057770,1058670,- Mm.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1058670,1059503,- Mm.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1059503,1061764,"- [Rhett] McFlurry is a solid, solid dessert."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1061764,1065420,- That is a good flavored ice cream.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1065420,1068210,"- And the method by which you consume it,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1068210,1069929,which is the spoon method
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1069930,1071930,and the spoon meets a straw method.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1071930,1072960,- [Link] Why is it hollow?
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1072960,1074099,Is that because-
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1074099,1074932,- [Rhett] So you can suck on it.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1074932,1076610,"- Oh, oh my crap."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1076610,1077460,You can?
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1077460,1080340,- [Stevie] That's what they used to blend it.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1080340,1081173,They attached to the top.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1081173,1082006,- That's right.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1082006,1083096,- [Stevie] Yeah.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1083096,1084047,- I remember that now.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1084047,1085780,"You don't, put you puff this."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1085780,1088130,"- I mean, theoretically, if you let it melt"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1088130,1089380,and then you did this-
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1089380,1090380,"- Well, this is a straw."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1090380,1091780,"- And you bit off the end of it,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1091780,1093180,you could use it as a straw.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1096882,1099549,(crew laughing)
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1101910,1104560,- This doesn't even taste right after tasting that.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1104560,1105910,- I agree with you that initially
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1105910,1107920,"there was an off putting flavor,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1107920,1111230,but think milkshake and not ice cream with something in it.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1111230,1112063,- Yeah.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1112063,1114809,"- I mean, it's not great, but it's not bad once you get"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1114810,1116536,into the milkshake head space.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1116536,1119550,- It's not great.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1119550,1120740,"And when I go back to this,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1120740,1123600,does this negatively impact this?
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1123600,1124450,- Let's find out.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1125500,1126870,- [Link] Not in the slightest.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1126870,1128000,"It's just, it tastes-"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1128000,1129140,- [Rhett] This is an ice cream treat.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1129140,1130683,- So much better.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1131700,1132732,It's so much better.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1133650,1137330,I'm going to give this a lot of points.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1137330,1140029,It's going to be around eight.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1140030,1141620,- This is super solid.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1141620,1143990,"I'm kind of hovering between an eight and a nine, actually."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1143990,1145840,But I'm gonna go eight as well.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1145840,1146950,"This on the other hand,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1146950,1150010,"not as good by a long shot, but again,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1150010,1151950,if you go to the milkshake place
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1151950,1153950,"and you were just thinking cookies and cream milkshake,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1153950,1155360,I'd give it a five.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1155360,1156530,I'll go to a five.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1156530,1157980,"I don't, I'm not hating on it."
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1157980,1160650,- I'm gonna give it a four and that's the best I can do.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1160650,1163500,So take that.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1163500,1167380,- So that brings us to McDonald's with a total score of 81
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1167380,1169770,to Burger King with 75.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1169770,1174770,"So hey, pretty close matchup but McDonald's got a pretty,"
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1175050,1176890,pretty healthy victory here.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1176890,1179840,- You won a chance to sponsor a GMM episode.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1179840,1181263,- Was it ever in doubt for you?
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1181264,1182200,- Was that a word?
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1182200,1183960,It was never in doubt for me.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1183960,1185970,- I thought that Burger King might have a better showing
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1185970,1187270,but you know what?
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1187270,1188103,They just didn't.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1188103,1190270,Those fries and the milkshake really put 'em over the top.
W5TV5t0mJ0A,1190270,1191103,- Yeah.
