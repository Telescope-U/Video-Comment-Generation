txCYa0xuL-E,2879,5200,challenge versus threat it's not the
txCYa0xuL-E,5200,7279,same even if the magnitude of the
txCYa0xuL-E,7279,9280,problem is the same and so putting
txCYa0xuL-E,9280,11040,yourself in a challenging let's call it
txCYa0xuL-E,11040,12960,mind frame you can't just do that by
txCYa0xuL-E,12960,15120,magic putting yourself in a challenging
txCYa0xuL-E,15120,17680,mind frame is much bet much easier on
txCYa0xuL-E,17680,19279,you psychophysiologically because you
txCYa0xuL-E,19279,20880,don't produce you don't go into the
txCYa0xuL-E,20880,22880,generalized stress response to the same
txCYa0xuL-E,22880,24560,degree and you're activating your
txCYa0xuL-E,24560,26560,exploratory and seeking systems which
txCYa0xuL-E,26560,28640,are dopaminergically mediated and that
txCYa0xuL-E,28640,31760,involve positive emotion so if you can
txCYa0xuL-E,31760,33600,face something voluntarily rather than
txCYa0xuL-E,33600,35920,having it chase you it's way better for
txCYa0xuL-E,35920,37920,you psychophysiologically
txCYa0xuL-E,37920,38800,so
txCYa0xuL-E,38800,40800,that's partly why while it's worthwhile
txCYa0xuL-E,40800,43040,to go find the dragon in its lair
txCYa0xuL-E,43040,44640,instead of waiting for it to come and
txCYa0xuL-E,44640,45760,eat you
txCYa0xuL-E,45760,47840,so and especially when you also add the
txCYa0xuL-E,47840,49680,idea that if you go find the dragon in
txCYa0xuL-E,49680,51680,its lair you might find it when it's a
txCYa0xuL-E,51680,53760,baby instead of a full-fledged bloody
txCYa0xuL-E,53760,55600,monster that is definitely going to take
txCYa0xuL-E,55600,56559,you down
txCYa0xuL-E,56559,59440,and so that's part of the reason why
txCYa0xuL-E,59440,60719,well there's a whole bunch of things
txCYa0xuL-E,60719,61920,that that
txCYa0xuL-E,61920,64640,that emerge out of that observation like
txCYa0xuL-E,64640,67040,don't avoid small problems that you know
txCYa0xuL-E,67040,68320,are there
txCYa0xuL-E,68320,70320,face them because they'll grow into big
txCYa0xuL-E,70320,72720,problems all by themselves and you can
txCYa0xuL-E,72720,74799,think about imagine the tax department
txCYa0xuL-E,74799,77040,sends you a notification you owe them
txCYa0xuL-E,77040,79600,like 300 dollars well it's
txCYa0xuL-E,79600,81520,you know that's annoying maybe you don't
txCYa0xuL-E,81520,83600,even want to open the letter or maybe if
txCYa0xuL-E,83600,85439,you do you just put it on the shelf but
txCYa0xuL-E,85439,87040,that damn thing doesn't just sit there
txCYa0xuL-E,87040,89200,like a piece of paper on the shelf right
txCYa0xuL-E,89200,91439,you ignore that for five or six years
txCYa0xuL-E,91439,93280,it's going to become attached to all
txCYa0xuL-E,93280,94880,sorts of horrible things and if you
txCYa0xuL-E,94880,97200,ignore it long enough you get the idea
txCYa0xuL-E,97200,98880,it's going to turn into something that
txCYa0xuL-E,98880,100960,is completely unlike the little piece of
txCYa0xuL-E,100960,103759,paper that it's written on and and many
txCYa0xuL-E,103759,105439,many problems in life are like that
txCYa0xuL-E,105439,107920,you'll see they'll you'll see that
txCYa0xuL-E,107920,109680,they pop their ugly little head up and
txCYa0xuL-E,109680,111680,you know and you might want to turn away
txCYa0xuL-E,111680,113200,you might not want
txCYa0xuL-E,113200,115360,not want to think about it which is the
txCYa0xuL-E,115360,116880,easiest way of turning away right you
txCYa0xuL-E,116880,118560,just don't attend to it it's not like
txCYa0xuL-E,118560,120880,you repress it or anything like that you
txCYa0xuL-E,120880,123520,just fail to attend to it and
txCYa0xuL-E,123520,125840,that's a really as a long-term strategy
txCYa0xuL-E,125840,128239,it's dismal it's also something i think
txCYa0xuL-E,128239,130000,that's more characteristic of people who
txCYa0xuL-E,130000,131680,are high in neuroticism and high in
txCYa0xuL-E,131680,133200,agreeableness because agreeable people
txCYa0xuL-E,133200,135599,don't like conflict and people who are
txCYa0xuL-E,135599,137360,high in neuroticism or high negative
txCYa0xuL-E,137360,140160,emotion are hit harder per unit of
txCYa0xuL-E,140160,143120,uncertainty or threat and so
txCYa0xuL-E,143120,144480,you know and that's partly why in
txCYa0xuL-E,144480,146239,psychotherapy a lot of times the people
txCYa0xuL-E,146239,148000,you see need assertiveness training so
txCYa0xuL-E,148000,149040,that would be the opposite of
txCYa0xuL-E,149040,150400,agreeableness or
txCYa0xuL-E,150400,152239,they need to help get their anxiety and
txCYa0xuL-E,152239,154319,emotional pain under control it's those
txCYa0xuL-E,154319,155599,are not the only reasons there's
txCYa0xuL-E,155599,157440,antisocial behavior but you can't fix
txCYa0xuL-E,157440,159040,that in therapy in all likelihood
txCYa0xuL-E,159040,160879,there's alcoholism there's lots and lots
txCYa0xuL-E,160879,162560,of other reasons but those are two major
txCYa0xuL-E,162560,164959,reasons
txCYa0xuL-E,167599,170239,i bought this cottage up north in
txCYa0xuL-E,170239,172480,northern canada and it's very dark up
txCYa0xuL-E,172480,173440,there
txCYa0xuL-E,173440,175519,and you can go on to the dock at night
txCYa0xuL-E,175519,176720,and
txCYa0xuL-E,176720,177920,it's dark enough so you can see the
txCYa0xuL-E,177920,179519,milky way you know and it has to be
txCYa0xuL-E,179519,180959,pretty dark before you can see the milky
txCYa0xuL-E,180959,182480,way and it's very impressive you know
txCYa0xuL-E,182480,184159,what that's like if you you know to see
txCYa0xuL-E,184159,185920,the night sky or maybe you see feel the
txCYa0xuL-E,185920,187599,same way when you see the grand canyon
txCYa0xuL-E,187599,190720,or a remarkable waterfall or some
txCYa0xuL-E,190720,192800,particularly beautiful scene or perhaps
txCYa0xuL-E,192800,195200,you feel that way in a cathedral or more
txCYa0xuL-E,195200,196720,likely you feel that way when you're
txCYa0xuL-E,196720,198640,listening to music that really grips you
txCYa0xuL-E,198640,200959,right it's all the same experience and
txCYa0xuL-E,200959,203599,experience of all and it's way down low
txCYa0xuL-E,203599,204959,in your nervous system like the
txCYa0xuL-E,204959,208080,orienting reflexes it's not a cognitive
txCYa0xuL-E,208080,210480,response precisely it's a precognitive
txCYa0xuL-E,210480,213840,emotional response that's that signifies
txCYa0xuL-E,213840,215280,significance
txCYa0xuL-E,215280,217519,and you look up at the night sky
txCYa0xuL-E,217519,219840,and it fills you with a sense of awe but
txCYa0xuL-E,219840,221519,it doesn't just do that you see it it
txCYa0xuL-E,221519,223200,activates the
txCYa0xuL-E,223200,225519,the impulse to imitate which is a very
txCYa0xuL-E,225519,228000,deep motivation in human beings we're
txCYa0xuL-E,228000,230239,unbelievable mimics we mimic each other
txCYa0xuL-E,230239,232319,all the time which is why we all use the
txCYa0xuL-E,232319,235040,same words let's say
txCYa0xuL-E,235040,236720,we're very good at embodying other
txCYa0xuL-E,236720,238879,people's embodiments it's a particular
txCYa0xuL-E,238879,240879,talent that human beings have and we're
txCYa0xuL-E,240879,242560,so good at that we imitate all sorts of
txCYa0xuL-E,242560,244959,things that aren't even human
txCYa0xuL-E,244959,246239,and so then you
txCYa0xuL-E,246239,249360,you view this expansive night sky
txCYa0xuL-E,249360,250159,and
txCYa0xuL-E,250159,253439,a sense of awe fills you as you confront
txCYa0xuL-E,253439,254470,the infinite
txCYa0xuL-E,254470,258750,[Music]
txCYa0xuL-E,259199,262079,it calls to something inside of you that
txCYa0xuL-E,262079,264720,can master the infinite
txCYa0xuL-E,264720,266639,and that's a form of imitation right to
txCYa0xuL-E,266639,269199,look into the darkest place
txCYa0xuL-E,269199,270639,the most
txCYa0xuL-E,270639,271600,wide
txCYa0xuL-E,271600,273919,expanse possible
txCYa0xuL-E,273919,276560,and to have something inside you respond
txCYa0xuL-E,276560,279600,that's capable of dealing with that
txCYa0xuL-E,279600,281919,that's that instinct to imitate and
txCYa0xuL-E,281919,283840,that's calling the best out of you and
txCYa0xuL-E,283840,285680,that's why you love doing that and it
txCYa0xuL-E,285680,287120,isn't just that you love it is that you
txCYa0xuL-E,287120,289280,cannot live without it you cannot live
txCYa0xuL-E,289280,290400,without it
txCYa0xuL-E,290400,292720,and i know so many of you atheist or
txCYa0xuL-E,292720,293759,otherwise
txCYa0xuL-E,293759,297199,you can't live without music i think why
txCYa0xuL-E,297199,299680,can you not live without music
txCYa0xuL-E,299680,303039,what is it calling to precisely you know
txCYa0xuL-E,303039,306160,that remarkable interplay of harmonious
txCYa0xuL-E,306160,308080,patterns because that's what music is
txCYa0xuL-E,308080,309600,and that's what the world is it's not
txCYa0xuL-E,309600,312080,objects it's the harmonious interplay of
txCYa0xuL-E,312080,314080,patterns and music reflects that and
txCYa0xuL-E,314080,316320,then you warrant yourself in your
txCYa0xuL-E,316320,317520,embodied
txCYa0xuL-E,317520,320560,manner to those patterns and dance
txCYa0xuL-E,320560,323120,along with the world and that revivifies
txCYa0xuL-E,323120,324479,you and if you're particularly good at
txCYa0xuL-E,324479,326960,well maybe you'll also attract a mate
txCYa0xuL-E,326960,329840,and you want a mate that doesn't detect
txCYa0xuL-E,329840,332320,attempt to dominate you sexually during
txCYa0xuL-E,332320,334800,the introductory dance right you want a
txCYa0xuL-E,334800,337039,mate who will play along with you and
txCYa0xuL-E,337039,338960,match your movements to theirs so that
txCYa0xuL-E,338960,340479,you can see that there's a harmonious
txCYa0xuL-E,340479,341759,interplay
txCYa0xuL-E,341759,344080,between the two of you as you meet in
txCYa0xuL-E,344080,344960,play
txCYa0xuL-E,344960,348400,soul to soul if you can manage it
txCYa0xuL-E,348400,350639,and everyone knows that
txCYa0xuL-E,350639,352720,and that capacity that's called out in
txCYa0xuL-E,352720,354479,the dance is the same capacity that's
txCYa0xuL-E,354479,356319,called out by the night sky and it's the
txCYa0xuL-E,356319,358479,same thing that's represented in those
txCYa0xuL-E,358479,360639,byzantine churches
txCYa0xuL-E,360639,363440,you look deep enough into infinity and
txCYa0xuL-E,363440,365199,you find your destiny
txCYa0xuL-E,365199,367039,and that destiny is everything you could
txCYa0xuL-E,367039,368479,be
txCYa0xuL-E,368479,370560,and we all know that because and this is
txCYa0xuL-E,370560,372800,what men and women search for in each
txCYa0xuL-E,372800,373680,other
txCYa0xuL-E,373680,375280,you know if you're rejected by a woman
txCYa0xuL-E,375280,377360,well why is she rejecting you
txCYa0xuL-E,377360,379520,well maybe her judgment is off and that
txCYa0xuL-E,379520,381520,would be very what would you say
txCYa0xuL-E,381520,383120,convenient for you
txCYa0xuL-E,383120,384880,but she's rejecting you because you are
txCYa0xuL-E,384880,386720,not all that you could be and maybe not
txCYa0xuL-E,386720,389360,even all that you need to be
txCYa0xuL-E,389360,391440,and so that's a very painful rejection
txCYa0xuL-E,391440,393120,and it causes all sorts of tension
txCYa0xuL-E,393120,395039,between men and women but you know women
txCYa0xuL-E,395039,398319,have a lot at stake in this game
txCYa0xuL-E,398319,400720,and so they're looking for something
txCYa0xuL-E,400720,404639,what powerful dominating brutal terrible
txCYa0xuL-E,404639,406400,no
txCYa0xuL-E,406400,408960,something perhaps capable of that
txCYa0xuL-E,408960,410880,but even more important capable of
txCYa0xuL-E,410880,413360,mastering is right and capable of
txCYa0xuL-E,413360,415840,singing despite that
txCYa0xuL-E,415840,417599,we all know that's true and the shame
txCYa0xuL-E,417599,419280,that men feel when they're rejected by
txCYa0xuL-E,419280,422400,women is precisely the shame that they
txCYa0xuL-E,422400,424720,feel at knowing deep in their heart that
txCYa0xuL-E,424720,426560,they have not lived up to what they are
txCYa0xuL-E,426560,428160,capable of being
txCYa0xuL-E,428160,430560,and that harsh judgment that women lay
txCYa0xuL-E,430560,433840,on men which by the way is part of our
txCYa0xuL-E,433840,436160,sexual evolution because we were shaped
txCYa0xuL-E,436160,438479,by sexual selection which by the way is
txCYa0xuL-E,438479,441039,the operation of consciousness on the
txCYa0xuL-E,441039,443440,structures of matter at the most basic
txCYa0xuL-E,443440,445280,possible level
txCYa0xuL-E,445280,447840,well it's a terrible rejection but it's
txCYa0xuL-E,447840,451840,a salutary rejection and that process of
txCYa0xuL-E,451840,454160,differentiated choice has shaped us into
txCYa0xuL-E,454160,455440,what we are
txCYa0xuL-E,455440,458319,that action of consciousness
txCYa0xuL-E,458319,460400,wanting the best from a potential
txCYa0xuL-E,460400,462960,partner and selecting at least in part
txCYa0xuL-E,462960,464479,on that basis
txCYa0xuL-E,464479,466639,and men participate that in that too in
txCYa0xuL-E,466639,469199,the meister singer manner you know men
txCYa0xuL-E,469199,470879,aren't competing
txCYa0xuL-E,470879,472800,for for dominance with each other
txCYa0xuL-E,472800,474560,constantly in
txCYa0xuL-E,474560,476160,in in a
txCYa0xuL-E,476160,478800,what zero zero-sum game to achieve
txCYa0xuL-E,478800,480800,sexual dominance there's an element of
txCYa0xuL-E,480800,482080,that right
txCYa0xuL-E,482080,484000,because some things are a zero-sum game
txCYa0xuL-E,484000,485919,but men are perfectly capable and more
txCYa0xuL-E,485919,488160,than willing in fact to aggregate
txCYa0xuL-E,488160,490160,themselves into skilled groups and to
txCYa0xuL-E,490160,492240,celebrate the elevation of the most
txCYa0xuL-E,492240,495280,skilled above all else
txCYa0xuL-E,495280,497280,and so we see this cooperative venture
txCYa0xuL-E,497280,499360,between men and women over the longest
txCYa0xuL-E,499360,502000,run of possible time in producing some
txCYa0xuL-E,502000,503919,refinement of the human spirit in
txCYa0xuL-E,503919,506639,embodied form and we want that from
txCYa0xuL-E,506639,508080,everyone we
txCYa0xuL-E,508080,510240,require that from everyone we're
txCYa0xuL-E,510240,512880,thrilled to the core of our soul when we
txCYa0xuL-E,512880,514880,encounter it in a conversation or in a
txCYa0xuL-E,514880,516240,course
txCYa0xuL-E,516240,517919,or in a work of art
txCYa0xuL-E,517919,520959,that calls to us in that manner
txCYa0xuL-E,520959,522880,we need to know this increasingly we
txCYa0xuL-E,522880,524880,need to know all this consciously you
txCYa0xuL-E,524880,525680,know
txCYa0xuL-E,525680,527920,we've acted it out we've produced images
txCYa0xuL-E,527920,530720,to represent it it's it tugs at our
txCYa0xuL-E,530720,533279,heartstrings it it manifests itself in
txCYa0xuL-E,533279,535200,our dreams and our work of art our
txCYa0xuL-E,535200,538080,literary works it's all lurking there in
txCYa0xuL-E,538080,540000,some sense and it's not
txCYa0xuL-E,540000,543040,the satanic power of corrupt
txCYa0xuL-E,543040,546000,oppression not fundamentally
txCYa0xuL-E,546000,547839,that's a far weaker forest than that
txCYa0xuL-E,547839,549920,which can overcome it
txCYa0xuL-E,549920,551279,and everything around us would be
txCYa0xuL-E,551279,553519,nothing but hell if that's all there was
txCYa0xuL-E,553519,555680,and everything around us is not only
txCYa0xuL-E,555680,556720,hell
txCYa0xuL-E,556720,558560,you know for fragile and broken
txCYa0xuL-E,558560,561200,creatures ignorant to the core
txCYa0xuL-E,561200,564000,we don't do too badly and people are
txCYa0xuL-E,564000,566399,capable of nobility especially under the
txCYa0xuL-E,566399,568080,duress of suffering that's virtually
txCYa0xuL-E,568080,570050,miraculous when you encounter it
txCYa0xuL-E,570050,573380,[Music]
txCYa0xuL-E,574320,576160,and it's so heartening to see that and
txCYa0xuL-E,576160,577600,you've seen it in the people that you
txCYa0xuL-E,577600,579040,love when they're going through terrible
txCYa0xuL-E,579040,581279,trials you know people become corrupt
txCYa0xuL-E,581279,583600,and embittered by their catastrophes and
txCYa0xuL-E,583600,585120,it's no wonder
txCYa0xuL-E,585120,586240,but
txCYa0xuL-E,586240,588240,certainly in the main that's not the
txCYa0xuL-E,588240,590240,fundamental human response the
txCYa0xuL-E,590240,592720,fundamental human response is keep calm
txCYa0xuL-E,592720,594640,and carry on you know
txCYa0xuL-E,594640,598959,and and good on you for that so
txCYa0xuL-E,599360,602240,well to sum up
txCYa0xuL-E,602240,604720,let's say
txCYa0xuL-E,604720,606880,we solve the power of perception with
txCYa0xuL-E,606880,609839,the divine word
txCYa0xuL-E,610480,612480,that's how it is
txCYa0xuL-E,612480,614560,and what does that mean well it means
txCYa0xuL-E,614560,616160,truth
txCYa0xuL-E,616160,619040,every word a prayer right every word of
txCYa0xuL-E,619040,622079,groping to find a firm foundation to
txCYa0xuL-E,622079,624720,stand on while you make your way through
txCYa0xuL-E,624720,625920,life and
txCYa0xuL-E,625920,627680,every time you hear a conversation of
txCYa0xuL-E,627680,629920,that sort or hear yourself participating
txCYa0xuL-E,629920,632160,in that prayerful process orienting
txCYa0xuL-E,632160,634240,yourself to this highest uniting good
txCYa0xuL-E,634240,636720,and using that to govern your utterance
txCYa0xuL-E,636720,637519,it's
txCYa0xuL-E,637519,640399,it's bomb for the soul
txCYa0xuL-E,640399,642880,yeah it's love that guides that and love
txCYa0xuL-E,642880,644880,is the desire to work for the betterment
txCYa0xuL-E,644880,646399,of all things
txCYa0xuL-E,646399,648640,and that's the proper orienting response
txCYa0xuL-E,648640,650000,we could say
txCYa0xuL-E,650000,653680,and it's truth nested inside of that
txCYa0xuL-E,653680,655360,and that's how it is
txCYa0xuL-E,655360,657440,and that's how it should be and that's
txCYa0xuL-E,657440,661839,how it may forever be
txCYa0xuL-E,662430,667700,[Applause]
