2fY-iSzbls8,4334,6628,"Wow, wow, people."
2fY-iSzbls8,6628,11299,"You know, actually, I love people because my work is about people."
2fY-iSzbls8,11883,14386,It's actually about bringing people together.
2fY-iSzbls8,14886,16053,I'm an artist.
2fY-iSzbls8,16054,17681,"I mean, until I found a real job,"
2fY-iSzbls8,17722,20100,but now it looks like it's getting pretty serious.
2fY-iSzbls8,20141,21518,(Laughter)
2fY-iSzbls8,21518,23645,"But, you know, I also love walls."
2fY-iSzbls8,23645,27023,"And I know that walls are supposed to divide us,"
2fY-iSzbls8,27065,29568,but I think I've found a way
2fY-iSzbls8,29609,31695,to use walls to bring us together.
2fY-iSzbls8,32237,34155,And I've tried this in different places.
2fY-iSzbls8,34197,36740,"This was in Israel, Palestine, 15 years ago,"
2fY-iSzbls8,36783,38159,"where, with my friend Marco,"
2fY-iSzbls8,38159,41121,I took photos of Israeli and Palestinian doing the same job
2fY-iSzbls8,41162,43999,"and then pasted them on Israeli city and Palestinian city,"
2fY-iSzbls8,44040,46501,and people couldn't even recognize who is who.
2fY-iSzbls8,47002,49295,This was in the favelas of Brazil.
2fY-iSzbls8,49838,52257,Faces of women on the hills of the community.
2fY-iSzbls8,52299,54092,(Applause)
2fY-iSzbls8,54134,57304,Often the first target of the violence that is happening there.
2fY-iSzbls8,58263,61308,"This is a local museum we have in Paris, it's called the Louvre."
2fY-iSzbls8,61349,65144,"I don’t know if you’ve heard about it, but I thought I’d give it a shout out."
2fY-iSzbls8,65144,67896,"And with 400 people and paper and glue,"
2fY-iSzbls8,67897,72110,we wheat-pasted the entire plazas to make the pyramid ten times bigger.
2fY-iSzbls8,73028,75905,This was at the border between Mexico and US.
2fY-iSzbls8,77532,78700,Thank you.
2fY-iSzbls8,78742,82036,(Applause and cheers)
2fY-iSzbls8,82037,84539,"Kikito, the little kid, is one year old,"
2fY-iSzbls8,84581,88293,and he lives in the little house you see on the top left of the image.
2fY-iSzbls8,88335,92922,"I just wonder, at his age, what is his perspective on the wall?"
2fY-iSzbls8,93757,98261,"You know, each time I do a project, I wonder: Can art change the world?"
2fY-iSzbls8,99346,101848,And I never really know how a projects starts.
2fY-iSzbls8,102349,104684,"Couple years ago, I was making breakfast"
2fY-iSzbls8,104726,106311,and a friend of mine called me.
2fY-iSzbls8,106311,109897,"Friend Saul, he says, ""JR, you love walls."
2fY-iSzbls8,109898,111733,"Why don't you do a project in prison?"""
2fY-iSzbls8,111775,115445,"I was like, you know, I was just, ""Dude, you know, I would do it,"
2fY-iSzbls8,115487,118657,"but it's too much paperwork administrative, bureaucracy."
2fY-iSzbls8,118698,121909,"Plus, I've been arrested 15 times, they don't want me in there."""
2fY-iSzbls8,121910,123703,"And he was like, ""I know, bro,"
2fY-iSzbls8,123745,126331,"but you love walls so much, what you would do in there."
2fY-iSzbls8,127040,129209,"If you could do it, what could you do?"""
2fY-iSzbls8,129250,131127,"I was like, ""OK, you know what?"""
2fY-iSzbls8,132253,133380,I had an idea.
2fY-iSzbls8,133421,135340,If I wanted to finish my poached eggs
2fY-iSzbls8,135340,139260,"and my, you know, French toast before it gets cold,"
2fY-iSzbls8,139302,140470,I had to get rid of him.
2fY-iSzbls8,140512,143390,"So I told him, ""You know what, I'll paste the entire prison."""
2fY-iSzbls8,143390,145100,"He was like, ""Wow, that's amazing."""
2fY-iSzbls8,145100,146267,"He hung up the phone,"
2fY-iSzbls8,146309,148687,I thought I'd never hear from him for two decades.
2fY-iSzbls8,148728,151272,"He called his friend Scott, who was like, ""What's up?"""
2fY-iSzbls8,151314,154484,"Saul is like, “I spoke to JR, he’s down to do a project in prison.”"
2fY-iSzbls8,154484,157194,"Scott's like, ""That's amazing, let me call the governor."""
2fY-iSzbls8,157195,159072,"Hung up the phone, called the governor."
2fY-iSzbls8,159114,161116,"Governor was like, ""Who's this JR?"""
2fY-iSzbls8,161116,162534,"""He does black and white,"
2fY-iSzbls8,162575,166663,"and, you know, he takes photos of people, he records their story ..."""
2fY-iSzbls8,166705,168456,"""I'm sorry, I've never heard of it."""
2fY-iSzbls8,168498,170250,"""Yes, there's very large murals."""
2fY-iSzbls8,170291,173044,"And the governor was like, ""Wait, wait, wait."
2fY-iSzbls8,173086,177090,"Before I was the governor, I was in a mural."
2fY-iSzbls8,177090,178842,"There were 1,300 people,"
2fY-iSzbls8,178883,181761,"each one of them recorded their story, and I was one of them."
2fY-iSzbls8,181761,183430,"Is that the same artist?"""
2fY-iSzbls8,183471,185597,"The guy said, ""Yes, that's the same artist."""
2fY-iSzbls8,185598,189018,"""Give him full clearance for every prison in the state of California."""
2fY-iSzbls8,189060,190270,(Laughter and applause)
2fY-iSzbls8,190270,191438,Calls me back.
2fY-iSzbls8,191479,193773,"Next thing you know, I’m on Google Earth,"
2fY-iSzbls8,193815,194983,and there's 35 prisons.
2fY-iSzbls8,195024,198611,"I'm looking at them and I'm like, well, first of all, I'm a wallpaper man."
2fY-iSzbls8,198611,201071,I cannot paste if I don't have my clear surface.
2fY-iSzbls8,201072,203867,"So that doesn't work, that doesn't work, that doesn't work."
2fY-iSzbls8,204617,206327,The yard is made of sand and grass.
2fY-iSzbls8,206327,207495,I cannot do it.
2fY-iSzbls8,207537,209164,I know nothing about prisons.
2fY-iSzbls8,209205,212709,"So then I see this one and I'm like, ""Wait, can we zoom in this one?"""
2fY-iSzbls8,212751,214669,"I'm like, ""Oh, actually, you know what?"
2fY-iSzbls8,214711,217213,The yard here in the center looks like it's concrete.
2fY-iSzbls8,217255,218798,"I could work on that."""
2fY-iSzbls8,218840,222385,"""Look, JR, that's a supermax security prison."""
2fY-iSzbls8,222969,224137,"It's called Tehachapi,"
2fY-iSzbls8,224179,226973,it's actually in the top five of the most violent prisons.
2fY-iSzbls8,226973,228433,"I was like, ""That will do it."""
2fY-iSzbls8,228433,229809,"The next day, we flew there."
2fY-iSzbls8,230268,231728,"We arrived there,"
2fY-iSzbls8,231770,234481,"and of course, you know, it's not that easy to get there."
2fY-iSzbls8,234481,236524,"It's like fences, electric fences, walls."
2fY-iSzbls8,236524,239402,And you add more walls and more people that check your IDs.
2fY-iSzbls8,239402,242405,I get all the way to the yard.
2fY-iSzbls8,242447,245992,And it looked like some army guy with bulletproof jackets and heavily armed
2fY-iSzbls8,246034,248453,"who say, ""Alright, this is going to be very simple."
2fY-iSzbls8,248453,250872,There's some people waiting for you in a gymnasium.
2fY-iSzbls8,250872,252123,We gathered some inmates.
2fY-iSzbls8,252123,254375,"You cannot approach them, you cannot touch them."
2fY-iSzbls8,254417,256795,"You can sit at the chair that we designed for you,"
2fY-iSzbls8,256836,259422,"and we're going to surround the area of the gymnasium."""
2fY-iSzbls8,259422,260715,That sounds fun.
2fY-iSzbls8,261174,262467,"I enter the room,"
2fY-iSzbls8,262467,265386,"and we do this thing in France, I don't know if you have that,"
2fY-iSzbls8,265428,267263,"but you shake people's hand, you know?"
2fY-iSzbls8,267305,270725,"So I started shaking people's hands, ""Hello, how are you? My name is JR."
2fY-iSzbls8,270725,271893,"What's your name?"""
2fY-iSzbls8,271935,273895,"And go around the table, and then I sat."
2fY-iSzbls8,273895,276231,And I spoke with them.
2fY-iSzbls8,276606,279442,"A lot of them have been there since they were teenagers,"
2fY-iSzbls8,279484,282195,some of them even from the age of 13.
2fY-iSzbls8,282654,284447,And I've never seen anything like it.
2fY-iSzbls8,284489,287242,And so I told them about my art and about the idea.
2fY-iSzbls8,287283,289285,"And they asked me a question, they said,"
2fY-iSzbls8,289285,291830,"""But what is the purpose of your art?"""
2fY-iSzbls8,292288,294249,"Well, you know, that's a good question."
2fY-iSzbls8,294290,298253,"I don't know if I can answer before, you know, trying a project."
2fY-iSzbls8,298294,302465,"So I explained them an idea, and I said, “Wait, before we start anything,"
2fY-iSzbls8,302507,304175,"I just want you to know,"
2fY-iSzbls8,304175,307929,"if there's anyone here in this room that by being in this project,"
2fY-iSzbls8,307929,310849,"you might offend some of your victims outside,"
2fY-iSzbls8,310849,312016,I'm not your guy.
2fY-iSzbls8,312058,314310,I'm going to get too much attention for you.
2fY-iSzbls8,314727,317772,"If I were you, don't participate in this project."""
2fY-iSzbls8,318231,320942,Six or seven guys stood up and left the room.
2fY-iSzbls8,320942,322110,"I was like, ""Alright."""
2fY-iSzbls8,322151,324696,So we kept on going and I started photographing them.
2fY-iSzbls8,324696,327490,"Very simple, it's just a small part of the process."
2fY-iSzbls8,327532,328992,I'm not really a photographer.
2fY-iSzbls8,329033,332578,"That’s just one part that I use, and I get to meet them and talk with them."
2fY-iSzbls8,332579,334998,"And each of them started explaining me their story,"
2fY-iSzbls8,334998,336124,"where they grew up,"
2fY-iSzbls8,336165,337333,"where they come from,"
2fY-iSzbls8,337333,340628,"how many years, some of them spent decades in this prison."
2fY-iSzbls8,341296,343423,"And the thing is that, I told them, I said,"
2fY-iSzbls8,343464,344883,"""Look, this photo is nothing."
2fY-iSzbls8,344883,347510,I need you to go in the next room.
2fY-iSzbls8,347552,349345,I'm going to leave a mic there.
2fY-iSzbls8,349387,353474,And I want you to record your story from the beginning.
2fY-iSzbls8,353516,354642,"I want to understand,"
2fY-iSzbls8,354684,357729,"you have to talk like, if you're throwing a bottle in the ocean,"
2fY-iSzbls8,357729,359898,I want to understand where you come from.
2fY-iSzbls8,359939,363526,And then what brought you to make that crime that led you to prison.
2fY-iSzbls8,364444,367614,"And if you changed, explain how you changed and why."""
2fY-iSzbls8,367655,369657,"They all went, some stayed for 10 minutes,"
2fY-iSzbls8,369699,371409,"some stayed for 20, 30 minutes."
2fY-iSzbls8,371409,374162,Some of them were crying in that place.
2fY-iSzbls8,374913,377373,Then I went back to my studio and that's what we do.
2fY-iSzbls8,377373,379500,"We print strips of paper like a giant puzzle,"
2fY-iSzbls8,379500,381127,so we have to combine it together.
2fY-iSzbls8,381169,383671,It's all just paper and glue.
2fY-iSzbls8,383713,385965,"And then we combine them by numbers,"
2fY-iSzbls8,386007,387425,and then we went back there.
2fY-iSzbls8,387467,390345,And we started bringing everybody in the yard.
2fY-iSzbls8,390845,392096,And we started pasting.
2fY-iSzbls8,392096,395391,"Everyone from every gang, every race, participated."
2fY-iSzbls8,395433,396893,"Now, the thing is,"
2fY-iSzbls8,396893,399103,we're still in a supermax security prison.
2fY-iSzbls8,399103,400313,"So the guards were like,"
2fY-iSzbls8,400313,403190,"""Look, we love you with your paper and stuff,"
2fY-iSzbls8,403191,405610,"but we’re going to count everything you brought in,"
2fY-iSzbls8,405610,408404,and we’re going to make sure you leave with everything out.
2fY-iSzbls8,408404,410865,So every hour we're going to stop this whole project
2fY-iSzbls8,410865,413076,"and make sure there's not one scissors missing,"
2fY-iSzbls8,413117,416079,"one brush, one, you know, bucket, anything."""
2fY-iSzbls8,416496,417997,"So we went through the process,"
2fY-iSzbls8,417997,421334,and I had planned two to three days to paste the whole thing.
2fY-iSzbls8,421334,423836,"Those guys were so motivated,"
2fY-iSzbls8,423836,426506,that in literally two or three hours we had done it.
2fY-iSzbls8,426506,427924,"So I said, ""Wait, stop, guys,"
2fY-iSzbls8,427966,430927,"they're going to bring you back to your cell, give me a second."
2fY-iSzbls8,430927,433471,"I'm going to try to get some guards to paste with us."""
2fY-iSzbls8,433513,436182,"And they were like, look, ""We love utopianism and stuff,"
2fY-iSzbls8,436224,437642,but that’s where it stops.”
2fY-iSzbls8,437642,439018,"""No, just give me a second."""
2fY-iSzbls8,439018,442563,"So I start going to the guards and I say, ""Hey, do you mind participating?"""
2fY-iSzbls8,442605,444107,"Fifty ""no,"" one guy said ""yes."""
2fY-iSzbls8,444148,445650,"I say, ""Cool, come with me."
2fY-iSzbls8,445692,447151,"They're going to show you."""
2fY-iSzbls8,447193,449362,And then another guard and another guard.
2fY-iSzbls8,449404,451990,"And that's where the real walls were falling down,"
2fY-iSzbls8,452031,455326,because there's no communication between those guards and the inmates.
2fY-iSzbls8,455326,459414,(Applause)
2fY-iSzbls8,459455,460748,And you know what?
2fY-iSzbls8,460790,464168,"From the floor, it was so big we couldn't see it anyway."
2fY-iSzbls8,464168,465586,You had to send a drone.
2fY-iSzbls8,465586,468589,"So remember, again, you're in a supermax security prison."
2fY-iSzbls8,468589,469882,It's geofencing.
2fY-iSzbls8,469924,470925,(Laughter)
2fY-iSzbls8,470925,472134,"So we send in the drone,"
2fY-iSzbls8,472176,474679,"those guys have never seen a drone their whole life,"
2fY-iSzbls8,474679,477639,they were more excited about the drone than the whole project.
2fY-iSzbls8,477682,481227,"And I was so scared because I was like, ""I hope we did the puzzle right."
2fY-iSzbls8,481227,484147,"Because if not, it's going to look a bit ugly from up there."""
2fY-iSzbls8,484147,487400,And that's what you see from up there.
2fY-iSzbls8,487442,494281,(Applause and cheers)
2fY-iSzbls8,496909,498077,Thank you.
2fY-iSzbls8,498119,500121,"The whole yard, all their faces."
2fY-iSzbls8,500163,503458,"And when you zoom in, actually, you see the picnic table,"
2fY-iSzbls8,503499,506961,"you can still see, it looks like a hole, but it's actually an illusion."
2fY-iSzbls8,507003,508880,And you see the guys walking on it.
2fY-iSzbls8,509338,512675,"Now, the craziest part of all of it"
2fY-iSzbls8,512675,515802,"is because of that crazy permit that I had,"
2fY-iSzbls8,515802,518138,I literally walked in without being searched.
2fY-iSzbls8,518138,519849,I had my phone on me.
2fY-iSzbls8,519849,523853,So I started filming in there and posting it on social media.
2fY-iSzbls8,524187,527482,So this guy there was showing me his tattoo on day one.
2fY-iSzbls8,527857,530568,"And then the evening, he called his family and they said,"
2fY-iSzbls8,530568,532153,"""We saw you on JR's Instagram."
2fY-iSzbls8,532195,534530,"It's incredible, we see what you guys are doing."""
2fY-iSzbls8,534572,536365,"He was so proud the next day he said,"
2fY-iSzbls8,536407,538785,"""JR, do you mind me showing my diplomas?"""
2fY-iSzbls8,538785,541871,They started realizing the impact of suddenly having a connection
2fY-iSzbls8,541871,543289,with the outside.
2fY-iSzbls8,543331,544874,Then this guy showed up.
2fY-iSzbls8,544874,546334,His name is Kevin.
2fY-iSzbls8,546751,549753,"You know, when I saw him, I was like, ""Whoa."""
2fY-iSzbls8,549796,555051,"In my life, I'll never have a second chance to ask a guy, hopefully,"
2fY-iSzbls8,555051,557303,why he has a fucking swastika on his face.
2fY-iSzbls8,557345,559347,(Laughter)
2fY-iSzbls8,559388,562642,"And so I ask him, and he was like, ""Oh, this?"""
2fY-iSzbls8,562683,564185,Almost like he forgot about it.
2fY-iSzbls8,564185,567271,"He was like, ""I did this as a gang thing when I went in prison."
2fY-iSzbls8,567271,569232,"But now, if I could, I would remove it."""
2fY-iSzbls8,569273,572235,"I was like, ""OK, do you mind if I take a photo and I share it?"""
2fY-iSzbls8,572276,573444,"He's like, ""Yeah, sure."""
2fY-iSzbls8,573486,574654,I share that photo.
2fY-iSzbls8,574695,576656,"Now, as you can imagine, on social media,"
2fY-iSzbls8,576697,579951,a lot of people were as shocked and offended as I was.
2fY-iSzbls8,579992,582245,"But a lot of people were like, “That’s strange,"
2fY-iSzbls8,582245,584914,because that doesn't connect with the beauty in his eyes
2fY-iSzbls8,584956,586749,"and the humanity in him."""
2fY-iSzbls8,587125,589418,"So I went back to him and I said, ""Look, Kevin,"
2fY-iSzbls8,589418,591337,there's this thing called social media.
2fY-iSzbls8,591337,594298,"I know you've been here too long and you don't know about this,"
2fY-iSzbls8,594340,597301,"but people are writing comments, I'm going to read them to you."
2fY-iSzbls8,597343,599345,And I think some of them you should answer.
2fY-iSzbls8,599387,602098,"So we started talking, and I did many and many videos"
2fY-iSzbls8,602098,604392,"and asking him again and again, and he responded"
2fY-iSzbls8,604433,606686,and he went deeper and deeper.
2fY-iSzbls8,606727,608938,"And it started a chain of people who were like,"
2fY-iSzbls8,608980,611232,"""Let's get this tattoo out of his face."""
2fY-iSzbls8,611274,615360,"So now before we revealed the image that you saw,"
2fY-iSzbls8,615361,617697,I didn't want to throw it to the world like that.
2fY-iSzbls8,617697,619991,"For now, only the inmates and I have seen it."
2fY-iSzbls8,620032,622493,"We started an app where you can actually go in,"
2fY-iSzbls8,622535,623870,"it's totally free,"
2fY-iSzbls8,623870,626956,and you can go and click on any face and hear their story
2fY-iSzbls8,626998,628332,for as much as they want.
2fY-iSzbls8,628749,635006,(Applause)
2fY-iSzbls8,635006,637008,"I wonder, you know, I've seen it."
2fY-iSzbls8,637049,641137,"I saw people telling me that they heard story, and like a podcast."
2fY-iSzbls8,641179,643514,"But I wonder, how would they feel about it?"
2fY-iSzbls8,643514,645600,"You know, I wanted the feedback from them."
2fY-iSzbls8,645641,648060,So I got a permit to go back into prison.
2fY-iSzbls8,648102,651522,"And this time I said, let me work on some more walls, I'll find an idea."
2fY-iSzbls8,652273,655359,"So I go back in there and I started working on the walls,"
2fY-iSzbls8,655401,658613,"but it was really, the excuse was like, I need to speak to you guys."
2fY-iSzbls8,658654,660281,"So I said, ""What happened, guys?"""
2fY-iSzbls8,660281,662909,"They were like, ""Well, what do you mean, what happened?"""
2fY-iSzbls8,662950,665995,"I was like, ""I was on the outside, I couldn't speak to you guys."
2fY-iSzbls8,665995,667413,"What was the impact inside?"""
2fY-iSzbls8,667413,669332,"""Oh, the impact inside is pretty simple."
2fY-iSzbls8,669373,673211,"Let me tell you for myself, I mean, my daughter never visited me in 14 years."
2fY-iSzbls8,673669,677048,"And now she sat in her bedroom, and she listened to my audio,"
2fY-iSzbls8,677089,679008,and now she sees me every week.”
2fY-iSzbls8,679050,681969,"He says, ""You can ask whoever you want of those guys here,"
2fY-iSzbls8,681969,683763,"and they'll tell you the same story."""
2fY-iSzbls8,683804,686557,(Applause)
2fY-iSzbls8,686599,689018,And he told me another thing happened.
2fY-iSzbls8,689060,692188,"""Is that the guards started listening to our stories."
2fY-iSzbls8,692230,693898,"They treat us differently now."""
2fY-iSzbls8,695983,698735,Then we started seeing the walls falling down.
2fY-iSzbls8,698736,700863,So I left a little souvenir in the courtyard.
2fY-iSzbls8,700905,703866,"I was like, ""Let me make one more wall disappear before I go."""
2fY-iSzbls8,703908,708246,So we pasted the mountains from behind the wall on the wall.
2fY-iSzbls8,708287,709830,"And it's still there, actually."
2fY-iSzbls8,709872,715044,(Applause)
2fY-iSzbls8,715086,718464,"This one is still in level four, which is the supermax security prison."
2fY-iSzbls8,718464,721175,And they told me in winter it becomes all snowy.
2fY-iSzbls8,721217,723344,And so you actually don't tell the difference
2fY-iSzbls8,723386,725304,between the reality and the wall.
2fY-iSzbls8,725930,727723,"Now, Kevin was still in prison,"
2fY-iSzbls8,727765,729475,so I visited him again.
2fY-iSzbls8,729976,732728,And something had changed in him.
2fY-iSzbls8,733229,734730,"He was already helping others,"
2fY-iSzbls8,734772,738483,"and, you know, you could tell that he almost had forgotten about his tattoo,"
2fY-iSzbls8,738484,739777,"even if it was still there,"
2fY-iSzbls8,739819,742279,because you cannot remove tattoos in prison.
2fY-iSzbls8,742321,744407,"So I bought him a book,"
2fY-iSzbls8,744407,747159,"and I told him, ""Look, there's a swastika on the cover,"
2fY-iSzbls8,747201,748619,"I thought you would like it."""
2fY-iSzbls8,748619,749787,And he laughed.
2fY-iSzbls8,749787,752039,"But I said, ""No, seriously, this is our friend,"
2fY-iSzbls8,752039,753624,"Art Spiegelman, who wrote it,"
2fY-iSzbls8,753624,756502,"and he told the story about his family in the Holocaust."""
2fY-iSzbls8,757003,759839,And so that night he went and read the book.
2fY-iSzbls8,760881,762383,And he was really moved.
2fY-iSzbls8,762425,763884,"He called his mom and he said,"
2fY-iSzbls8,763884,767930,"""Mom, those French people brought me this book that talks about the Holocaust."""
2fY-iSzbls8,767972,770224,"And she said, ""But you stupid moron."
2fY-iSzbls8,770224,771600,Your family was from Poland.
2fY-iSzbls8,771600,772810,They were hiding Jews.
2fY-iSzbls8,772852,776063,They died in Auschwitz because of protecting them.
2fY-iSzbls8,776105,778441,"And you go in prison and do this on your face?"""
2fY-iSzbls8,778482,779817,He was in shock.
2fY-iSzbls8,781652,785031,"Couple years later, which is a couple months ago,"
2fY-iSzbls8,785031,786198,he came out.
2fY-iSzbls8,786824,789618,"Like many others from the project,"
2fY-iSzbls8,789618,793748,"almost all of them got moved to a lower-security prison,"
2fY-iSzbls8,793748,798336,and one third of them got freed because of having good grades
2fY-iSzbls8,798377,800880,and notes by the guards after the project.
2fY-iSzbls8,800921,804091,"So Kevin went out, and the first thing he did"
2fY-iSzbls8,804091,807511,"was to go up that hill that he looked at for 17 years,"
2fY-iSzbls8,807553,810389,to look down at the prison that he was staying in.
2fY-iSzbls8,810431,813392,"And then the second thing, as I promised him,"
2fY-iSzbls8,813434,816520,I took him to a doctor to remove his tattoo.
2fY-iSzbls8,817146,820858,"And the session started with the laser, and it's very painful."
2fY-iSzbls8,821942,826697,"And at the end of it, the doctor removed the laser and she told him,"
2fY-iSzbls8,826739,829992,"""Well, who's better than a Jewish doctor to remove your swastika?"""
2fY-iSzbls8,829992,836665,(Laughter and applause)
2fY-iSzbls8,836707,837875,And that's him now.
2fY-iSzbls8,837875,844840,(Applause and cheers)
2fY-iSzbls8,844965,848594,"You know, we really tried to bring him here."
2fY-iSzbls8,848844,851305,"But his parole officer, who is actually really nice,"
2fY-iSzbls8,851305,853099,"he said ""JR, you're pushing too much."
2fY-iSzbls8,853099,854517,He's not going to Canada.
2fY-iSzbls8,854558,855726,Sorry about this.”
2fY-iSzbls8,856560,858437,But he knows I'm here talking about it.
2fY-iSzbls8,858437,861065,"You know, I want to use art as a bridge"
2fY-iSzbls8,861065,862983,to make people talk to each other.
2fY-iSzbls8,863317,865277,"I'm not an activist, I'm just an artist."
2fY-iSzbls8,865277,867404,I don't try to tell people what to think.
2fY-iSzbls8,867446,869407,I just try to make them think.
2fY-iSzbls8,869407,871242,"And I really see art,"
2fY-iSzbls8,871283,873619,"to me, it's like, it's in the process."
2fY-iSzbls8,873661,874912,That's what's important.
2fY-iSzbls8,874912,878541,"And after this whole project, after everything I showed you,"
2fY-iSzbls8,878541,881377,"what shook them, what struck them the most,"
2fY-iSzbls8,881377,883129,is that I shook their hand.
2fY-iSzbls8,883170,885381,"So at the end, they even asked me for a hug."
2fY-iSzbls8,887258,890719,"Now I remember their first question, which was:"
2fY-iSzbls8,890719,892596,What is the purpose of your art?
2fY-iSzbls8,893389,897225,"Well, art can change things, but can it change the world?"
2fY-iSzbls8,897268,899061,Or can it change a man?
2fY-iSzbls8,899603,901147,"Before you answer that question,"
2fY-iSzbls8,901188,905109,"think, at some point in your life, have you changed?"
2fY-iSzbls8,905734,908112,"And if yes, if you did,"
2fY-iSzbls8,908154,909572,why can't they?
2fY-iSzbls8,909613,910781,Thank you.
2fY-iSzbls8,913159,920082,(Applause and cheers)
2fY-iSzbls8,926088,928299,"Helen Walters: That's amazing, you're amazing."
2fY-iSzbls8,929467,932178,"You also just got back from Ukraine,"
2fY-iSzbls8,932178,935097,and I wanted to show us just another piece of your work.
2fY-iSzbls8,936640,938392,"JR: Oh yeah, that was in Ukraine."
2fY-iSzbls8,938893,941812,The biggest city in the west side of Ukraine is called Lviv.
2fY-iSzbls8,942229,946233,"And a friend of mine took that photo at the border,"
2fY-iSzbls8,946275,949111,"he sent it to me, I printed it 150 feet long."
2fY-iSzbls8,949111,953032,"We rolled it as a tarp, walked through the border with it."
2fY-iSzbls8,953032,955951,"It's actually easy to go that way, you know, to enter Ukraine."
2fY-iSzbls8,955993,958871,"So they were like, ""Oh, you're going to go this way? Sure."""
2fY-iSzbls8,958913,962750,"And then we drove to, you know, I met some people on Instagram,"
2fY-iSzbls8,962750,964919,and they came and picked me up in their car.
2fY-iSzbls8,965461,968172,And then we gathered hundreds of people.
2fY-iSzbls8,968172,971675,We wanted to show Putin's planes who they were shooting out.
2fY-iSzbls8,972259,974761,(Applause)
2fY-iSzbls8,974762,977264,That little girl is actually safe.
2fY-iSzbls8,977890,980893,"When she got photographed, she was coming out of the country."
2fY-iSzbls8,980893,984355,"So she’s now in Warsaw, and she’s OK."
2fY-iSzbls8,984396,986190,"And since then, actually,"
2fY-iSzbls8,986232,988234,we're moving this image all around Europe.
2fY-iSzbls8,988275,991111,"So while TED was happening in the last four days,"
2fY-iSzbls8,991111,994782,"the image was in Berlin, Dusseldorf, Venice this morning."
2fY-iSzbls8,994823,997660,"And then it will keep traveling and each time, each place,"
2fY-iSzbls8,997660,1000537,people are gathering by themselves and opening it up.
2fY-iSzbls8,1000579,1002414,"HW: That is amazing, JR, thank you."
2fY-iSzbls8,1002414,1003582,JR: Thank you.
2fY-iSzbls8,1003582,1007418,(Applause)
