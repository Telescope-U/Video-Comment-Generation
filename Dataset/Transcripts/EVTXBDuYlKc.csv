EVTXBDuYlKc,1242519,1248289,lot of people never try anything  differently because they have been
EVTXBDuYlKc,1248289,1254649,convinced by people in their lives that  they value that they can't do it they're
EVTXBDuYlKc,1254649,1262929,living within the context of the  opinions that other people have of them  the low expectations many people doubt
EVTXBDuYlKc,1262929,1268269,themselves because when they thought  about doing something at some critical  point in their life somebody they
EVTXBDuYlKc,1268269,1275830,respected and honored somebody they  believed in somebody that they loved  someone they trusted said you can't do
EVTXBDuYlKc,1275830,1284470,that and they accepted that as you look  at your life ask yourself the question
EVTXBDuYlKc,1284470,1291070,what would your life be like what would  your life look like if you decided not
EVTXBDuYlKc,1291070,1296200,to care what people thought of you what

EVTXBDuYlKc,1314410,1320980,your heart you know what courageous  means a Tom Ruskin and Randy Reed said  they said that courage comes from a
EVTXBDuYlKc,1320980,1329320,French word which means of the heart  that how does it feel to you he says
EVTXBDuYlKc,1329320,1334570,such courage you know it takes courage  to live since most people go through
EVTXBDuYlKc,1334570,1341290,life not allowing themselves to step out  because they don't want to let go they
EVTXBDuYlKc,1341290,1347830,don't want to be blown around they don't  want to be moved the courage to face  life's whirling wind of contradictions
EVTXBDuYlKc,1347830,1355260,the courage to love yourself the courage  to love for years I was afraid to love
EVTXBDuYlKc,1355260,1361740,the courage to take a chance the courage  to be who you are
EVTXBDuYlKc,1362820,1370390,he says courage isn't for somebody else  for metals applause our moral depths  courage is what at that moment feels
EVTXBDuYlKc,1370390,1376780,most right for you not just situational  ethics but what feels right in your
EVTXBDuYlKc,1376780,1383740,heart the word at the heart what feels  right in your heart  one great philosopher says cowards die
EVTXBDuYlKc,1383740,1390130,many times before their deaths  the valiant never taste of death but  once what does that mean the value
EVTXBDuYlKc,1390130,1395890,people aren't afraid no no no it means  that they experience that fear and they
EVTXBDuYlKc,1395890,1401260,move forward and move forward any how  many people are dead now many people
EVTXBDuYlKc,1401260,1407140,allowing their dreams to die many people  applying the idea is to lie dormant and
EVTXBDuYlKc,1407140,1413070,collect dust  many people have all this talent and  ability that they are lying to be
EVTXBDuYlKc,1413070,1418780,embedding side of them that they will  take with them to their graves  because they didn't have the courage to
EVTXBDuYlKc,1418780,1426520,be who they are and I say as you begin  to look to all the future and  manifesting your braveness it's going to
EVTXBDuYlKc,1426520,1433180,take everything in you everything in you  that your life deserves to concentrate
EVTXBDuYlKc,1433180,1440120,it f  to begin to look at how is it that I can  express more of me how is it that I can
EVTXBDuYlKc,1440120,1447200,bring my ideas out here now how is it  and start living with a sense of urgency  because you're here today you're gone
EVTXBDuYlKc,1447200,1453470,today life is unpredictable it's  uncertain there's no guarantees no
EVTXBDuYlKc,1453470,1459560,guarantees out here at all so holding  back what are you waiting on ask  yourself what's the benefit of your
EVTXBDuYlKc,1459560,1467720,waiting what's the benefit of your not  living your dream what's the benefit of  not listening to yourself hold please
EVTXBDuYlKc,1467720,1472940,listen to yourself you know the feelings  that you start listening to the feelings
EVTXBDuYlKc,1472940,1482240,in your heart and I'm doing it now more  every day I find that my feelings I can  trust them and I say to you that as you
EVTXBDuYlKc,1482240,1488450,look toward the future you look at life  on a daily basis if there's something
EVTXBDuYlKc,1488450,1495140,that you have been given if you've heard  something within yourself that you know  that that what you do now doesn't fit
EVTXBDuYlKc,1495140,1500960,you it doesn't work for you it's not  giving you what you want and there's  something else that you want to do don't
EVTXBDuYlKc,1500960,1507080,allow that inner doubt in you to talk  you out of it  to build a case on why you can't have it
EVTXBDuYlKc,1507080,1512420,to tell you why you're not good enough  you ignore that inner voice and all of
EVTXBDuYlKc,1512420,1519290,the external voices don't judge the  possibilities for what you can do based  upon the circumstances because the
EVTXBDuYlKc,1519290,1525500,circumstances won't determine who you  are don't determine what you're able to  do based upon your resources go
EVTXBDuYlKc,1525500,1530690,determine what's possible for you based  upon where your life is right now where
EVTXBDuYlKc,1530690,1536000,your life is right now is not you that's  just what it is right now but the
EVTXBDuYlKc,1536000,1541910,possibilities for you are unlimited if  you're in a rebuilding process it's
EVTXBDuYlKc,1541910,1548350,unlimited if you're coming back from  adversity and devastation it's unlimited  of what you can do
EVTXBDuYlKc,1548350,1553910,that's the capacity of human beings it  doesn't matter how many mistakes you've  made doesn't matter how many flops
EVTXBDuYlKc,1553910,1558920,you've had doesn't matter how much money  you've lost in fact I see it only as an
EVTXBDuYlKc,1558920,1565550,investor  what you learn from life not losses but  investments what's possible for you and
EVTXBDuYlKc,1565550,1570890,I say to you that once you start  listening to yourself and as you began
EVTXBDuYlKc,1570890,1576560,to act on your dream as you start just  trying to find your way doing what you
EVTXBDuYlKc,1576560,1582380,can with what you have you will start  seeing things opening up for you start
EVTXBDuYlKc,1582380,1588290,attracting people you say where they  come from things will start coming  together clicking for you you say whoa
EVTXBDuYlKc,1588290,1595940,you start brainstorming ideas will come  out of nowhere as you focus on it the  key to it is to begin to focus on what
EVTXBDuYlKc,1595940,1601910,it is you want to do why why is that  important because as you focus on that  which you want to do that which we focus
EVTXBDuYlKc,1601910,1607640,on that's which we give our energy to it  will begin to multiply it will begin to
EVTXBDuYlKc,1607640,1614090,expand it will begin to develop your  consciousness and out of that comes your  greatness out of that comes a commitment
EVTXBDuYlKc,1614090,1620360,out of that comes a passion for life how  did that comes a special power that you  have in you that you haven't even called
EVTXBDuYlKc,1620360,1626630,on yet see the the powers that we have  will never reveal themselves if we don't
EVTXBDuYlKc,1626630,1634100,challenge them if we don't put ourselves  in the position where we have to use  them so one of the most important things
EVTXBDuYlKc,1634100,1641480,is reading a book that's a really  interesting book called instant  millionaire and the guy said put  yourself in a position where you can't
EVTXBDuYlKc,1641480,1647030,retreat where it's do-or-die sink or  swim

EVTXBDuYlKc,1667370,1673760,tentatively they don't give all their  stuff they don't concentrate they don't  put everything they've got in them one
EVTXBDuYlKc,1673760,1682000,guy wrote a book called all you can do  is all you can  and all you can do is enough but he said
EVTXBDuYlKc,1682000,1688420,make sure you do all you can do and if  we honest this evening we know that we
EVTXBDuYlKc,1688420,1693670,haven't done all we can do so as we look  at the future we can decide that from
