2ERNRMD0bVk,0,2080,welcome to the top four most brutal tech
2ERNRMD0bVk,2080,3679,pranks i've ever shown
2ERNRMD0bVk,3679,5839,number four you can completely stop your
2ERNRMD0bVk,5839,7520,friend's mouse from working by literally
2ERNRMD0bVk,7520,8880,sticking a piece of paper under the
2ERNRMD0bVk,8880,9599,sensor
2ERNRMD0bVk,9599,11599,three on their keyboard use either a
2ERNRMD0bVk,11599,13200,prying tool or just your fingers
2ERNRMD0bVk,13200,15440,to swap out the n and the m keys this is
2ERNRMD0bVk,15440,16800,subtle enough that it'll probably take
2ERNRMD0bVk,16800,18160,them a long time to realize what's
2ERNRMD0bVk,18160,18720,happened
2ERNRMD0bVk,18720,20160,but it's meaningful enough to make their
2ERNRMD0bVk,20160,22160,boss think that they've got a serious
2ERNRMD0bVk,22160,22880,issue
2ERNRMD0bVk,22880,25119,but even better than that go on to their
2ERNRMD0bVk,25119,27119,phone screenshot the home screen and set
2ERNRMD0bVk,27119,28320,it as their wallpaper
2ERNRMD0bVk,28320,29840,once you've moved their icons away
2ERNRMD0bVk,29840,31279,they'll still be able to see them but
2ERNRMD0bVk,31279,33360,they'll have absolutely no idea
2ERNRMD0bVk,33360,35440,why they can't click them but this is
2ERNRMD0bVk,35440,37040,where you start losing friends
2ERNRMD0bVk,37040,38239,you can also do this on someone's
2ERNRMD0bVk,38239,40960,computer but to make it even more evil
2ERNRMD0bVk,40960,43440,you can rotate that image 180 degrees
2ERNRMD0bVk,43440,44559,and then you want to go into their
2ERNRMD0bVk,44559,45680,display settings
2ERNRMD0bVk,45680,48160,and rotate the whole thing 180 degrees
2ERNRMD0bVk,48160,49600,everything will look normal on the face
2ERNRMD0bVk,49600,50000,of it
2ERNRMD0bVk,50000,52239,but none of their apps will open and
2ERNRMD0bVk,52239,53600,their mouse will be moving in the
2ERNRMD0bVk,53600,54719,opposite direction
2ERNRMD0bVk,54719,59840,follow for more chaos like this
