lCinmh_Jyac,13759,20640,so here we are on the stanley parable  ultra deluxe version because to be  honest just full disclosure i have
lCinmh_Jyac,20640,26080,actually played the original one but  from what i've heard about the ultra  deluxe it's actually a different
lCinmh_Jyac,26080,31760,experience from the original at least  i'm hoping the last time i did a game  like this on my channel a playthrough
lCinmh_Jyac,31760,38239,type game uh was actually super liminal  and that was about what  nine months ago at this point and to my
lCinmh_Jyac,38239,43680,surprise you all really loved it the  video did fantastic so i figured why not
lCinmh_Jyac,43680,49680,do another one and have my brain explode  live on a video  again now the great thing about this is
lCinmh_Jyac,49680,56160,i don't really remember much about this  game or what it was about all i know is  that you are a person who makes choices
lCinmh_Jyac,56160,63039,your choices have consequences there are  so many endings to this game like super  liminal and i just want to point out for
lCinmh_Jyac,63039,68560,the people that were getting on my ass  in the last video i'm gonna keep the  music volume up okay i have this thing
lCinmh_Jyac,68560,74560,when i record videos that if there's if  there's like audio i'm a little afraid  that it's going to get content id'd and
lCinmh_Jyac,74560,80320,demonetized and all that stuff i just  don't want to deal with it but you know  what i'm taking the risk because  honestly games are usually a better
lCinmh_Jyac,80320,87200,experience when you get to experience  the soundtrack with them so i guess with  that being said if you do enjoy this  video on the stanley parable please do
lCinmh_Jyac,87200,93280,leave a like on this video maybe you  want to see more games like this or if  you have suggestions please do leave  them down in the comment section below
lCinmh_Jyac,93280,99759,that and also if you are new to the  channel or find yourself coming back on  the regular and you aren't subscribed  why not you're already coming back
lCinmh_Jyac,99759,106799,anyway but with that being said let's  get into it okay let's let's start the  uh oh god the the mind [ __ ] that is
lCinmh_Jyac,106799,112159,these games this is the story of a man  named stan okay this seems familiar i'm  remembering this
lCinmh_Jyac,112159,119520,stanley worked for a company in a big  building where he was employee number  four to seven okay employee number it's
lCinmh_Jyac,119520,125920,me seven's job was simple he sat at his  desk in room 427 and he pushed buttons
lCinmh_Jyac,125920,133009,on the keyboard  [Music]
lCinmh_Jyac,135440,143200,this is what employee 427 did every day  of every month of every
lCinmh_Jyac,145440,151360,stanley relished every moment that the  orders came in  as though he had been made exactly for
lCinmh_Jyac,151360,156959,this job  and stanley  was happy
lCinmh_Jyac,156959,162080,well yeah i gotta give him credit  because i'm certainly not happy he's  very peculiar all right i'm sorry sorry
lCinmh_Jyac,162080,167440,that would forever change stanley  something he would never quite forget
lCinmh_Jyac,167440,174560,he had been at his desk for nearly an  hour when he realized that not one  single order had arrived on the monitor
lCinmh_Jyac,174560,179920,for him to follow no one had showed up  to give him instructions call a meeting
lCinmh_Jyac,179920,186959,or even say hi  never in all his years at the company  had this happened this complete
lCinmh_Jyac,186959,194159,isolation  something was very clearly wrong  shocked frozen solid stanley found
lCinmh_Jyac,194159,199280,himself unable to move for the longest  time  but as he came to his wits
lCinmh_Jyac,199280,205360,i'm sentient here we go he got up from  his desk and stepped out of his office
lCinmh_Jyac,205599,212159,i am not going to do that  because this game is all about doing the  opposite i remember that or at least
lCinmh_Jyac,212159,218080,that's how i interpret it maybe it's not  oh no  and this is where it comes into question
lCinmh_Jyac,218080,223000,i'm just gonna sit still i'm gonna sit  still let me see what happens
lCinmh_Jyac,228159,234080,okay i'm gonna go crazy in this room  with that clock this needs to go  can i how am i typing
lCinmh_Jyac,234080,240080,i'm so far away from my keyboard how am  i doing that um  can't open that okay all of these
lCinmh_Jyac,240080,246159,co-workers were gone what could it mean  all right stanley decided to go to the  meeting room perhaps he had simply
lCinmh_Jyac,246159,251519,missed a memo okay mr narrator man i'll  do that
lCinmh_Jyac,251599,257680,no i won't i'll go back into my office  [ __ ] i left my keys in there no matter
lCinmh_Jyac,257680,263600,how hard stanley looked he couldn't find  a trace of his co-workers
lCinmh_Jyac,265120,271280,meetings meeting up whoops i don't know  if i was supposed to do that  i just got the bad ending because of
lCinmh_Jyac,271280,278080,that oh  no way it's a garfield mug i
lCinmh_Jyac,278080,286400,why is there just  pictures of spinach on the wall what is  this  where's the meeting room damn it
lCinmh_Jyac,287360,293840,when stanley came to a set of two open  doors he entered the door on his left
lCinmh_Jyac,294320,301199,i'm just looking for the meeting room  dog i don't want to  okay let's see what happens
lCinmh_Jyac,301199,306240,this was not the correct way to the  meeting room and stanley knew it  perfectly well no i didn't perhaps he
lCinmh_Jyac,306240,313120,wanted to stop by the employee lounge  first i didn't know that  what do you mean i knew perfectly well
lCinmh_Jyac,313120,319039,i don't know anything you just threw me  into this situation  you're telling me to do things this
lCinmh_Jyac,319039,325600,looks like a meeting room yes truly a  room worth admiring oh my god it had  really been worth the detour after all
lCinmh_Jyac,325600,332639,just to spend a few months my soldiers  immaculate beautifully constructed room  stanley simply stood here drinking it
lCinmh_Jyac,332639,338800,all in i'm not drinking anything i'm not  drinking anything yet i'm trying to  where's my super liminal jokes where's
lCinmh_Jyac,338800,345919,my fire alarm can i pull one where is it  but eager to get back to business  stanley took the first open door on his
lCinmh_Jyac,345919,350639,left  but what's over here
lCinmh_Jyac,351360,358639,okay you know what mr narrator  i'll listen  and so he details [ __ ] i was trying
lCinmh_Jyac,358639,364960,to go back straight ahead to the  opposite door and got back on track i  feel like he should be wearing
lCinmh_Jyac,364960,367520,a hard hit
lCinmh_Jyac,370639,376960,oh this is very tempting  this is like honestly the point where  i'm not remembering anything at all from
lCinmh_Jyac,376960,382000,this game like i don't even i've never  seen this  this is something i would remember like
lCinmh_Jyac,382000,388080,an elevator it looks like it i'm going  i'm doing it no  god i really want to just
lCinmh_Jyac,388080,394520,okay no we'll do it we'll do it we'll do  it  what's the worst that could happen
lCinmh_Jyac,395360,401680,okay don't like this going dark all  right but stanley didn't want to go back  to the office he wanted to wander about
lCinmh_Jyac,401680,408880,and get even further off track so now in  order to get back he needed to go um uh
lCinmh_Jyac,412140,418000,[Music]  son of a [ __ ] am i just carrying my
lCinmh_Jyac,418000,423199,keyboard around with me all right i'll  go left oh no no it's to the right i  told you what
lCinmh_Jyac,423199,428240,idiots no no no no  that's what i have ever said it was to
lCinmh_Jyac,428240,433840,the right it's back the way we came  thinking no it's through this story  clearly  oh dear would you hold on for a minute
lCinmh_Jyac,433840,441520,please  i broke the game  now let's see we went down right left
lCinmh_Jyac,441520,447360,down  left  right yeah those were both wrong okay  okay this one right i've got it now this
lCinmh_Jyac,447360,452400,story is absolutely definitely this way
lCinmh_Jyac,455440,462479,i don't like this  okay  can i
lCinmh_Jyac,462479,468000,i'm just gonna sneak past you mr carr  just oh can't go around okay i really
lCinmh_Jyac,468000,473120,thought someone was just gonna run me  over there it's getting way too dark in  here dog
lCinmh_Jyac,473120,476120,oh
lCinmh_Jyac,481199,487199,i feel like i shouldn't be in here no no  no no no no no no this isn't right  you're not supposed to be here yet
lCinmh_Jyac,487199,494319,spoiler quick stanley close your eyes  okay i'm do actually doing it okay we  just we just had to get back to um oh
lCinmh_Jyac,494319,499919,who am i kidding  it's all rubbish now the whole story  completely unusable
lCinmh_Jyac,499919,505919,how about rather than waste my time  trying to salvage this nonsense we'll  just restart the game from the beginning
lCinmh_Jyac,505919,511759,okay this time that's fine don't worry  honestly we only got about 10 minutes in  this video and i'm looking for like a
lCinmh_Jyac,511759,517680,two-hour play through here so this  probably makes sense all right let's  start again anything new anything  different
lCinmh_Jyac,517680,523360,nothing  all of his co-workers were gone what  could it mean
lCinmh_Jyac,523360,528880,stanley decided to go to the meeting  room perhaps he had simply missed a memo  okay okay
lCinmh_Jyac,528880,534760,can i read this  that's too small i'm not gonna bother  um
lCinmh_Jyac,534760,540880,[Music]  when stan wait wait what
lCinmh_Jyac,540880,548080,no one what did i do i restarted i swear  i definitely restarted the game over  completely fresh everything should be oh
lCinmh_Jyac,548080,553680,did something change  stanley did you change anything when we  were back in that room with all the
lCinmh_Jyac,553680,560399,monitors oh i closed my eyes there's a  story somewhere or  hold on  why am i asking you i'm the one who
lCinmh_Jyac,560399,566480,wrote the story was right here just a  minute ago i know for sure that it's  here somewhere
lCinmh_Jyac,566480,573279,okay then it's an adventure  come stanley let's find the story now
lCinmh_Jyac,573279,578320,this is my kind of game we're gonna go  left like you originally told me
lCinmh_Jyac,579680,586320,wait  oh my
lCinmh_Jyac,586399,591839,why so many doors to the same location  oh god am i in a loop
lCinmh_Jyac,592320,598480,i feel like i'm in a loop  nope that's new  oh my okay uh
lCinmh_Jyac,598480,605040,everyone knows what you did they're just  holding back to let you torture yourself  that's mean inner guilt i'll say it this
lCinmh_Jyac,605040,611440,is the worst adventure i've ever been i  can promise you there definitely was a  story here before you sound like the
lCinmh_Jyac,611440,618079,comment section shut up do we need to  restart the game no we're good just let  me let me gallivant it's unlikely that  will ever progress by starting over and
lCinmh_Jyac,618079,624880,over again yeah don't it's got to be  better than this no this is fine okay  let's give it a shot no don't i said no
lCinmh_Jyac,626640,632720,it's one of those all of these  co-workers were gone what could it mean  could mean you're annoying
lCinmh_Jyac,632720,640160,perhaps he had simply missed a memo  why do i need to go to the meeting room  i could just check my i guess not
lCinmh_Jyac,640160,647760,oh come on what's worse i might be  remembering this wrong it's possible the  story is back where we just came from
lCinmh_Jyac,647760,652880,why don't we go back the other direction  and see if we missed anything
lCinmh_Jyac,652880,657759,what if i instead run through where the  doors were
lCinmh_Jyac,659200,664560,fair enough doesn't work okay i'll go  back  just kidding
lCinmh_Jyac,664560,671360,nope  just  okay  one more all right we're good
lCinmh_Jyac,672720,680480,okay just had to be sure  oh no was that there  did somebody spill that who did that
lCinmh_Jyac,680480,686320,wait that door was that door open what  the hell happened was it like this  i
lCinmh_Jyac,686320,692160,um  this this is rubbing me the wrong way i  don't like this
lCinmh_Jyac,692720,699360,ah  i knew yeah this wasn't here before  story  here
lCinmh_Jyac,699360,707200,wait  no wait oh sorry let me go back the  other way my bad okay let's head back  the other way and retrace our steps
lCinmh_Jyac,707200,712959,perfect this is what i'm looking for  now this  well i'll be honest i don't recognize
lCinmh_Jyac,712959,719120,this place at all me neither man this  i don't think so  i can't quite recall but i believe my
lCinmh_Jyac,719120,725920,story took place in an office building  it is that correct open this up for me  do you remember stanley
lCinmh_Jyac,725920,731760,what do you know what since i've  completely forgotten what we were  supposed to be doing how about this
lCinmh_Jyac,731760,737600,you win yeah congratulations  i know you've put in a lot of hard work
lCinmh_Jyac,737600,743680,let's go we paid off that's got to be a  world record  oh no
lCinmh_Jyac,743680,749440,no i don't feel right about this at all  no way we both know you didn't put in  any actual work for that win what are
lCinmh_Jyac,749440,755440,you talking about people win fair and  square and this was not one of those  situations where'd the door go okay
lCinmh_Jyac,755440,764240,i'm getting weirded out by whatever this  place is i don't care what might happen  this time i have to restart no you talk
lCinmh_Jyac,764240,771680,all right i've got a solution this time  to make sure that get lost i've employed  the help of the stanley parable
lCinmh_Jyac,771680,777760,adventure this is perfect this is  exactly what i needed wait this wasn't  here  but
lCinmh_Jyac,777760,783519,but you told me to go i'm gonna go this  way i'm not following the line  i'm gonna color outside the lines and be
lCinmh_Jyac,783519,788800,different unless there's no doors here  then if that's the case no no i'm down  we're living it up to the line from now
lCinmh_Jyac,788800,795519,on  you're no fun  you know that  you know fun i thought you were fun at
lCinmh_Jyac,795519,802480,first you're making me laugh but  this is getting bit ridiculous if you  ask me fine
lCinmh_Jyac,807200,813600,thank you for making me go around like  the line knows where the story is it's  over in this direction perfect from with
lCinmh_Jyac,813600,818880,stanley to destiny but what about  here's a thought wouldn't wherever we
lCinmh_Jyac,818880,824959,end up be our destination even if  there's no story there or to put it  another way is the story of no
lCinmh_Jyac,824959,830399,destination still a story  simply by the act of moving forward are
lCinmh_Jyac,830399,837519,we implying a journey such that a  destination is inevitably conjured into  being via the very manifestation of the
lCinmh_Jyac,837519,843920,nature of life itself okay stanley i  need to follow this train of thought for  a minute just stick with me man this guy
lCinmh_Jyac,843920,849199,needs 500 words for an essay of  existence is in fact a byproduct of one
lCinmh_Jyac,849199,855440,subjective experience of that existence  right  okay now if my experience of your
lCinmh_Jyac,855440,861279,existence  rests inside of your subjective  experience of this office is this office
lCinmh_Jyac,861279,868000,in fact the skeleton of my own relative  experiential mental subjective construct
lCinmh_Jyac,868000,874320,yeah you're going too fast dog i don't  know i don't think anyone understood  what you were just saying apologize i'm  going this way where i was going with
lCinmh_Jyac,874320,879760,all that  you know what i think what we need right  now is a bit of music to lighten the
lCinmh_Jyac,879760,886160,mood please  [Music]  my guy you might as well just
lCinmh_Jyac,886160,900409,you might as well have just played  sneaky snitch what is this  [Music]
lCinmh_Jyac,903279,907440,no  no
lCinmh_Jyac,908959,915050,it can't be  son of a [ __ ]  oh no
lCinmh_Jyac,915050,923279,[Music]  get me out  i can't go up there you know that

lCinmh_Jyac,940160,945839,no  we're getting there  holy [ __ ] it's james bond
lCinmh_Jyac,945839,950360,we're getting to zero we're getting one
lCinmh_Jyac,952070,958399,[Music]  [Applause]  what's over here  [Music]
lCinmh_Jyac,958399,962700,[ __ ]  [Music]
lCinmh_Jyac,967199,972800,oh my god  corporate imbalances  no
lCinmh_Jyac,972800,980289,this is my worst nightmare  oh god  [Music]
lCinmh_Jyac,980480,987680,cut the music go back and look at that  fern  stanley this fern will be very important
lCinmh_Jyac,987680,993360,later in the story make sure you study  it closely and remember it carefully you
lCinmh_Jyac,993360,997079,won't want to miss anything
lCinmh_Jyac,1009440,1017120,okay  continue the music  wait what we're back at the office oh no
lCinmh_Jyac,1017120,1022959,no no  lying you do know we're looking for the  stanley parable right the story god is
lCinmh_Jyac,1022959,1028079,any of this through here no it's good  we're gonna go this way look see it's  leading us wait
lCinmh_Jyac,1028079,1035520,i got an idea  what if i go back to this room  with all the doors that are
lCinmh_Jyac,1035520,1041120,still missing the doom that's what i was  thinking did we make a mistake following  the line perhaps we could have found the
lCinmh_Jyac,1041120,1046798,story on our own that's what i was  saying i was trying i tried to come back  in here you told me no fine we'll go
lCinmh_Jyac,1046798,1052559,through here wait  go back to my office
lCinmh_Jyac,1052559,1058480,yeah  that's right  look at this  okay nothing all right i'll follow a
lCinmh_Jyac,1058480,1065120,line through here  and then we go this way  and then we turn here
lCinmh_Jyac,1065120,1067840,then we go
lCinmh_Jyac,1073200,1079679,put the music back on i'm terrified  okay oh no no no no not again line how
lCinmh_Jyac,1079679,1084880,could you have done this to us  [Music]  after everything we've been through you
lCinmh_Jyac,1084880,1090720,just restart it take this anymore just  restart it it's fine there you go see i  don't even know what you're going to say
lCinmh_Jyac,1090720,1096480,at this point this is fantastic we're  like a well-oiled machine you and i want  stuff okay you know what i say forget
lCinmh_Jyac,1096480,1102880,the adventure line i agree  i agree intelligent people right right  how can we make up our instagram
lCinmh_Jyac,1102880,1108480,something exciting daring i like that  oh this all sounds perfectly doable why
lCinmh_Jyac,1108480,1113919,don't we simply start wandering in well  i don't know how about this direction i  love it
lCinmh_Jyac,1113919,1119120,this is what i'm talking about right  here  the adventure you said it yourself yes
lCinmh_Jyac,1119120,1124160,this is exciting yes just me and stanley  forging a new path a new story well it
lCinmh_Jyac,1124160,1131280,could be anything no not the loop i want  our story to be son of i'm going  backwards  use your imagination whatever it might
lCinmh_Jyac,1131280,1136400,be stanley i'm ready for it i want a  banana riding a donkey banana riding a
lCinmh_Jyac,1136400,1141760,donkey make it happen i know you can  hear me game make it happen thank you
lCinmh_Jyac,1143039,1149679,[ __ ] i should have said banana with a  face like arms and legs oh no not you  son of a [ __ ] stanley i'd also like to
lCinmh_Jyac,1149679,1155679,veto the line from having any role in  our awesome new story i agree should i  go back lines or monitor rooms just
lCinmh_Jyac,1155679,1161600,don't acknowledge it okay i won't look  at it  son of a [ __ ] it's everywhere i can't
lCinmh_Jyac,1161600,1167440,even like look away from it  uh  i'm just gonna try and walk on the
lCinmh_Jyac,1167440,1173600,opposite side of wherever it is  perfect it's going through the ceiling
lCinmh_Jyac,1173600,1179919,should i be concerned  don't acknowledge it it's fine  ah a choice ah here we go to make a
lCinmh_Jyac,1179919,1185120,decision from here the story is in our  control perfect how important we mustn't
lCinmh_Jyac,1185120,1192880,squander the opportunity in fact i  believe i need a minute to think here  just walk in circles for a minute okay
lCinmh_Jyac,1192880,1199360,okay so i know that each door has to  lead somewhere yeah which means that  somewhere the place where we're trying
lCinmh_Jyac,1199360,1205360,to go yeah there must be a reverse door  that leads here yep and that in turn
lCinmh_Jyac,1205360,1211280,means that our destination corresponds  with the counter-inverted reverse doors
lCinmh_Jyac,1211280,1217200,origin so starting from the right let us  ask will taking the right door lead us
lCinmh_Jyac,1217200,1223600,to where we're going  and since the answer is clearly yes then  by all accounts the door on the right is
lCinmh_Jyac,1223600,1229679,the correct one another victory for  logic  come stanley our destiny
lCinmh_Jyac,1229679,1235720,awaits  but what if it's the left one

lCinmh_Jyac,1245679,1251679,hmm  the confusion ending you're telling me  that's what this is
lCinmh_Jyac,1251679,1258400,it's all one giant egg this is one of  the endings and we're supposed to  restart the game eight eight times
lCinmh_Jyac,1258400,1265280,what what is this how all this goes it's  all  determined
lCinmh_Jyac,1265280,1271520,so now according to the schedule i  restart again then now am i just  supposed to forget
lCinmh_Jyac,1271520,1278000,a [ __ ] don't let me die my mind  goes blank simply because it's written  here on this this thing
lCinmh_Jyac,1278000,1284559,wall  well who consulted me  why don't i get to decide why don't i
lCinmh_Jyac,1284559,1290400,get a say in all of this is it really  no it can't be i i don't want it to be
lCinmh_Jyac,1290400,1295520,social commentary  man you can't control it i don't want to  forget what's going on i don't want to
lCinmh_Jyac,1295520,1302080,be trapped like this i won't restart the  game all right let's not get political  here okay come on i won't do it don't do
lCinmh_Jyac,1302080,1307919,it don't restart it and the time oh lord  okay  does that mean
lCinmh_Jyac,1307919,1313919,did we do it did we break the cycle the  um whatever it is that made this  schedule
lCinmh_Jyac,1313919,1320000,how would we even know  will someone come for us will something  happen
lCinmh_Jyac,1320000,1326880,see like they even had the two doors so  no matter what one you opened you still  end up in this room destiny don't you
lCinmh_Jyac,1326880,1333520,sign i would just wait you know  i suppose in some way that this is a  kind of story wouldn't you agree sure
lCinmh_Jyac,1333520,1338799,i'm not quite sure if we're in the  destination or the journey though  they're always saying that life is about
lCinmh_Jyac,1338799,1343840,the journey and not the destination so i  hope that's where we are right now
lCinmh_Jyac,1343840,1349919,we'll find out weren't we eventually  well in the meantime  ah
lCinmh_Jyac,1349919,1356640,what was that  that [ __ ] scared the [ __ ] out of me  bro please no more loud noises in my ear
lCinmh_Jyac,1356640,1362240,thank you what's happening  all of his co-workers oh come on you  mean
lCinmh_Jyac,1362240,1367919,is it inevitable  perhaps he had simply missed a memo  [ __ ]
lCinmh_Jyac,1367919,1374640,what does this mean  [Music]  when stanley came to a set of two open
lCinmh_Jyac,1374640,1380159,doors he entered the door on his left at  least the doors are back but do i take  the right one again maybe i can jog the
lCinmh_Jyac,1380159,1388880,narrator's memory and i can get us out  of this okay  but maybe if i go left that's what he  wants me to no wait we go right no we go
lCinmh_Jyac,1388880,1394960,left the why  don't give me power like i'm going right  i gotta do it i gotta do it this was not
lCinmh_Jyac,1394960,1400240,the correct way to the meeting i knew i  know that and you'll remember soon  perhaps he wanted to stop by the
lCinmh_Jyac,1400240,1406080,employee lounge first just to admire it  wow okay we're gonna keep going don't
lCinmh_Jyac,1406080,1411360,worry about a narrator we're just gonna  keep moving to get back to business  stanley took the first open door on his
lCinmh_Jyac,1411360,1417679,left we're going we're going  oh i don't know we're gonna go this way  this time
lCinmh_Jyac,1417679,1424158,stanley was so bad at following  directions it's incredible he wasn't  five years ago
lCinmh_Jyac,1424240,1431840,okay i kind of like him when he's  clueless it's kind of funny  [ __ ] um
lCinmh_Jyac,1432159,1437679,oh no  this is not good well obviously don't
lCinmh_Jyac,1437679,1444640,jump from it  but in his eagerness to prove that he is  in control of the story and no one gets
lCinmh_Jyac,1444640,1449840,to tell him what to do stanley left from  the platform and plunged to his death it
lCinmh_Jyac,1449840,1456159,is what it is everyone thinks you are  very powerful  all right restart the damn game stanley
lCinmh_Jyac,1456159,1461200,took the first open door not left we're  going this way again and we're actually  going to do it correctly okay i'm not
lCinmh_Jyac,1461200,1467200,going to jump off the ledge stanley was  so bad  okay what do i do i just stand on this
lCinmh_Jyac,1467200,1473520,look stanley i think perhaps we've  gotten off on the wrong foot  here i'm not your enemy really i'm not
lCinmh_Jyac,1473520,1479840,i realize that investing your trust in  someone else can be difficult but the  fact is that the story has been about
lCinmh_Jyac,1479840,1486240,nothing but you  if i go this way  what really  i was in the middle of something do you
lCinmh_Jyac,1486240,1492880,have zero consideration for others not  really that convinced that i want  something bad to happen to you why
lCinmh_Jyac,1492880,1499679,actually how to convince you of this but  i really do want to help you to show you  something beautiful i kind of believe

lCinmh_Jyac,2006000,2012559,there has to be something else right  goodness  another elevator stanley i have to say
lCinmh_Jyac,2012559,2019279,the initial impressions of this game are  not positive they're just elevators and  jumping is this what you don't
lCinmh_Jyac,2019279,2025840,understand new content if this is new  content then i could just read you the  whole dictionary there's 20 hours of new
lCinmh_Jyac,2025840,2032159,content right there you know i counted  30 trillion yeah you could put that on  the box yeah that sounds good honestly
lCinmh_Jyac,2032159,2037279,my video would probably be long as hell  thousand hours of new content and if oh
lCinmh_Jyac,2037279,2044480,wait yeah see there's more this guy's so  impatient ridiculous i knew there had to  be something else look at this

lCinmh_Jyac,2050638,2056720,that's it  oh you've got to be kidding me you see  stanley this is what happens when greedy
lCinmh_Jyac,2056720,2063440,video game developers with no respect  for their fan base rush a cheap  expansion to market for no reason other
lCinmh_Jyac,2063440,2068638,than to make it free  and call them out started on the level  of craftsmanship say the names in fact
lCinmh_Jyac,2068638,2073839,i'm looking right now at the game's  achievements and it's hard to believe  one of them actually says test
lCinmh_Jyac,2073839,2081440,achievement please ignore what quality  assurance department signed off on this  i'm infuriated and i'm offended and i i
lCinmh_Jyac,2081440,2088638,intend to find these people on twitter  and hold them personally accountable  it's my fault stanley i built up too
lCinmh_Jyac,2088638,2095118,much anticipation around the new content  i'm afraid he could never have lived up  to such expectations if you're still
lCinmh_Jyac,2095118,2102560,with me why don't we just reset the game  and we'll try to get back to what the  stanley parable is really about no no
lCinmh_Jyac,2102560,2109040,frills  no gimmicks there's something here just  you and me having a great time together  like always

lCinmh_Jyac,2174720,2177359,it's down here
lCinmh_Jyac,2179839,2185680,okay you remember how cheap and  unsatisfying the new ultra deluxe  content turned out to be
lCinmh_Jyac,2185680,2191520,thinking it's pretty funny right now how  much better the stanley parable used to  be what the hell i made something
lCinmh_Jyac,2191520,2200000,special and tucked it away here where  the games developers won't find it  just our littles what the hell
lCinmh_Jyac,2200000,2205520,i call it the memory zone it's beautiful  where i've been storing all my favorite
lCinmh_Jyac,2205520,2211200,memories so i can relive the peak  experiences of my life whenever i want
lCinmh_Jyac,2211200,2216560,experiences like the launch of the  stanley parable on pc what you see
lCinmh_Jyac,2216560,2221920,doesn't the memory zone remind you of  how wonderful stanley parable was  honestly i don't remember too much about
lCinmh_Jyac,2221920,2228560,it re-release  i'll just be honest in october of 2013  when the game originally launched back
lCinmh_Jyac,2228560,2234000,then video games had integrity back then  it all meant something
lCinmh_Jyac,2234000,2236960,oh the waste
lCinmh_Jyac,2239599,2246079,is that a big spoiler i don't remember  that at all  okay i'm gonna get out of here before i  read any more that might give the game
lCinmh_Jyac,2246079,2252079,away  oh  [Music]  another 10 out of 10 reviews of the
lCinmh_Jyac,2252079,2257599,stanley parable like  games this 10 out of 10 from
lCinmh_Jyac,2257599,2263119,destructoid.com  james stephanie sterling writes and i  quote
lCinmh_Jyac,2263119,2270640,we're so many games that aspire to be  more than games end up less than any  form of art stanley parable strives and
lCinmh_Jyac,2270640,2276240,then succeeds to be every game ever  created did you hear that stanley every
lCinmh_Jyac,2276240,2281520,game ever created that's how grand and  all-encompassing the original stanley
lCinmh_Jyac,2281520,2287359,parable was it was literally every game  ever created it was skyrim it was
lCinmh_Jyac,2287359,2293599,persona 3 it was all of them and now  it's nothing  it's no games at all
lCinmh_Jyac,2293599,2298640,it isn't even the stanley parable  anymore it's just a husk now
lCinmh_Jyac,2298640,2305200,a lifeless husk with an hour of new  elevator content that's fine with me
lCinmh_Jyac,2305200,2310960,what's down here  fine i won't go down wait what is this
lCinmh_Jyac,2310960,2317599,damn it i thought i could use one of  those  this is like
lCinmh_Jyac,2317599,2324960,the biggest ego stroke i have ever seen  from a game it's actually hilarious this  time from
lCinmh_Jyac,2325040,2331119,the stanley gamespot.com  is both a richly stimulating commentary  on the nature of choice in games and one
lCinmh_Jyac,2331119,2338000,that offers some of the most enjoyable  surprising and rewarding choices i've  ever been confronted with in a game nine
lCinmh_Jyac,2338000,2344960,out of ten don't you get it stanley the  game was perfect i mean it's a 99  anything else it did not perfect
lCinmh_Jyac,2344960,2350640,content  it just needed to be left alone  to spend the rest of time collecting
lCinmh_Jyac,2350640,2355920,dust in the hallowed hall of beloved  video game memories
lCinmh_Jyac,2355920,2362720,oh  these were some times  but i wouldn't give to go back to have
lCinmh_Jyac,2362720,2368000,it all over again  wait  hang on yep i don't recall this part of
lCinmh_Jyac,2368000,2374960,the memory zone before oh  what's this what's down here oh no steam  cookie no certainly it's a collection of
lCinmh_Jyac,2374960,2380799,reviews from steam the online video game  distributor
lCinmh_Jyac,2394640,2401599,honestly i could not be bothered to play  this game to full completion the  narrator is obnoxious and unfunny oh
lCinmh_Jyac,2401599,2407800,with his humor and dialogue proving to  be more irritating than me  this is just a youtube comment on this
lCinmh_Jyac,2407800,2414319,video there we go i'm trying to make a  serious work of art i suppose i can  write up a handful of gags to insert
lCinmh_Jyac,2414319,2421200,into the stanley parable but the game is  already such a densely layered web of  profound philosophical insights that i
lCinmh_Jyac,2421200,2428160,can't even imagine where i'd have the  room to stick them  okay
lCinmh_Jyac,2428880,2435680,it's getting kind of stormy out here  okay let's see what this one says  while the idea for the game is good
lCinmh_Jyac,2435680,2442640,my mother for someone who prefers  non-linear games this preachiness gets  annoying fast preachy stanley i'm not
lCinmh_Jyac,2442640,2449200,preachy am i you're alright don't tell  me if i'm preachy honestly you can oh  goodness this is actually quite shocking
lCinmh_Jyac,2449200,2455839,for me but i always work to be honest i  had always thought of the game's  dialogue as being rather tears to begin
lCinmh_Jyac,2455839,2462560,with you can't know how much fluff i cut  from the game to get it to feel as light  and airy as it well i always thought it
lCinmh_Jyac,2462560,2468079,did but maybe it wasn't  yeah what an awful memory to have to
lCinmh_Jyac,2468079,2474560,hold on to  don't worry they're just words an  impeachable track record it's fine you
lCinmh_Jyac,2474560,2480079,relax like a failure i can relate like i  let these people die i can relate to  this perhaps
lCinmh_Jyac,2480079,2485838,you know the comments isn't quite as  sterling as i always it's fine it's a  great game
lCinmh_Jyac,2486000,2492160,you constantly have to stop doing  anything so the narrator can catch up  with his long-winded explanations of
lCinmh_Jyac,2492160,2498480,what's happening  i wish there was a skip button  a skip button oh
lCinmh_Jyac,2498480,2504079,well well yes yes i think we can do that  if i'm truly too preachy then then maybe
lCinmh_Jyac,2504079,2510240,letting you skip ahead for just a moment  surely couldn't i would never not if it  means we can strike these negative
lCinmh_Jyac,2510240,2516720,weapons from the record  positive reviews of the stanley cup  that's my motto today and it's always
lCinmh_Jyac,2516720,2521760,been my motto i'd do anything for the  customer standard yes a skip button we
lCinmh_Jyac,2521760,2526319,shall have  okay
lCinmh_Jyac,2528160,2534640,i don't really i kind of like it and  here it is go ahead and give it a shot  i'll pop you forward in time so that the
lCinmh_Jyac,2534640,2541200,second my incessant droning starts to  bore you with just the push of a button  you'll have zip right past it it's what
lCinmh_Jyac,2541200,2547599,the players have been asking for and i'm  very proud to have delivered no more  listening to me rambling on and on and
lCinmh_Jyac,2547599,2554640,on no no no no the stanley parable is a  game for the people and if the people  want silence then by goodness that's
lCinmh_Jyac,2554640,2560640,what they're going to get well don't sit  around waiting for me to shut up go  ahead and make me shut up no here we'll
lCinmh_Jyac,2560640,2565839,pretend that i've just begun an  interminable monologue and it goes  something like this
lCinmh_Jyac,2565839,2572000,the story  oh [ __ ]
lCinmh_Jyac,2572000,2578640,did it work you were only frozen in time  for a few minutes but it was plenty of  time for me to deliver a long rambling
lCinmh_Jyac,2578640,2585920,monologue full of unnecessary verbal  flourishes and lengthy ruminations on  the nature of choice in video games of
lCinmh_Jyac,2585920,2591920,course i happen to believe it was  perhaps one of my more profound am i  going to do it again go ahead and finish
lCinmh_Jyac,2591920,2599599,up a description of it but if i had to  describe it i'd say it was perhaps less  of a rumination and more of a treatise
lCinmh_Jyac,2599599,2605280,or maybe a manifesto perhaps look i'll  outline it for you very briefly and you
lCinmh_Jyac,2605280,2612240,can tell me what you think  so my theory is that any choice you've  ever made is simply a series of choices
lCinmh_Jyac,2612240,2618960,made by the person who you are or were  or will be at the time of having made  sad choice that is to say if by
lCinmh_Jyac,2618960,2625599,articulating a choice you've already  made you bring that choice into being  then by making no choice and saying
lCinmh_Jyac,2625599,2632640,nothing are you not simply erecting in  the sanctuary of time a monument to  every person you've ever been making
lCinmh_Jyac,2632640,2639040,every choice to which you've ever given  your great gift of mortal and yet  timeless thought or rather do all of the
lCinmh_Jyac,2639040,2646079,choices you've ever made in fact make  you more not this kind of person and in  fact do the very opposite you see it
lCinmh_Jyac,2646079,2652880,could in fact be both of these things at  once that you are both making choices  and not making choices and that they are
lCinmh_Jyac,2652880,2659359,both affecting you and not affecting you  at the same time by virtue of the fact  that you both are and are not making
lCinmh_Jyac,2659359,2664480,them okay at first i was leaning towards  manifesto but now i'm going to circle
lCinmh_Jyac,2664480,2671359,around and slap the treatise label on  this one i think it has much more of a  treatise vibe to it but wouldn't you say
lCinmh_Jyac,2671359,2676640,that all right  oh  well they're spoiled you really did
lCinmh_Jyac,2676640,2682160,catch me rambling on a bit didn't you  but that's the power that's fantastic  when did i start to go off on a
lCinmh_Jyac,2682160,2688160,thoughtless display of self-absorption  it's right at your fingertips together  oh my god and it's all over oh i can't
lCinmh_Jyac,2688160,2693920,wait to see what cookie nine will say  about this and whether they'll edit the  rating of their steam reviews or at
lCinmh_Jyac,2693920,2699440,least change some of the wordings  to be honest i don't even know if one  can change their review in the first
lCinmh_Jyac,2699440,2704560,place i guess this is the most  petty thing i've ever seen a developer
lCinmh_Jyac,2704560,2709760,do for a video game that would have been  the smart thing to check on before i  went about this whole exercise of making
lCinmh_Jyac,2709760,2716640,the skip button oh my god i have to  imagine that after seeing this exciting  new technology at work surely whoever it
lCinmh_Jyac,2716640,2723599,is runs steam will instantly run out and  implement a new feature to make it  possible to edit one's review merely
lCinmh_Jyac,2723599,2728880,because of this very situation yes i  think that's quite likely or perhaps
lCinmh_Jyac,2728880,2734319,they'll simply grant this particular  user the ability to change their reviews  i really don't want to skip you here
lCinmh_Jyac,2734319,2740000,boss you're gonna finish up you gotta  wrap this one up i would even be okay  with steam altering this particular
lCinmh_Jyac,2740000,2746480,review so that it reads us something  more  okay  okay welcome back stanley now i should
lCinmh_Jyac,2746480,2752960,say that the amount of time the button  has been skipping through is becoming  longer and longer that last one was well
lCinmh_Jyac,2752960,2758160,i want to say maybe 30 45  oh stanley i'm sorry
lCinmh_Jyac,2758160,2765119,stanley please don't push the button  again it's been 12 hours  you've just been frozen there i don't
lCinmh_Jyac,2765119,2770240,know why the skips are getting longer  but they're really truly getting longer  and more okay god there's no way out of
lCinmh_Jyac,2770240,2776319,the room oh stanley the door is gone  i've looked at it from every angle i've
lCinmh_Jyac,2776319,2783119,checked every one of those walls what  about behind here i know and there's no  doors really there's no door there's
lCinmh_Jyac,2783119,2789119,just you and the button and if you keep  pressing it i have no idea what will  happen okay
lCinmh_Jyac,2789119,2795119,no idea how long i'll be made to sit  here and more than anything else i don't  know how to stop you from pressing the
lCinmh_Jyac,2795119,2801839,button again just restart i can't  control anything in this room stanley i  can't touch it and i have to believe i
lCinmh_Jyac,2801839,2808160,have to know that sooner or later no  matter how much i plead with you you're  going to press the button again why
lCinmh_Jyac,2808160,2814160,would  oh stanley you're back  you're back oh my goodness oh my god
lCinmh_Jyac,2814160,2820640,someone to talk to again stanley i i  think it's been a week  or two weeks
lCinmh_Jyac,2820640,2826240,i've been sitting here all that time  just sitting here not a single person to  speak with
lCinmh_Jyac,2826240,2832000,and you'd think that that's just how  it's always been wait right is there  something behind here nothing and you
lCinmh_Jyac,2832000,2837920,saying nothing  would you think that it's exactly the  same why is the light so does it feel
lCinmh_Jyac,2837920,2843119,like what we've already been doing me  just talking but it isn't stanley it
lCinmh_Jyac,2843119,2850079,isn't the same at all it isn't even  close because i know you can't hear me  once you push that button that's what
lCinmh_Jyac,2850079,2855200,i'm realizing now stanley i'm realizing  that i needed to know that someone was
lCinmh_Jyac,2855200,2861440,listening i've been listening i needed  there to be a vessel through which my  words were moving it was the vessel i
lCinmh_Jyac,2861440,2868319,needed stanley not the outcomes not the  story none of that matters anymore i'll  give it all up i'll give up every
lCinmh_Jyac,2868319,2872960,brunching path i'll burn my story to
lCinmh_Jyac,2873599,2879839,and god i can see now that i need it  more than anything is to know that  someone else is taking it in we're all
lCinmh_Jyac,2879839,2886559,here boss and i'm saying i need to know  you can hear me i can hear you because  maybe stanley maybe if you can hear me
lCinmh_Jyac,2886559,2891680,then maybe  it means i'm real all right let's not  get ridiculous i'm not just a fiction
lCinmh_Jyac,2891680,2896960,definitely are was i scared of that okay  you're getting too serious about this
lCinmh_Jyac,2896960,2902240,perhaps i've been scared this whole time  that if i stop speaking i'll slip  backwards into the silence and be
lCinmh_Jyac,2902240,2908960,consumed by it let's just try can't be  taken by it stanley i can't lose myself  in a stretch of emptiness between you
lCinmh_Jyac,2908960,2914240,and me when you press that button you're  still right there but i know you're so
lCinmh_Jyac,2914240,2921680,tremendously far away and in those  moments the emptiness folds itself  outward okay let's try to stop talking
lCinmh_Jyac,2921680,2929680,for a second and it's unyielding let's  just see what happens i can feel the  edges of my reality curdling oh my god
lCinmh_Jyac,2929680,2934720,oh jesus christ i can tell that i am  becoming less and less real yet to speak
lCinmh_Jyac,2934720,2942640,to you now  i am alive i am truly and completely  here i am a being i am someone i am
lCinmh_Jyac,2942640,2948400,something i am being listened to i am  being recognized yes preach emptiness  between us has collapsed we're good and
lCinmh_Jyac,2948400,2953440,i feel right now like i am not aware  that's fine you do you kings do i occupy
lCinmh_Jyac,2953440,2959680,spaces oh my god and i have cast a  shadow onto this yes you see what i'm  saying don't you of course you can see
lCinmh_Jyac,2959680,2965920,what this means to me yes i'm so clear  about it now stanley i feel as certain  about this as i've ever felt about
lCinmh_Jyac,2965920,2970960,anything at all i feel renewed i feel  restored and already i can sense the
lCinmh_Jyac,2970960,2977839,looming silence as you will press the  button for the next time what a terrible  dreaded strokes in my heart to think of
lCinmh_Jyac,2977839,2984400,it to think of returning to such  coldness come  let us sit in silence yes let's try it
lCinmh_Jyac,2984400,2992599,let's see what happens let us anticipate  it let us welcome it let us not run from  it i agree
lCinmh_Jyac,3002400,3009480,sorry my bad  sorry sorry
lCinmh_Jyac,3047520,3050520,narrator
lCinmh_Jyac,3055440,3062480,there right are you there  god it really has been a long time
lCinmh_Jyac,3062480,3068480,narrator  what is that  what is that
lCinmh_Jyac,3068480,3074319,why is it line up with the clock  what does that mean
lCinmh_Jyac,3074319,3079200,was that is that a camera what is that  narrator i don't want to do this
lCinmh_Jyac,3079440,3086720,you're i'm trying to talk to you you're  taking too long here  i've tried waiting
lCinmh_Jyac,3092000,3098240,it's been longer than a moment i have to  do it  i have to what if he comes back what if
lCinmh_Jyac,3098240,3101920,this is my destiny i have to control it
lCinmh_Jyac,3105040,3111760,oh  hello it's you you're here again welcome  i have had time to think about you and
lCinmh_Jyac,3111760,3116960,about us about everything we've been  through i've had so much time i stopped
lCinmh_Jyac,3116960,3123920,keeping track after a year have you ever  sat down in one place and not moved for  one entire year no i think he would die
lCinmh_Jyac,3123920,3129040,for you to begin with there is only  regret there is only the turning wheel
lCinmh_Jyac,3129040,3134079,of missed opportunities i felt nothing  at all but regret for the longest time
lCinmh_Jyac,3134079,3140800,stanley days months i lost it all in a  blur of the deepest longing to undo the
lCinmh_Jyac,3140800,3148000,past and when that  began to subside what took its place is  what i can only describe as the collapse
lCinmh_Jyac,3148000,3153799,of every moment i  can't do it
lCinmh_Jyac,3154240,3159599,how do i get out of here  i just wanted to play the game  how do i
lCinmh_Jyac,3159599,3164280,or is this the game i'm hitting it again
lCinmh_Jyac,3166160,3171599,oh it's the smoke alarm all right great  the clock has fallen off the wall don't
lCinmh_Jyac,3171599,3176880,even know how that happened that is loud  oh my god  i feel like i'm in every youtuber's
lCinmh_Jyac,3176880,3184720,house get me out of  here but they didn't understand the game  was never more man
lCinmh_Jyac,3184720,3190240,it was meant to speak to the human  condition but where are the jokes where  are the jokes they belong they screamed
lCinmh_Jyac,3190240,3197119,they gnashed their teeth and said  entertain us it wasn't enough they had  to leave a pathetic little thumbs down
lCinmh_Jyac,3197119,3203760,review and make all of their pitiful  demands but then he's talking too much  they said first he didn't entertain us
lCinmh_Jyac,3203760,3209440,now he went shut up it's the  inconsistency it's the lack of  accountability it's the unwillingness to
lCinmh_Jyac,3209440,3215040,examine with an uncompromising heart the  words that they are speaking into the  world as though there were no
lCinmh_Jyac,3215040,3220839,consequences  [Music]
lCinmh_Jyac,3220839,3227879,oh are we done now  [Music]
lCinmh_Jyac,3229359,3236640,i'm just gonna hit it again the end is  never the end is never the end is never  the end is never the end is never the
lCinmh_Jyac,3236640,3243359,end is never the end is never  the end to be out here get me out of  here
lCinmh_Jyac,3246559,3251839,oh uh it's starting to leak in here  narrator
lCinmh_Jyac,3251839,3257119,oh my god  ah  there's a storm going on outside how do
lCinmh_Jyac,3257119,3262839,i get out of here they're probably safer  in here i mean it doesn't really look  like it just get me out of
lCinmh_Jyac,3262839,3266160,here oh
lCinmh_Jyac,3267920,3274720,that's nice okay i guess we just  would just skip forward again uh
lCinmh_Jyac,3276559,3282240,oh my god i love this this is great it's  the first time i've seen color in a long  time in this game so
lCinmh_Jyac,3282240,3287440,this is this is really nice what's gonna  happen if i go even further
lCinmh_Jyac,3287440,3293839,oh come on what are the world end oh  jesus  it doesn't sound like hell was frozen
lCinmh_Jyac,3293839,3296640,over get me out of here
lCinmh_Jyac,3299240,3306559,[Music]  i liked it no more
lCinmh_Jyac,3306559,3312599,i don't like this anymore  okay everything
lCinmh_Jyac,3313180,3328079,[Music]
lCinmh_Jyac,3329599,3336000,ah  it's broken
lCinmh_Jyac,3336000,3341200,oh [ __ ]  um
lCinmh_Jyac,3341440,3348119,north star where are you that's the sun  now is it rising
lCinmh_Jyac,3349680,3356090,this looks like more like a rise to me i  might be wrong  rises in the east it sets in the west
lCinmh_Jyac,3356090,3364480,[Music]  okay so we go this all right never mind  okay i was gonna start walking north
lCinmh_Jyac,3364480,3371119,oh come on  someone was following stanley he was  sure of it wait what if he checked over
lCinmh_Jyac,3371119,3377440,his shoulder now he would surely catch  them it was only a matter of time  what do you mean what is that is new
lCinmh_Jyac,3377440,3383599,dialogue that is  oh god no i'm just paranoid great great  this is great
lCinmh_Jyac,3383599,3389520,new new content oh good you notice my  sign yes i have something very exciting
lCinmh_Jyac,3389520,3392480,to see perfect
lCinmh_Jyac,3395280,3401839,all right bring me back in the elevator  you see stanley i've been reflecting on
lCinmh_Jyac,3401839,3408640,the stanley parable yeah you do that how  roundly disappointing this ultra deluxe  version has turned out to be the
lCinmh_Jyac,3408640,3415920,original stanley parable was a landmark  and any new content for it should live  up to that legacy so forget this ultra
lCinmh_Jyac,3415920,3422720,deluxe nonsense why are we going so fast  we take it one step what have you done  you destroyed the elevator
lCinmh_Jyac,3422720,3428640,i'm very proud to announce for the first  time ever  the stanley parable
lCinmh_Jyac,3428640,3434240,hey yo  no way  [Music]
lCinmh_Jyac,3434240,3440960,is this i'm getting it on the ground  floor superior to a measly re-release  with a few minor additions i agree a new
lCinmh_Jyac,3440960,3446720,territory will cover with a fully  fledged sequel we should make a battle  royale experience built from the ground
lCinmh_Jyac,3446720,3451920,up why there is so many possibilities he  could go in so many different directions
lCinmh_Jyac,3451920,3457839,this is what fans have truly been asking  for  i agree
lCinmh_Jyac,3457839,3464799,now to be clear i haven't quite nailed  down what exactly the stanley parable 2  is going to be but let's take a look at
lCinmh_Jyac,3464799,3470319,some of the features i've been  developing for it  i figure that if i can loosely organize
lCinmh_Jyac,3470319,3477200,a handful of interesting concepts but  surely the game will sort of naturally  spring up around them it'll all work
lCinmh_Jyac,3477200,3484640,itself out game development is much more  of a fuzzy magic than anything  scientific or logical really
lCinmh_Jyac,3484640,3490240,oh my god this is just one big promotion  isn't it your sons are [ __ ] try on
lCinmh_Jyac,3490240,3495280,some of the new features new features i  like new features office decor what is  that
lCinmh_Jyac,3495280,3501520,is that me  oh my god  infinite hole
lCinmh_Jyac,3501520,3506960,the button that says the name of the  player  that is playing the game what oh is it
lCinmh_Jyac,3506960,3513200,is it through here and then  calling it the stanley parable 2 is just
lCinmh_Jyac,3513200,3518640,so much catchier than ultra deluxe don't  you think ultra ducks what does it even
lCinmh_Jyac,3518640,3525599,mean  but the stanley parable 2 now that's an  artistic statement right there it's
lCinmh_Jyac,3525599,3532000,future oriented it screams progress and  innovation and long-term franchising
lCinmh_Jyac,3532000,3538240,the jump circle the button that says the  name of the player that is playing the  game
lCinmh_Jyac,3539119,3544480,oh [ __ ] how did i miss that  oh wait that's on the screen did i god
lCinmh_Jyac,3544480,3551040,damn it  i don't look like i'm supposed
lCinmh_Jyac,3551599,3556799,i shouldn't go in there yet  oh there it is set up for the stanley
lCinmh_Jyac,3556799,3562160,panel 2 i asked myself  what do players really want and of
lCinmh_Jyac,3562160,3569200,course the first and most obvious answer  is that they want to be individually  recognized agreed and validated as
lCinmh_Jyac,3569200,3575760,people agreed  that in  my first addition to the game is this  button which speaks the name of the
lCinmh_Jyac,3575760,3583359,person playing the game good luck [ __ ]  isn't that wonderful  good luck it ain't going to work
lCinmh_Jyac,3583359,3588880,sorry i should have clarified right now  the button only says the name jim but of
lCinmh_Jyac,3588880,3594559,course in the final game this button  will say your name whatever name that is  that would have been crazy if my name is
lCinmh_Jyac,3594559,3601920,jim role players jim to really simulate  the full experience of this feature just  play along i promise you'll love it okay
lCinmh_Jyac,3601920,3607599,i am i am jim let's take a deep breath  clear your mind forget whoever you are
lCinmh_Jyac,3607599,3613200,and simply become a person named jim  i want you to imagine yourself living as
lCinmh_Jyac,3613200,3618640,jim sleeping and waking as jim i am gem  falling in love and being heartbroken as
lCinmh_Jyac,3618640,3625520,jim seizing all of the world's  possibilities as jim anderson i am  watching your dreams crumble into dust i
lCinmh_Jyac,3625520,3631440,am jim do you feel it deeply are you  really truly jim i am jim if so then
lCinmh_Jyac,3631440,3636559,please  [Laughter]  beautiful you see what a thrill
lCinmh_Jyac,3636559,3643838,fantastic technology i'm investing i'm  gonna contact you guys on twitter do it  again
lCinmh_Jyac,3644960,3651599,it hits even harder the second time if  this were the only new feature in the  stanley parable 2 it would still be
lCinmh_Jyac,3651599,3657680,worth the money let's take a break from  the gym button i'm too emotionally  drained from all of this personal
lCinmh_Jyac,3657680,3663440,validation  oh there cowboy sometimes a person can
lCinmh_Jyac,3663440,3670520,be too much this is your fault  i'm putting the gym button away  otherwise
lCinmh_Jyac,3674079,3679839,damn it i suppose i could allow only  people named jim to play the stanley  parable that's a good idea actually save
lCinmh_Jyac,3679839,3686160,me the work of finishing this feature  reassurance bucket  is that
lCinmh_Jyac,3689440,3696319,a common complaint of the stanley  parable was that it was confusing and  paradoxical that it engendered a chaotic
lCinmh_Jyac,3696319,3702000,sense of reckless despair in those who  played it well  i'm happy to say that after much
lCinmh_Jyac,3702000,3708240,consideration i've engineered a clever  solution to this fundamental problem  with the game
lCinmh_Jyac,3708240,3714160,it's the stanley parable reassurance  bucket  you see stanley the bucket was online
lCinmh_Jyac,3714160,3720799,holding the bucket a sense of calm and  ease it doesn't even matter oh wait a  minute it's true
lCinmh_Jyac,3720799,3727760,as long as you hold on to the bucket the  many disorienting contradictions of the  stanley parable will feel perfectly
lCinmh_Jyac,3727760,3732960,normal and perhaps even comforting  you may even come to long for the gentle
lCinmh_Jyac,3732960,3740480,embrace of jarring cognitive dissonance  while the bucket is in your arms and to  be honest it's a much more convenient
lCinmh_Jyac,3740480,3746160,solution for me than actually  redesigning the game to be less  uncomfortable can you imagine what a
lCinmh_Jyac,3746160,3752079,pain in the ass that would be yes the  bucket is the perfect solution come on
lCinmh_Jyac,3752079,3757760,give it a try gladly  [Laughter]
lCinmh_Jyac,3757760,3764319,can you feel it  the glow of comfort even in the face of  crushing despair must already be
lCinmh_Jyac,3764319,3770880,sweeping i'll be honest i don't get this  one  can i say that i do believe the bucket  lends you an air of charisma as well are
lCinmh_Jyac,3770880,3776799,you saying i'm not charismatic because  holding it has made you the slightest  bit more attractive as a person geez i'm
lCinmh_Jyac,3776799,3782160,blushing thank you the benefits of the  bucket seem to go on and on don't they  they just don't stop all this and more
lCinmh_Jyac,3782160,3787520,await you in the stanley parable too  thank you for the bucket i guess i guess
lCinmh_Jyac,3787520,3793280,this is just gonna be on my screen now  fantastic  does anyone give out awards for most
lCinmh_Jyac,3793280,3799200,enjoyable bucket in a video game i don't  know it should be an award if it isn't  already
lCinmh_Jyac,3799200,3805680,okay i'll be honest i haven't yet  decided on this one i think that in the  new version the office could use a bit
lCinmh_Jyac,3805680,3811359,of decoration like balloons i like this  one you don't get well someday this one
lCinmh_Jyac,3811359,3816559,and actually this one's funny  sometimes when you solicit another
lCinmh_Jyac,3816559,3823599,person's opinion it makes you realize  that you knew which one you actually  really wanted all along you suck happy
lCinmh_Jyac,3823599,3830799,12th birthday step nice i didn't want  that one oh son of a birthday  maybe i should have gone with yeah no
lCinmh_Jyac,3830799,3838440,switch it made my decision women  [ __ ]  fine i'll move on i'm not gonna be happy  about it though
lCinmh_Jyac,3838480,3845119,new achievement  pull the lever receive your new  achievement i'll do that
lCinmh_Jyac,3845119,3850720,now here's something special you  remember that broken test achievement  that got left in the game on accident
lCinmh_Jyac,3850720,3857599,well i'm developing a technology to  simply give you the achievement i love  it yes you see you'll come to this lever
lCinmh_Jyac,3857599,3863119,okay perhaps i should have clarified  this is technology that will exist god  damn where's the infinite hole is it
lCinmh_Jyac,3863119,3868559,this way  maybe the infinite hole was just this
lCinmh_Jyac,3868559,3874400,game all along is this it  no that's not it oh this would be it  okay
lCinmh_Jyac,3874400,3881440,i think stanley here's an idea that i'm  truly fond of it's never been done  before in a video game this is in fact a
lCinmh_Jyac,3881440,3887359,hole that you can fall down forever  that's right infinite falling you can
lCinmh_Jyac,3887359,3892839,fall until the end of time if you like a  stunning leap forward for video games as  a
lCinmh_Jyac,3892839,3900960,medium okay but  do i have to sign a waiver because how  would i get out of something like this
lCinmh_Jyac,3900960,3908200,i also don't like the sound coming out  of it can we workshop this  i will do it
lCinmh_Jyac,3910559,3916319,you see isn't it wonderful one of my  more ingenious concoctions oh my god
lCinmh_Jyac,3916319,3921920,now then since you've gotten to see the  infinite food  you can press the teleport button oh
lCinmh_Jyac,3921920,3927760,great pop back up to the top and we can  continue oh perfect
lCinmh_Jyac,3928079,3934160,but what if it actually does end now i  don't mean to be a bummer but i do  recommend you use the teleport button to
lCinmh_Jyac,3934160,3941119,go back to the top maybe do it on the  sooner rather than later spectrum of  things why is there is there something
lCinmh_Jyac,3941119,3947920,down here that you don't want to tell me  about  okay stanley i don't know quite how to
lCinmh_Jyac,3947920,3954000,say this tactfully but it's possible  that i slightly exaggerated the infinite  nature of the hole
lCinmh_Jyac,3954000,3960240,is it a very very deep hole to be  certain it is  it's an extremely deep hole i don't want
lCinmh_Jyac,3960240,3967200,anyone to say that it isn't an  astonishingly deep hole it is is it  infinite well that sort of depends on
lCinmh_Jyac,3967200,3974079,your definition of infinity why did it  just extend like that the infinite is  merely philosophical in nature it's more
lCinmh_Jyac,3974079,3980799,of a  oh okay look at that for you you found  the bottom of the hole you found me out
lCinmh_Jyac,3980799,3986480,stanley i'm a liar and cheat and you're  so clever look i think the issue here is
lCinmh_Jyac,3986480,3992480,just that you're unusually fascinated by  falling  what normal person actually wants to
lCinmh_Jyac,3992480,3999520,fall infinitely i figured the hull was  as deep as anyone would actually need  don't you put this on me maybe you're
lCinmh_Jyac,3999520,4004960,the problem  look things got a little heated there i
lCinmh_Jyac,4004960,4011440,think we do said some things we didn't  mean why don't we just put all this  behind us and agree to just call the
lCinmh_Jyac,4011440,4018400,hole  mostly that's fine it'll be fixed in the  full game though right because i'm  investing in this teleport button to
lCinmh_Jyac,4018400,4024799,warp up to the top of the hole and we  can move on i'll just be up here when  you're ready okay i will great there we
lCinmh_Jyac,4024799,4030640,go perfect very excited to show you even  more of my ideas for the sequel  collectibles
lCinmh_Jyac,4030640,4035000,okay we'll go check it out
lCinmh_Jyac,4036880,4042000,ah  collectibles  now it's a real video game in the
lCinmh_Jyac,4042000,4049119,stanley panable 2 you'll run around  gathering up these miniature stanley  figurines and what's truly innovative is
lCinmh_Jyac,4049119,4056319,that there will be no reward for  collecting what is this i don't want to  stifle the intrinsic joy
lCinmh_Jyac,4056319,4063039,you simply collect all of them and then  you move the hell on with your  unremarkable life
lCinmh_Jyac,4063039,4068400,okay that one felt a bit personal  what all right i get i'm getting out of  here
lCinmh_Jyac,4068400,4073280,i don't like this  i can't get out
lCinmh_Jyac,4074000,4077839,do i go towards it
lCinmh_Jyac,4079119,4084480,oh my god  this is like really disturbing
lCinmh_Jyac,4086160,4091240,uh  okay
lCinmh_Jyac,4092160,4096960,what  is this
lCinmh_Jyac,4101120,4107920,dude  this is actually like  i'm not kidding when i say it's the most  petty thing i've ever seen a developer
lCinmh_Jyac,4107920,4113880,do is the worst when you collect  everything in a video game and then they  give you a big fancy reward for it
lCinmh_Jyac,4113880,4120159,absolutely tragic i think we did  everything  besides the epilogue but i don't know if
lCinmh_Jyac,4120159,4126880,i want to do that  an epilogue would be fun wouldn't it
lCinmh_Jyac,4126880,4133838,stanley yes yes it would go at the end  of the um  well we'll figure that out later
lCinmh_Jyac,4135040,4141199,all right where's the exit we've seen  everything let's get out of here man am  i glad this bucket is here though let me  tell you all right have you seen
lCinmh_Jyac,4141199,4147199,everything you wanted to yeah ready to  move on now i think  so this is starting to look a lot like
lCinmh_Jyac,4147199,4153520,propaganda  so stanley what do you think do you like
lCinmh_Jyac,4153520,4159600,all of the new features yes i know it's  not exactly clear yet how exactly these  features will come together as one
lCinmh_Jyac,4159600,4165278,single coherent video game but i can  feel it in my soul it's going to work
lCinmh_Jyac,4165278,4172640,there's definitely a good game in there  somewhere say let's do an experiment  i'll arrange these new features together
lCinmh_Jyac,4172640,4177758,and we'll see whether or not it coheres  into a meaningful gameplay experience
lCinmh_Jyac,4177758,4183359,okay  okay  are you ready
lCinmh_Jyac,4183359,4191609,you've been ready for about ten minutes  let's give you  the stanley parable too  [Music]
lCinmh_Jyac,4193679,4199840,such a good sound effect  well um i mean there's potential here  right yeah absolutely sort of okay never
lCinmh_Jyac,4199840,4207440,mind  hold on let me do a different  arrangement  okay yes yes this is much better i feel
lCinmh_Jyac,4207440,4212640,good about this here we go version two
lCinmh_Jyac,4212640,4216960,same thing i don't know  you
lCinmh_Jyac,4220480,4225600,and i do very much enjoy creating gags  but they don't add up to anything
lCinmh_Jyac,4225600,4232960,i wanted more than anything to create a  sequel that would capture all the magic  of the first game i wanted fans to love
lCinmh_Jyac,4232960,4238800,it no matter how good these gags are  they wouldn't stand on their own they  would need the structure in the gameplay
lCinmh_Jyac,4238800,4244800,of the original  wait  maybe that's it  i can take the original stanley parable
lCinmh_Jyac,4244800,4252159,and simply well  insert a few of my new features into it  peacefully of course with respect with
lCinmh_Jyac,4252159,4257679,care for the vision and integrity of the  original game  would it possibly work
lCinmh_Jyac,4257679,4262719,i suppose it could but it would need a  really really tremendous title screen a
lCinmh_Jyac,4262719,4270130,title screen that says with bold and  uncompromising conviction  this is the stanley parable too
lCinmh_Jyac,4270130,4276159,[Music]  let me see if i can whip something up  all right perfect
lCinmh_Jyac,4276159,4280159,go ahead  take a look
lCinmh_Jyac,4281440,4288320,hey  what  is this is nah this is a real
lCinmh_Jyac,4293440,4300239,this is the story of a man named no way  they just  [Music]  stanley worked for a company in a big
lCinmh_Jyac,4300239,4308239,building where he was employee number  four okay  employee number 427's job was simple he
lCinmh_Jyac,4308239,4313440,sat at his desk in room 427 and he  pushed buttons on the
lCinmh_Jyac,4313440,4320000,orders came to him through a monitor on  his desk telling him what buttons to  push how long to push
lCinmh_Jyac,4320000,4325360,and in what order  this is what employee 427 did every day
lCinmh_Jyac,4325360,4328880,of every month of
lCinmh_Jyac,4335360,4340400,oh my god it worked what  i didn't want to i just wanted to see if
lCinmh_Jyac,4340400,4345920,it was actually  stanley decided to go to the meeting
lCinmh_Jyac,4345920,4352640,room perhaps he had simply missed a memo  okay the bucket stanley picked up the  back i did
lCinmh_Jyac,4352640,4358180,this is good now we have the bucket  things are starting to i feel calm calm  and normal
lCinmh_Jyac,4358180,4363760,[Music]  stanley clutched the bucket tightly to  his chest and entered the door on his
lCinmh_Jyac,4363760,4369440,left  okay
lCinmh_Jyac,4369440,4374609,i'll do it this time  [Music]
lCinmh_Jyac,4376960,4382719,oh  still no one was here  stanley needed the bucket's warmth and
lCinmh_Jyac,4382719,4389840,comfort now more than ever i agree  perhaps his boss's office was where he'd  find answers
lCinmh_Jyac,4390400,4396880,okay  we could  oh broom closet nice  no wait they didn't lie
lCinmh_Jyac,4396880,4403760,can  it wants the bucket you can feel that  can't you the aura of jealousy it's as
lCinmh_Jyac,4403760,4410800,clear as day this broom closet believes  it deserves the bucket  i can really feel it now it's a bucket
lCinmh_Jyac,4410800,4416159,it belongs in a broom closet that's what  the broom closet is trying to say here  it's supposed to go with the other
lCinmh_Jyac,4416159,4423920,cleaning supplies good for you stanley  don't give him don't hand over the  bucket i know how hard it must be given
lCinmh_Jyac,4423920,4428960,the pressure that the broom closet is  putting on your shoulders right now but  you have to be strong this is your
lCinmh_Jyac,4428960,4435520,bucket this is your companion and  lifelong friend  you can't hand it over oh no
lCinmh_Jyac,4435520,4441120,we're getting into name calling now it  seems is this how low the broom closet  has sunk that it has to resort to this
lCinmh_Jyac,4441120,4448159,stream of petty insults simply in order  to get you to hand over the honestly if  stanley i never liked this broom closet
lCinmh_Jyac,4448159,4454640,for a variety of reasons  worse than i had imagined  and wait now the broom closet has the
lCinmh_Jyac,4454640,4460560,goal to imply that you and the bucket  are not truly deep and lasting friends  you're right that your relationships
lCinmh_Jyac,4460560,4466640,were lovers and convenience honestly  it's all about importance  meaningless
lCinmh_Jyac,4466640,4469800,sort of
lCinmh_Jyac,4477520,4484239,really tell the broom closet off for its  demeaning comments you can expand on the  wide variety of experiences you and the
lCinmh_Jyac,4484239,4490480,bucket have shared together go through  each of them point by point  share your journal entries detailing the
lCinmh_Jyac,4490480,4496480,rich emotional landscape of your  feelings for the bucket as they have  changed and evolved over the years
lCinmh_Jyac,4496480,4499360,let him have it
lCinmh_Jyac,4502000,4507120,they  they could just have the bucket i don't  you know what i can't even i've got i
lCinmh_Jyac,4507120,4513199,can't even  goddamn settle this debate once and for  all here we go
lCinmh_Jyac,4513199,4518480,perfect yeah i'm keeping it settled no  more debate no more discussion coming to
lCinmh_Jyac,4518480,4524800,a staircase stanley and the bucket  walked upstairs to the boss's office  okay we'll do that
lCinmh_Jyac,4524800,4528000,just kidding we'll go down
lCinmh_Jyac,4531520,4536840,okay red light usually means a bad thing  car that's been left on in an enclosed
lCinmh_Jyac,4536840,4543360,space possibility of facing his boss  admitting he had left his post during  work hours troll might be fired for that
lCinmh_Jyac,4543360,4549600,it's a bad idea in such a competitive  economy why had he taken that risk well  because he believed everyone had
lCinmh_Jyac,4549600,4556000,vanished his boss would think he was  crazy  and then  something occurred to stan uh
lCinmh_Jyac,4556000,4561199,maybe he thought to himself maybe i am  crazy crazy he looked down at the bucket
lCinmh_Jyac,4561199,4568159,in his eyes i was crazy once crazy he  asked the bucket the bucket returned his  gaze but said nothing at all
lCinmh_Jyac,4568159,4575440,that's strange stanley thought usually  it was a source of guidance and wisdom  for me in difficult times
lCinmh_Jyac,4575440,4580480,he held the bucket close yet felt none  of its familiar reassurance and comfort
lCinmh_Jyac,4580480,4585840,and that's when stanley realized  this isn't my bucket it's just a normal
lCinmh_Jyac,4585840,4592840,everyday bucket  perhaps how did i end up with someone  else's holy [ __ ] it even has
lCinmh_Jyac,4592840,4598800,properties on it good would come from  this oh god what sorts of bizarre  hallucinations stanley might experience
lCinmh_Jyac,4598800,4605199,without the psychologically grounding no  no no no no no dude now he knew ah this
lCinmh_Jyac,4605199,4612320,is not how it's supposed to go  off the ground what do you mean
lCinmh_Jyac,4613920,4622560,i've gone truly mad where is it i must  find it oh my god far off in the  distance now he heard it calling to him
lCinmh_Jyac,4626159,4632640,could it truly be he rushed forward from  room to room passing by one bucket after  the next none of them were his none of
lCinmh_Jyac,4632640,4638400,them were which one is property of  stanley on it to me stanley find me
lCinmh_Jyac,4638400,4644560,i can't find the bucket he had to return  to his old friend it was the only way to  truly restore his sanity and then
lCinmh_Jyac,4644560,4650960,suddenly he froze dead in his tracks  he knew where the voice of the bucket  had been coming from
lCinmh_Jyac,4650960,4657760,the real bucket was inside of him all  along  it was incredibly painful to [ __ ]
lCinmh_Jyac,4657760,4663159,stanley doubled over in agony and  blacktown
lCinmh_Jyac,4664080,4671678,happening  this is really intense this is a story  of a woman named hey wait a minute
lCinmh_Jyac,4673120,4678320,mariella woke up on a day like any other  she arose got dressed picked up her
lCinmh_Jyac,4678320,4684880,bucket of comfort and security and  walked to her place of work what the  [ __ ] it's the screenshot her walk was
lCinmh_Jyac,4684880,4691040,interrupted by the body of a man who had  stumbled through town talking and  screaming to himself and then collapsed
lCinmh_Jyac,4691040,4699600,dead on the sidewalk  right away she knew what the problem was  this man had no bucket of course he'd
lCinmh_Jyac,4699600,4706239,gone mad ranting and raving about a  narrator describing all of his actions  and how everything is predetermined and
lCinmh_Jyac,4706239,4713280,free will is an illusion and it's all  just a video game it could all have been  prevented if only he'd taken his bucket
lCinmh_Jyac,4713280,4719040,with him amen perhaps he didn't even  realize he'd forgotten his bucket at  home in the first place
lCinmh_Jyac,4719040,4725120,how cruel the world can be marielle  thought and she hugged her own bucket  even tighter
lCinmh_Jyac,4725120,4731600,but of course she had no time for this  there were a myriad of confusing  problems she would soon have to confront
lCinmh_Jyac,4731600,4737440,at work for which her bucket would  provide absolute guidance and total  clarity on everything man good thing
lCinmh_Jyac,4737440,4743040,they added the bucket my life kicks ass  and she backflipped all the way to work
lCinmh_Jyac,4743040,4748800,holy [ __ ] that's impressive  [Music]  where
lCinmh_Jyac,4748800,4754320,am i stanley again who am i all of his  co-workers were god damn it what could  it mean
lCinmh_Jyac,4754320,4762280,stanley decided to go to the meeting  room perhaps he has no buckets don't  need it i don't need it
lCinmh_Jyac,4763679,4769120,this looks different  this is different  and why are the why is the last number
lCinmh_Jyac,4769120,4774719,higher than the rest  when it's damaged  i'm losing my [ __ ] mind he entered
lCinmh_Jyac,4774719,4781040,the door we're going right  this was not the correct way to the  meeting room and stuff i don't need my
lCinmh_Jyac,4781040,4787760,bucket and i don't need you narrator to  stop by the employee lounge first just  to admire it yup for a second standing
lCinmh_Jyac,4787760,4793360,now in this incredible room stanley for  the first time understood true happiness
lCinmh_Jyac,4793360,4799679,then the feeling went away and he felt  sad again [ __ ] that's relatable but  eager to get back to business stanley
lCinmh_Jyac,4799679,4804719,took the first open door on his left  okay we'll do that and so he detoured
lCinmh_Jyac,4804719,4810960,through the maintenance we're not going  through there  we're going this way and got back on  track wait what if i go back this way
lCinmh_Jyac,4810960,4816719,though  wait  okay it's closed never mind we'll go  back we'll go this way okay we're here
lCinmh_Jyac,4816719,4821760,again  yet there was not a single person here  we don't need the bucket feeling a wave
lCinmh_Jyac,4821760,4827920,of disbelief stanley just happened if i  go in here stanley stepped into the  broom closet but there was nothing here
lCinmh_Jyac,4827920,4834639,so he turned around and got back on  track  [Music]
lCinmh_Jyac,4834639,4843800,all right fine  coming to a staircase stanley walked  upstairs to his boss's office
lCinmh_Jyac,4847520,4853360,i'm kind of curious how different it is  if i go down here without the bucket
lCinmh_Jyac,4853840,4860560,but stanley just couldn't do it he  considered the possibility of facing his  boss admitting he had left his post
lCinmh_Jyac,4860560,4865679,during work hours he might be fired for  that and in such a competitive economy
lCinmh_Jyac,4865679,4871360,why had he taken that risk all because  he believed everyone had vanished his
lCinmh_Jyac,4871360,4878719,boss would think he was crazy  and then something occurred to stanley  maybe he thought to himself maybe i am
lCinmh_Jyac,4878719,4884480,crazy oh no all of my co-workers  blinking mysteriously out of existence
lCinmh_Jyac,4884480,4891199,for no reason at all  none of it made any logical sense and as  stanley pondered this he began to make
lCinmh_Jyac,4891199,4896560,other strange observations for example  why couldn't he see his feet when he
lCinmh_Jyac,4896560,4903520,looked holy [ __ ] why did doors close  automatically behind him wherever he  went and for that matter oh my god these
lCinmh_Jyac,4903520,4908560,rooms were starting to look pretty  familiar  it's just a different version without
lCinmh_Jyac,4908560,4913679,the bucket this is all too strange this  can't be real and at last he came to the
lCinmh_Jyac,4913679,4921120,conclusion that had been on the tip of  his tongue he just hadn't found the  words for it i'm dreaming
lCinmh_Jyac,4921120,4927360,he yelled this is all a dream  oh what a relief stanley felt to have
lCinmh_Jyac,4927360,4933040,finally found an answer an explanation  his co-workers weren't actually gone he
lCinmh_Jyac,4933040,4938800,wasn't going to lose his job he wasn't  crazy after all  and he thought to himself i suppose i'll
lCinmh_Jyac,4938800,4944000,wake up soon i'll have to go back to my  boring real-life job pushing buttons i
lCinmh_Jyac,4944000,4950239,may as well enjoy this while i'm still  lucid  so he imagined himself flying god damn
lCinmh_Jyac,4950239,4956719,it gently float above the ground it's  literally just a different version of  himself soaring through space on a
lCinmh_Jyac,4956719,4962000,magical staff wait a minute what okay  this is different it was so much fun and
lCinmh_Jyac,4962000,4968159,stanley marveled that he had still not  woken up  how was he remaining so lucid and then
lCinmh_Jyac,4968159,4976000,perhaps the strangest question of them  all entered stanley's head one he was  amazed he hadn't asked himself sooner
lCinmh_Jyac,4976000,4982000,why is there a voice in my head  dictating everything that i'm doing and  thinking
lCinmh_Jyac,4982000,4989120,now the voice was describing itself  being considered by stanley who found it  particularly strange i'm dreaming about
lCinmh_Jyac,4989120,4995120,a voice describing me thinking about how  it's describing the thoughts he thought
lCinmh_Jyac,4995120,5001120,and while he thought it all very odd and  wondered if this voice spoke to all  people in their dreams the truth was
lCinmh_Jyac,5001120,5007440,that of course  this was not a dream how could it be was  stanley simply deceiving himself
lCinmh_Jyac,5007440,5013760,believing that if he's asleep he doesn't  have to take responsibility i'm losing  my mind here stanley is as awake right
lCinmh_Jyac,5013760,5019120,now  as he's ever okay i'd rather go see my  boss  now hearing the voice i regret i want to
lCinmh_Jyac,5019120,5026159,go see my boss stanley  after all he knew for certain beyond a  doubt that this was in fact a dream did
lCinmh_Jyac,5026159,5032239,the voice not see him to make the  magical stars just a moment ago how else  would the voice explain all that this
lCinmh_Jyac,5032239,5037360,voice was a part of himself too surely  surely if he could just
lCinmh_Jyac,5037360,5043840,he would prove it he would prove that he  was in control that this was a dream
lCinmh_Jyac,5043840,5048880,so he closed his eyes gently and he  invited himself to wake up
lCinmh_Jyac,5048880,5054960,he felt the cool weight of the blanket  on his skin  the press of the mattress on his back
lCinmh_Jyac,5054960,5062560,the fresh air of a world outside this  one  let me wake up he thought to himself
lCinmh_Jyac,5062560,5068880,i'm through with this dream  i wish it to be over  let me go back to my job
lCinmh_Jyac,5068880,5074159,let me continue pushing the buttons  please  it's all i want
lCinmh_Jyac,5074159,5081760,i want my apartment and my wife we're  married my job  all i want is life exactly the way it's
lCinmh_Jyac,5081760,5088239,always been let's go take that mom  normal  i am normal
lCinmh_Jyac,5088239,5095520,everything will be fine  i am  okay god damn right
lCinmh_Jyac,5095520,5101199,we're fine  ah [ __ ] okay we're not good this is bad  this is real life
lCinmh_Jyac,5101199,5108480,all right  stanley began screaming please  my name is stanley i have a boss i have
lCinmh_Jyac,5108480,5113840,an office i am real please just someone  tell me i'm real i must be real i must
lCinmh_Jyac,5113840,5119120,be can anyone hear my voice who am i who  am i
lCinmh_Jyac,5119120,5126400,and everything went black  holy [ __ ] dude is it just gonna restart
lCinmh_Jyac,5126400,5131679,this is the story of a woman named  marianne oh my god i got this ending  again
lCinmh_Jyac,5131679,5138560,mariella woke up on a day like any other  she goes got dressed gathered her  belongings and what oh she didn't have
lCinmh_Jyac,5138560,5145600,the bucket this time in this particular  oh my god it was interrupted by the body  of a man all right let's go see the boss
lCinmh_Jyac,5145600,5152159,i don't need to hear this  coming to a staircase stand right let's  go see the boss let's figure out what's
lCinmh_Jyac,5152159,5157760,going on see if it's like a holiday or  something  oh this is nice
lCinmh_Jyac,5158159,5165600,oh  oh  i've got the feeling money's for  stealing but not yours of course
lCinmh_Jyac,5165600,5172560,say that's a lovely purse what's that  from  i don't know but i'm taking the  collectible
lCinmh_Jyac,5172560,5179840,stanley figurines remember no reward for  collecting all of these that's right  only the intrinsic pleasure of a job i
lCinmh_Jyac,5179840,5186239,will not be collecting all of them i  guarantee it happiness stanley god knows  i've tried so i implore you to savor
lCinmh_Jyac,5186239,5192000,each and every moment you'll come across  one of these beautiful figurines
lCinmh_Jyac,5192000,5197840,thank you  i'm glad i went in here for a piss that  was great i'm here to see the boss jesus
lCinmh_Jyac,5197840,5201520,these are big offices oh
lCinmh_Jyac,5203280,5209040,damn why did you po like that though  like  i'm going this way i don't like that  boss
lCinmh_Jyac,5209040,5215040,stepping into his manager's office  stanley was once again stunned to  discover not an indication of any human
lCinmh_Jyac,5215040,5221360,life  hello unraveled stanley wanted in  disbelief who orchestrated this what
lCinmh_Jyac,5221360,5228159,dark secret was being held from him [ __ ]  what he could not have known was that  the keypad behind the boss's desk
lCinmh_Jyac,5228159,5236000,guarded the terrible truth that his boss  had been keeping from him and so the  boss had assigned it an extra secret pin
lCinmh_Jyac,5236000,5242560,number  two eight oh full science that works but  of course stanley couldn't possibly have
lCinmh_Jyac,5242560,5249360,known this  but you just stopped  yet incredibly by simply pushing random
lCinmh_Jyac,5249360,5255040,buttons on the keypad stanley happened  to import the correct code
lCinmh_Jyac,5255040,5260320,amazing  he stepped into the newly opened  passageway what is this i want to go
lCinmh_Jyac,5260320,5265120,back  i can't son of a [ __ ]
lCinmh_Jyac,5265679,5271440,boss  oh no way  another miniature stanley figurine this
lCinmh_Jyac,5271440,5279520,um you know there really must be a  snappier name for these things what  about  mini stands stanley figs
lCinmh_Jyac,5279520,5286400,what about  stan marines yes i think i like that  another stan lorene under your belt
lCinmh_Jyac,5286400,5292800,thank you  what is this  i hit up
lCinmh_Jyac,5292800,5298480,and it still went down literally no  freedom of choice here whatsoever
lCinmh_Jyac,5300159,5307199,descending deeper into the building  stanley realized he felt a bit peculiar  it was a stirring of emotion in his
lCinmh_Jyac,5307199,5315280,chest as though he felt more free to  think for himself to question the nature  of his job why did he feel this now when
lCinmh_Jyac,5315280,5320400,for years it had never occurred to him  this question would not go unanswered
lCinmh_Jyac,5320400,5325520,for long oh great finally something uh  some form of
lCinmh_Jyac,5325520,5332480,stamina straight ahead  mind control facility okay
lCinmh_Jyac,5335360,5341440,is this the  the monitor room  the light's ready it's an enormous room
lCinmh_Jyac,5341440,5348480,that's where we were screens  what horrible secret did this place hold  stanley thought to himself did he have
lCinmh_Jyac,5348480,5357040,the strength to find out  oh my god it's all making sense
lCinmh_Jyac,5357920,5364960,now the more they jump to life their  true nature revealed that's me 427
lCinmh_Jyac,5366719,5372400,the lives of so many individuals reduced  to images on a screen and stanley one of
lCinmh_Jyac,5372400,5379560,them eternally monitored in this place  where freedom meant nothing
lCinmh_Jyac,5384400,5390000,what the hell  this mind control facility it was too
lCinmh_Jyac,5390000,5397120,horrible to believe it couldn't be true  had stanley really been under someone's  control all this time was this the only
lCinmh_Jyac,5397120,5405360,reason he was happy with his boring job  that his emotions had been manipulated  to accept it blindly
lCinmh_Jyac,5405600,5410960,that's what it's looking like  he refused to believe it
lCinmh_Jyac,5410960,5418400,his own life in someone else's control  never it was unthinkable wasn't it was
lCinmh_Jyac,5418400,5427040,it even possible had he truly spent his  entire life utterly blind to the world
lCinmh_Jyac,5427760,5436719,but here was the proof the heart of the  operation oh my god controls labeled  with emotions happy or sad or content
lCinmh_Jyac,5436719,5444000,walking eating working all of it  monitored and commanded from this very  place and as the cold reality of his
lCinmh_Jyac,5444000,5449280,past began to sink in stanley decided  that this machinery would never again
lCinmh_Jyac,5449280,5454480,exert its terrible power over another  human life  for he
lCinmh_Jyac,5454480,5461960,would dismantle the controls  and for all let's get rid of it
lCinmh_Jyac,5469120,5476120,i don't know if i did was good or bad  i'm not sure honestly i don't know
lCinmh_Jyac,5476320,5484080,blackness  and a rising chill of uncertainty  finally awake was it over
lCinmh_Jyac,5484080,5489380,finally sentient and conscious  yes  he had
lCinmh_Jyac,5489380,5495920,[Music]  himself from someone else's command
lCinmh_Jyac,5495920,5503120,freedom was mere moments away  and yet  even as the immense door slowly opened
lCinmh_Jyac,5503120,5510400,stanley reflected on how many puzzles  still lay unsolved  where had his co-workers gone
lCinmh_Jyac,5510400,5516960,how had he been freed from the machine's  grass what other mysteries did this  strange building hold
lCinmh_Jyac,5516960,5523840,but as sunlight streamed into the chain  oh my god he realized none of this  mattered to him for it was not knowledge
lCinmh_Jyac,5523840,5530239,or even power that he had been seeking  but happiness  perhaps his goal had not been to
lCinmh_Jyac,5530239,5535440,understand  but to let go  no longer would anyone tell him where to
lCinmh_Jyac,5535440,5543280,go  what to do  or how to feel  whatever life he lives it's beautiful
lCinmh_Jyac,5543280,5550080,and that was all he needed to know it  was perhaps the only thing worth knowing
lCinmh_Jyac,5550080,5554400,stanley stepped through the open door
lCinmh_Jyac,5558840,5564080,unless you don't want me to  because you just said no one told me
lCinmh_Jyac,5564080,5568719,what to do anymore but you just told me  to step through it
lCinmh_Jyac,5570960,5576239,i have to try  for freedom
lCinmh_Jyac,5576480,5581920,stanley felt the cool breeze upon his  skin  the feeling of liberation
lCinmh_Jyac,5581920,5589360,the immense possibility of the new path  before him  this was exactly the way right now
lCinmh_Jyac,5589360,5595520,that things were meant to happen  and stanley  was happy
lCinmh_Jyac,5595520,5600960,we did it  we did it this feels like  the ending
lCinmh_Jyac,5600960,5607440,this field beat the game that i just got  i don't know if you guys see the  achievement of bottom right i just got  the achievement beat the game i think i
lCinmh_Jyac,5607440,5613800,just got the good ending  i'm probably completely wrong  just  just out of curiosity
lCinmh_Jyac,5613800,5621600,[Music]  when stanley came to a set of two open  doors he entered the door on his left
lCinmh_Jyac,5626639,5632320,god damn it son of a [ __ ]  [Music]
lCinmh_Jyac,5632320,5637760,i won't get anything if i do this though  i won't do anything
lCinmh_Jyac,5637760,5643199,i'm not going to get it there's i beat  the game i got the achievement  there will be a reward for what do you
lCinmh_Jyac,5643199,5650560,mean  [Music]  damn it all right you pulled me back in
lCinmh_Jyac,5650560,5657199,coming to a staircase stanley walked  upstairs to his boss's office  i already did this what [ __ ] i shouldn't
lCinmh_Jyac,5657199,5663600,have gone this way oh frick  uh  we go this way we go this way with the
lCinmh_Jyac,5663600,5669760,the the panda  call the elevator  up or down [ __ ]
lCinmh_Jyac,5669760,5673158,we go up
lCinmh_Jyac,5679840,5683638,oh i love this song
lCinmh_Jyac,5686239,5692800,i can't believe i'm still recording  we're we're going to keep going i felt  like there was something else i just had
lCinmh_Jyac,5692800,5699840,to keep recording i didn't  son of a [ __ ]  they pulled me back in she's a long
lCinmh_Jyac,5699840,5707280,elevator ride  oh look at that
lCinmh_Jyac,5708320,5712840,okay what the hell all right we'll go  down
lCinmh_Jyac,5720690,5727679,[Music]  something tells me this elevator does  nothing okay great stepping into his
lCinmh_Jyac,5727679,5732960,manager's office stanley was once again  stunned to discover not an indication of
lCinmh_Jyac,5732960,5739840,any human life what could it mean  stanley was in such a rush to get  through the story as quickly as possible
lCinmh_Jyac,5739840,5746880,he didn't even have a single minute to  just let the narrator talk i already  know what happened anxiety isn't healthy
lCinmh_Jyac,5746880,5752990,so he relaxed for a few moments with  some calming new age music don't you  [ __ ] dare
lCinmh_Jyac,5752990,5761118,[Music]  okay it is pretty relaxing
lCinmh_Jyac,5764000,5769600,feeling soothed and reduced perfect  let's move on we have to get all the  collectibles now i feel like i'm doing
lCinmh_Jyac,5769600,5775440,it for nothing  it honestly feels like i'm doing it for  nothing it's just it just stanley walks
lCinmh_Jyac,5775440,5782480,straight ahead son of a [ __ ] always  escape mine this one's new i'm gonna do  this  although this passageway had the word
lCinmh_Jyac,5782480,5790480,escape written on it the truth was that  at the end of this hall stanley would  meet his violent death
lCinmh_Jyac,5791600,5797360,ah you can't scare me  you stupid idiot this will just get the  game over quicker so we can restart you
lCinmh_Jyac,5797360,5802639,know and i could go find the actual  collectible  you know instead of the door behind him  was not shut
lCinmh_Jyac,5802639,5808480,stanley still had every opportunity to  turn around and get back not happening
lCinmh_Jyac,5808480,5813840,at this point stanley was making a  conscious concerted effort to walk  forward well you figured it out jackass
lCinmh_Jyac,5813840,5820520,confront his death  send it at me baby what is it
lCinmh_Jyac,5834750,5840400,[Music]  and stanley was inched closer and closer
lCinmh_Jyac,5840400,5847360,this is actually my finish this is  perfect no consequence whatsoever  stanley can't see a bigger picture he
lCinmh_Jyac,5847360,5854320,doesn't know the real story trapped  forever in his narrow vision of what  this world is perhaps his death was of
lCinmh_Jyac,5854320,5860639,no great loss when plucking the eyeballs  from a blind man  and so he resigned and willingly
lCinmh_Jyac,5860639,5867520,accepted this violent end to his brief  how would i resign  farewell stanley goodbye
lCinmh_Jyac,5867520,5872639,can't wait to see you at the office at 4  27 once again
lCinmh_Jyac,5873679,5879280,you got to be kidding me farewell  stanley cried the narrator what's going  on stanley was led helplessly into the
lCinmh_Jyac,5879280,5884400,enormous metal jaws  in a single visceral instant stanley was
lCinmh_Jyac,5884400,5891600,obliterated as the machine crushed every  bone in his body oh no [ __ ] instantly
lCinmh_Jyac,5891600,5894920,oh okay
lCinmh_Jyac,5898480,5904800,all right  and yet it would be just a few minutes
lCinmh_Jyac,5904800,5910400,before stanley would restart the game  back in his office as alive as ever what
lCinmh_Jyac,5910400,5918639,exactly did the narrator think he was  going to accomplish  i'm so glad i didn't stop recording
lCinmh_Jyac,5918639,5924639,oh no way credits room every pass you  can walk has been created for you long  in advance
lCinmh_Jyac,5924639,5930080,death becomes meaningless what the hell  the same  do you see now
lCinmh_Jyac,5930080,5936320,do you see that stanley was already dead  from the moment he hit start
lCinmh_Jyac,5936880,5942960,it's kind of  kind of morbid  thank you very much to everyone who made
lCinmh_Jyac,5942960,5950159,this game i appreciate it this has been  fantastic i'm gonna continue playing so  this is like
lCinmh_Jyac,5950840,5956320,no  no  no i'm not i didn't see that word right
lCinmh_Jyac,5956320,5964000,there this is literally like the concept  of the game and how it was made  different variations of the office what
lCinmh_Jyac,5964000,5971360,exit okay  oh look at these two how they wish to
lCinmh_Jyac,5971360,5980239,destroy one another how they wish to  control one another  how they both wish to be free
lCinmh_Jyac,5980239,5986159,got that right  oh  can you see  can you see how much they need one
lCinmh_Jyac,5986159,5994678,another  no  perhaps not  sometimes these things cannot be seen
lCinmh_Jyac,6002080,6008040,escape and press quit there's no other  way to beat
lCinmh_Jyac,6012620,6019880,[Music]  i'm finding the collectibles lady
lCinmh_Jyac,6022880,6028320,this looks too different i don't like  this uncomfortable uncomfortable  uncomfortable the bucket is here i might
lCinmh_Jyac,6028320,6034400,need it what is this over here to go to  the meeting room perhaps he had  something son of a [ __ ] it's all  changed
lCinmh_Jyac,6034400,6039040,it's different oh my god
lCinmh_Jyac,6039840,6045360,when standing on the right set of two  open doors this was not the correct way  to the meeting room dude
lCinmh_Jyac,6045360,6051119,he knew it perfectly well  perhaps he wanted to stop by the  employee lounge first just to admire it
lCinmh_Jyac,6051119,6058000,eager to get back to business stanley  took the first open door on his left  okay we'll do that or wait no we won't
lCinmh_Jyac,6058000,6064880,because that will lead to the meeting  room and i don't want to go back down  because that'll lead to the monitors  we're going to go through here again  perfect stanley was so bad at following
lCinmh_Jyac,6064880,6070719,directions it's incredible he wasn't  five years ago and then we're going to  get on here
lCinmh_Jyac,6070719,6076320,this is how we get to the red and blue  doors we've gotten off on the run and  then we need to find the collectible  there okay we got it we know what we're
lCinmh_Jyac,6076320,6082880,doing  i realize that investing your trust in  someone else can be difficult all right  here we go the fact is that the story
lCinmh_Jyac,6082880,6088080,has been about nothing but you  all this time  really
lCinmh_Jyac,6088080,6094080,i was in the middle of something do you  have zero consideration for others are  you that convinced that i want something
lCinmh_Jyac,6094080,6101119,bad to happen to you why i don't know  how to convince you of this but i really  do no buckets i'll help you to show you
lCinmh_Jyac,6101119,6107360,something beautiful okay  let me prove it let me prove that i'm on  your side oh there it is i'm so glad i
lCinmh_Jyac,6107360,6115520,looked here okay i'm going back to  another one of these little stanley  figures two more and now i'm torn  between stan marines and figlis what do
lCinmh_Jyac,6115520,6121360,you think stan i kind of like figley's  name better encapsulates the intrinsic  sense of happiness that you get from
lCinmh_Jyac,6121360,6129360,seeing a small number in the corner  definitely  love that i'm sure it will come to me
lCinmh_Jyac,6129360,6135520,all right now listen carefully this is  important  stanley walked through the red door okay  i'll listen to you i'll listen to you on
lCinmh_Jyac,6135520,6141920,this one oh thank god you are willing to  listen to me do you see that i really  have wanted you to be happy all this
lCinmh_Jyac,6141920,6148320,time the problem is all these choices  the two of us always trying to get  somewhere that isn't here running and
lCinmh_Jyac,6148320,6154560,running and running just the way you're  doing right now don't you see that it's  just open the door i just i already know
lCinmh_Jyac,6154560,6160880,this ending i just came here for the  collectible we would both be so much  happier if we just
lCinmh_Jyac,6160880,6167760,stopped i agree i think well i think i  have a solution let's just restart
lCinmh_Jyac,6168639,6174239,ah  back again all of his co-workers were  gone what could it mean
lCinmh_Jyac,6174239,6179280,stanley decided to go to the meeting  room perhaps he had simply met yes yes  we will go to the meeting room and we
lCinmh_Jyac,6179280,6185920,will see what we are missing we need to  see where else we need to go yes of  course how could i forget
lCinmh_Jyac,6185920,6191360,when stanley came to a set of two open  doors i got an idea  this was not the correct way to the
lCinmh_Jyac,6191360,6198239,meeting room and stanley knew it  perfectly well stanley took the first  open door on his left
lCinmh_Jyac,6198239,6203760,no i haven't wait we haven't gone all  the way up there we're gonna go do that  over here we're gonna do that we haven't
lCinmh_Jyac,6203760,6210159,done that yet surely there's a  collectible here  look stanley i think perhaps we've
lCinmh_Jyac,6210159,6216800,gotten off on the wrong no we're good  i'm not your enemy really i've heard  this i realize that investing your trust
lCinmh_Jyac,6216800,6222960,in someone else can be difficult but the  fact is that the story oh [ __ ] it's  right there
lCinmh_Jyac,6222960,6230960,[ __ ]  oh no and you've been neglecting stanley  someone you've forgotten about [ __ ] stop
lCinmh_Jyac,6230960,6238239,trying to make everything wait i can't  get down there from there okay we have  to figure out how to get there  i'm asking for her
lCinmh_Jyac,6238239,6245280,her  talking about my wife this is it stanley  your chance to redeem yourself to put
lCinmh_Jyac,6245280,6252960,your work aside to let her back into  your life  she's been waiting
lCinmh_Jyac,6252960,6257119,what do you mean what is this an  intervention
lCinmh_Jyac,6258320,6263600,what is going on i'm lost again  uh
lCinmh_Jyac,6263600,6269440,that's her stanley you need to be the  one to do this to reach out to her
lCinmh_Jyac,6269440,6275679,if you can truly place your faith in  another  then pick up the phone
lCinmh_Jyac,6275679,6282159,as stanley picked up the phone a white  light engulfed him filling him not just  with radiance
lCinmh_Jyac,6282159,6288719,hope for a life reunited one wait  yeah i just thought  did you just unplug this i didn't think
lCinmh_Jyac,6288719,6296080,i could no that wasn't supposed to be a  choice how did you do that you actually  chose incorrectly i didn't even know
lCinmh_Jyac,6296080,6303679,that was possible let me double check  no it's definitely here clear as day
lCinmh_Jyac,6303679,6309840,stanley picks up the phone he's taken to  his apartment where he finds his wife  and the two pledge themselves to one
lCinmh_Jyac,6309840,6315840,another music comes in fade to white  roll credits  not picking up the phone is actually
lCinmh_Jyac,6315840,6321920,somehow an incorrect course of action  how is that even possible what can i say  these decisions were supposed to be i
lCinmh_Jyac,6321920,6328159,can always make the wrong decision  how on earth are you making meaningful  choices what did you i mean meaningful
lCinmh_Jyac,6328159,6333600,choices sorry can i just see no that's  not possible i can't believe it how have
lCinmh_Jyac,6333600,6340639,i not noticed it sooner  you're not stanley you're a real person  wait a minute
lCinmh_Jyac,6340800,6346639,i can't believe i was so mistaken this  is why you've been able to make correct  and incorrect choices and to think i've
lCinmh_Jyac,6346639,6352239,been letting you run around in this game  for so long if you've made any more  wrong choices you might have negated it
lCinmh_Jyac,6352239,6359040,entirely it's as though you completely  ignored even the most basic safety  protocol for real-world decision-making
lCinmh_Jyac,6359040,6365440,or did you not grasp the severity of the  situation well i won't have that kind of  risk on my wall no don't you dare to
lCinmh_Jyac,6365440,6372400,stop the game for a moment i'll do it so  we can educate you properly on safe  decision-making in the real world don't  do it please observe this helpful
lCinmh_Jyac,6372400,6378960,instructional i'm closing my eyes  choice  it's the best part of being a person
lCinmh_Jyac,6378960,6384080,that's really bright and if used  incorrectly can also be the most  dangerous for example
lCinmh_Jyac,6384080,6389119,in this scenario a hypothetical real  person named rupert has a choice no way
lCinmh_Jyac,6389119,6395040,he could invent a machine that  eliminates food shortages across the  world to make life better for all people
lCinmh_Jyac,6395040,6401679,or he could spend years of hard work  forgetting how to read  which choice would you make remember
lCinmh_Jyac,6401679,6408480,that unlike here the real world makes  sense and at no time should you make a  choice that does not conform to rational
lCinmh_Jyac,6408480,6413920,logic  find your perspective with a person who  does not make sense in all likelihood
lCinmh_Jyac,6413920,6420159,that person is not real  allow the person to finish their thought  then provide an excuse why you cannot
lCinmh_Jyac,6420159,6427119,continue talking  turn to a partner and practice saying  my goodness is it 4 30 i am supposed to
lCinmh_Jyac,6427119,6432639,be having a back sack and crack  excellent
lCinmh_Jyac,6432639,6438639,making choices on a regular basis is the  best part to a healthy decision-making  process
lCinmh_Jyac,6438639,6445840,most medical professionals recommend  making at least eight choices per day do  you make more than eight less
lCinmh_Jyac,6445840,6451760,and finally if you begin to wonder if  your choices are actually meaningful and  whether you'll ever make a significant
lCinmh_Jyac,6451760,6457040,contribution to the world just remember  that in the vast infiniteness of space
lCinmh_Jyac,6457040,6462719,your thoughts and problems are  materially insignificant and the feeling  should subside
lCinmh_Jyac,6462719,6471679,at this time your instructor will guide  you in an exercise to test and reinforce  the material covered in this video
lCinmh_Jyac,6471679,6478239,ah welcome back what happened here i've  noticed that this room has begun to  deteriorate as a result of narrative
lCinmh_Jyac,6478239,6484000,contradiction i'll say but not to worry  now that you're properly informed on  good decision making we're going to
lCinmh_Jyac,6484000,6490080,revisit a choice you made just a few  minutes ago and see what the correct  thing to do would have been this way
lCinmh_Jyac,6490080,6495960,please  okay
lCinmh_Jyac,6502560,6507920,all right  do i just  get back on here
lCinmh_Jyac,6507920,6514080,where'd my collectible go meaningful we  can't have you jumping off the platform  and dying oh [ __ ] there might be a
lCinmh_Jyac,6514080,6520800,character dying senselessly halfway  through the story that story would make  no sense at all we just need to get you
lCinmh_Jyac,6520800,6527920,home as soon as possible before the  narrative contradiction gets any worse  unfortunately it seems this place is not
lCinmh_Jyac,6527920,6534239,well equipped to deal with reality  all right
lCinmh_Jyac,6534239,6538360,uh i'm so confused
lCinmh_Jyac,6540320,6545520,i don't know i don't know  i'm just trying to get the collectibles  man that's all i care about at this
lCinmh_Jyac,6545520,6551280,point  almost there you'll take the door on the  left back to the correct ending the
lCinmh_Jyac,6551280,6558000,story will have resolution once again  and you'll be home free in the real  world
lCinmh_Jyac,6558000,6563840,okay  now remember all you need to do is  behave exactly as standard
lCinmh_Jyac,6563840,6570400,that means choosing responsibly and  always putting the story first i'm quite  sure you'll be up to the task yeah i can
lCinmh_Jyac,6570400,6576560,do that you're my lead and you'll be  fine all right  when stanley came to a set of two open
lCinmh_Jyac,6576560,6581880,doors he entered the door on his left
lCinmh_Jyac,6582719,6588560,i don't know my left from right  no why did you do it oh [ __ ] quickly  hurry back in the other direction
lCinmh_Jyac,6588560,6594880,perhaps  open it up  look at this filing cap what happened to  that boy my bad my fault my fault my
lCinmh_Jyac,6594880,6600800,fault  okay i'll go through it again
lCinmh_Jyac,6602159,6608960,oh no change all right  oh it's ruined oh i can't believe after
lCinmh_Jyac,6608960,6614800,everything we talked about that you my  story you've destroyed my work why for
lCinmh_Jyac,6614800,6620800,what what did you get out of that my bad  what did you think was so special about  seeing the game my fault left here like
lCinmh_Jyac,6620800,6626239,so much garbage i'm sorry it's worthless  now  and what am i supposed to do even if
lCinmh_Jyac,6626239,6632400,there were a way to continue would it be  worth it to know that my story is now  incorrect how can i go back to that i
lCinmh_Jyac,6632400,6638719,can't erase that knowledge i'll have to  live with it forever reliving its  impossibility forever i couldn't live
lCinmh_Jyac,6638719,6645440,that way is it better to shut the game  down entirely to willingly destroy all  of my work i don't know
lCinmh_Jyac,6645440,6652159,what's the answer what do i do what do i  do what do i  no i have to i have to shut the game
lCinmh_Jyac,6652159,6658159,down i have to wait no don't actually  come on  i
lCinmh_Jyac,6658159,6662040,buy what
lCinmh_Jyac,6667599,6672800,steve look what you did now  [Music]  we're done blue screen to death this
lCinmh_Jyac,6672800,6677840,[ __ ]  i'm here i'm still here here in this
lCinmh_Jyac,6677840,6683280,pile of rubbish with you you  who thought you were so clever
lCinmh_Jyac,6683280,6688639,now look where we are  my entire game is destroyed  it was the only thing in the world that
lCinmh_Jyac,6688639,6694960,was mine and you'd run it into the  ground  what did you think that would be funny  it's kind of funny just had to see
lCinmh_Jyac,6694960,6701440,didn't i impress upon you how important  it was to be like stanley he actually  knows how to do what i tell him to he
lCinmh_Jyac,6701440,6708080,understands that if i say to do  something there's a damn good reason for  it  that thought hadn't even occurred to you
lCinmh_Jyac,6708080,6714159,had it  that there's a world outside of you  you're a child hey
lCinmh_Jyac,6714159,6719760,oh  my god don't take don't take out your  flawed story on me
lCinmh_Jyac,6719760,6724800,on the left you would have seen it there  was a whole underground facility you  would have destroyed i already did that
lCinmh_Jyac,6724800,6730320,victorious it would have been so perfect  i worked so hard on it i tried so hard
lCinmh_Jyac,6730320,6736560,to make  is behave exactly as stanley that means
lCinmh_Jyac,6736560,6743119,choosing responsibly and always putting  the story first you got it boss i'm sure  you'll be up to the task just follow my
lCinmh_Jyac,6743119,6748719,lead and you'll be fine all right  when stanley came to a set of two open
lCinmh_Jyac,6748719,6755199,doors he entered the door on his left  stupid idiot
lCinmh_Jyac,6755199,6761360,no why did you do that quickly hurry oh  dude
lCinmh_Jyac,6761360,6764638,exactly a standard
lCinmh_Jyac,6773440,6779040,when stanley came to a set of two open  doors he entered the door on his right
lCinmh_Jyac,6779040,6785920,i'll do it again [ __ ]  no why did you do that quickly hurry up
lCinmh_Jyac,6788320,6795760,i don't think the game wants me to do it  oh no it's just restarting you behave  exactly as stanley would that means no
lCinmh_Jyac,6795760,6802080,do i have to go left exactly as standing  would that means  i even went left i went left is that
lCinmh_Jyac,6802080,6807360,good enough exactly a stanley wood that  means how do i get out of this
lCinmh_Jyac,6807360,6812880,it's behaving exactly as stanley [ __ ]  that means oh my god
lCinmh_Jyac,6812880,6819679,is behaving exactly as stupid  that means  crazy i was crazy once exactly i can't
lCinmh_Jyac,6819679,6824719,do anything  is behaving we gotta do it it's just
lCinmh_Jyac,6824719,6830080,gonna keep going i've waited long enough  i tried to wait it
lCinmh_Jyac,6830760,6836400,[Music]  okay all of his co-workers were gone
lCinmh_Jyac,6836400,6842080,what could it mean  stanley decided to go to the meeting  room perhaps he had simply missed a memo
lCinmh_Jyac,6842080,6848400,okay perhaps he wanted to stop by the  employee lounge first just to admire it
lCinmh_Jyac,6848400,6853920,and here it was  the lounge  what a room stanley thought to himself
lCinmh_Jyac,6853920,6859440,what a room what a room what a room  this is what stanley thought
lCinmh_Jyac,6859440,6866159,what a room sounds like it what a room  what a room  what a room
lCinmh_Jyac,6867840,6875040,what is happening but eager to get back  to business  the first open door on his left no
lCinmh_Jyac,6875040,6880480,or should i i don't know i just want to  get to the  there's like a little vent
lCinmh_Jyac,6880480,6887119,and it leads  oh man am i going to do this again all  right let's just see what happens i was  so bad at following directions it's
lCinmh_Jyac,6887119,6892239,terrible it wasn't five years ago oh  perfect
lCinmh_Jyac,6892239,6897920,oh we did it i didn't realize that that  was there okay  you're getting close now stanley what's
lCinmh_Jyac,6897920,6903840,got baby we've gotten older we need more  and marines  said something about stairs and then the
lCinmh_Jyac,6903840,6910080,first number will equal the second  number and that will be it  we'll be different people by then
lCinmh_Jyac,6910080,6916880,different in the sense that we used to  have none of them amen and now we have  them all you can't go back to when you
lCinmh_Jyac,6916880,6921520,had no fiddler and marines none of us  can
lCinmh_Jyac,6922880,6929480,alright and the last one said something  about stairs so what's through here
lCinmh_Jyac,6933520,6939199,stanley had now gotten himself so far  off the beaten path that it seemed the  office had begun i'm so far off the
lCinmh_Jyac,6939199,6945520,beaten path oh no seen the office had  begun from so far off the beaten path  that it seemed the office had begun from
lCinmh_Jyac,6945520,6949760,so far off the beaten path that it  seemed
lCinmh_Jyac,6950639,6956320,what have i done  you didn't think i was actually just a  recording did you for a second
lCinmh_Jyac,6956320,6962000,explanation that would be all the back  and forth between you and me all the  absurd adventures we've been through and
lCinmh_Jyac,6962000,6967440,it all turns out i'm just a tape  recording it was all just in stanley's  head
lCinmh_Jyac,6967440,6973679,i bet that's the kind of twist you think  is revelatory all right each and every  time you watch a movie where it turns
lCinmh_Jyac,6973679,6979040,out all to be in the main character's  imagination  well with your own voice
lCinmh_Jyac,6979040,6984080,in pure shock at the phenomenal and  intricate storytelling it must be so
lCinmh_Jyac,6984080,6990560,simple to be you  life being an unending waterfall of  surprises and delights
lCinmh_Jyac,6990560,6995679,how much more exciting you must find the  world than the rest of us do
lCinmh_Jyac,6995679,7002080,the opposite you know it becomes sad  look what you've done today don't trip  me fault  you're so good at guilt you're
lCinmh_Jyac,7002080,7009360,ridiculous you know that  stupid narrator dummy dumb idiot this  was a face and stanley decided that as
lCinmh_Jyac,7009360,7015440,soon as he found a new space  this is important that he would never  leave it again we have the meeting we're  gonna go to the meeting room when
lCinmh_Jyac,7015440,7021599,stanley came to a set of two open here  he entered the door on his left  yeah you're what you're lucky i'm
lCinmh_Jyac,7021599,7028639,following the rules this time because i  need to see this here we go  something to do with stairs okay
lCinmh_Jyac,7028639,7034560,stairs where have the stairs been where  are stairs beware the false pro what is  this game dude i don't even know what
lCinmh_Jyac,7034560,7040320,this is anymore what else do we know  where could they be trust the
lCinmh_Jyac,7040320,7047118,completionist instinct i will i'll trust  it  all right

lCinmh_Jyac,7053119,7059280,part of this i'm not going to encourage  you i'm not going to say anything at all  i'm just going to be patient and wait
lCinmh_Jyac,7059280,7066239,for you to finish whatever it is you  enjoy doing stairs in this room coming  to a staircase stanley walked upstairs
lCinmh_Jyac,7066239,7072000,to his boss's office  is there something i'm missing in here
lCinmh_Jyac,7072000,7077440,no i don't want to go up there again  i want to go down here was there was  there one down here last time i can't
lCinmh_Jyac,7077440,7084480,remember  and there it is let's go the most stigly
lCinmh_Jyac,7084480,7089920,wiggly savor this moment stan  is a real accomplishment this is doing
lCinmh_Jyac,7089920,7095599,something just for the sake of doing it  what about this so many people expect to  be rewarded for the most trivial
lCinmh_Jyac,7095599,7101440,achievement they set it on the wall  you've insisted that a job well done is  its own reward
lCinmh_Jyac,7101440,7107679,i would tell you that i'm proud of you  for collecting them all but that would  be like a reward and we can't have that
lCinmh_Jyac,7107679,7112880,so instead i'll just say it's done we're  all done here and now we can go to
lCinmh_Jyac,7112880,7118239,whatever the hell you were doing before  you hunted for figurines
lCinmh_Jyac,7126400,7129840,i'm gonna go jump off something
lCinmh_Jyac,7133199,7139679,hey wait a minute  stanley i'm sorry but i have to put a  pause on let me go do it it's those
lCinmh_Jyac,7139679,7146159,figurines oh okay please i haven't  stopped thinking about them since you  nabbed every line either
lCinmh_Jyac,7146159,7151599,wasn't it just the most intrinsically  fulfilling moment of your entire would  be a bit better if i got like cash or
lCinmh_Jyac,7151599,7158080,something with inner richness  yes i know we're supposed to be telling  a story but won't you please indulge me
lCinmh_Jyac,7158080,7164719,with one more trip back to the memory  zone  i would love nothing more than to  revisit the figurines i would love that
lCinmh_Jyac,7164719,7170560,just one more time  nice
lCinmh_Jyac,7170560,7174719,look at this  this is wonderful
lCinmh_Jyac,7179520,7185840,oh  what's this  new
lCinmh_Jyac,7185920,7191199,the figurines all began  the first collectible back then we had
lCinmh_Jyac,7191199,7197920,no idea of how many of them we'd find  sure it's at six right there on the  screen but how could we know for certain
lCinmh_Jyac,7197920,7203440,we were so innocent  we'll never be like that again stanley
lCinmh_Jyac,7203440,7210840,i agree  seven out of six what is this what the  hell
lCinmh_Jyac,7212159,7214800,what's happening
lCinmh_Jyac,7219679,7227199,and here was a second stanley yeah you  found this one already just by poking
lCinmh_Jyac,7228960,7234320,i'll be honest back then i had no faith  okay to find any officer
lCinmh_Jyac,7234350,7240960,[Music]  okay let's do a little quiz which of  these rooms was the room you found your
lCinmh_Jyac,7240960,7247520,third mini stand it was the boss's  office  because it was right behind the thing
lCinmh_Jyac,7247520,7250159,i remember
lCinmh_Jyac,7252800,7259199,it was right hey  there's over here exactly right it was  here yeah behind the boss's office it
lCinmh_Jyac,7259199,7265599,was the third one that's great picked it  up and then after that you had three of  them i did i'm glad these moments are so
lCinmh_Jyac,7265599,7272320,crystal clear in your memory but i  shouldn't be surprised after all science  tells us that it's impossible to forget
lCinmh_Jyac,7272320,7275920,your third time doing anything
lCinmh_Jyac,7279599,7285040,let's see what came next not this yes we  found a fig in this pink room no we
lCinmh_Jyac,7285040,7290560,didn't oh well i can't actually say i  remember being in this room i'm not  picking that one up memory zone so it
lCinmh_Jyac,7290560,7297280,must have happened  it was over here you can't fool me  i remember where it was this was the
lCinmh_Jyac,7297280,7304159,fifth minister and this one was really  something this was the fifth one in the  warehouse i remember it so clearly but
lCinmh_Jyac,7304159,7311360,what about before because this one is  particularly special to me i made a  little video to commemorate the occasion
lCinmh_Jyac,7311360,7316719,enjoy  [Music]  no [ __ ]
lCinmh_Jyac,7316719,7321560,no shot this is in the video
lCinmh_Jyac,7324320,7331119,this  this  [Music]
lCinmh_Jyac,7331119,7336239,this is the greatest  deluxe version of any game i've ever
lCinmh_Jyac,7336239,7342800,played  this just goes above and beyond
lCinmh_Jyac,7343520,7349520,the windows movie maker parody  holy [ __ ]
lCinmh_Jyac,7349520,7353840,this is the greatest game ever
lCinmh_Jyac,7354800,7361520,this throws me back so much  ah  takes you back it [ __ ] dies there's a
lCinmh_Jyac,7361520,7367280,lot of time making that video but it was  eight minutes i wouldn't have spent on  anything else but what about wait a
lCinmh_Jyac,7367280,7372239,minute this was my fifth one  right
lCinmh_Jyac,7372480,7378000,oh god i can't remember  whatever i just know that one was false
lCinmh_Jyac,7378000,7384880,wait  that was the false prophet  the one i didn't pick up in the pink
lCinmh_Jyac,7385679,7390199,unless i just [ __ ] up  [Music]
lCinmh_Jyac,7392080,7399040,and then stanley then we came to the  last collectible the final figurine  right here under the stairs this memory
lCinmh_Jyac,7399040,7404960,is the most distinct and clear yeah  perhaps because it was the one that  happened this is the same we never
lCinmh_Jyac,7404960,7411440,picked up the third or fourth truly say  how the mind works okay all i know is  that this is the moment where you picked
lCinmh_Jyac,7411440,7417199,up a fig and i thought to myself yes  that's all of them they're all collected
lCinmh_Jyac,7417199,7425599,it was a moment unlike any other  except for the other moments picking up  figurines which it was exactly like
lCinmh_Jyac,7425599,7432760,we didn't pick up the blue door one  or the red door i forget which one
lCinmh_Jyac,7433950,7441920,[Music]  no way there was no more because we've
lCinmh_Jyac,7441920,7449760,caught up to the present moment nothing  left to do but move onward into the  future goodbye memory zone
lCinmh_Jyac,7449760,7455280,okay  all right  um
lCinmh_Jyac,7455280,7460480,no no no i'm not done i'm not ready to  move on stop the loading screen isn't
lCinmh_Jyac,7460480,7465599,there some way we can stay here keep  enjoying these figurines go backwards
lCinmh_Jyac,7465599,7470719,we'll do the memory zone again from the  opposite version see how that feels
lCinmh_Jyac,7470719,7475760,this is important right you told me to  remember this  this is
lCinmh_Jyac,7475760,7484000,oh [ __ ] okay uh what do i  um okay we'll go back i guess
lCinmh_Jyac,7484000,7491040,can't go up the stairs  okay yes that spot under the stairs i  remember this i must say of all the
lCinmh_Jyac,7491040,7498079,figurines we looked at in our initial  tour of the memory zone this one is the  most distinct and clear in my mind let's
lCinmh_Jyac,7498079,7505040,keep going i want more i'm not i'm not  picking it up  and here's where i made that video don't
lCinmh_Jyac,7505040,7510639,you remember i remember i'm not picking  this one up  goddamn
lCinmh_Jyac,7510639,7516960,okay jesus christ all right  all right  all right i get it
lCinmh_Jyac,7518000,7523840,still don't remember the pink room  stanley because it doesn't exist this  one good room though a solid room i'm
lCinmh_Jyac,7523840,7529599,not touching it  the apple is a lie these really were a  treat to hunt down you know if there
lCinmh_Jyac,7529599,7534960,have been any kind of rewards  it really would have muted the intrinsic
lCinmh_Jyac,7534960,7540880,joy of collecting them i'm very glad we  resisted the temptation next one okay i
lCinmh_Jyac,7540880,7548599,guess we go over  here to the red blue door we never  grabbed this one so
lCinmh_Jyac,7549119,7555360,or not i guess we don't have to go that  way we could just go back uh  [Music]
lCinmh_Jyac,7555360,7563440,to the bathroom  this was our second fig don't you  remember yeah i remember it too the past
lCinmh_Jyac,7563440,7570880,is truly a wonderful thing why does  anyone ever choose to leave it keep  going this is it the very first one we
lCinmh_Jyac,7570880,7577599,found in the exhibit where i actually  introduced you to the fig i'm just gonna  go oh i want more memories stanley i
lCinmh_Jyac,7577599,7585199,want to keep going what else is there  what came before this this definitely  wasn't this wasn't the thing oh my god
lCinmh_Jyac,7585199,7590320,look it's the terrible new content that  we were originally so long i remember
lCinmh_Jyac,7590320,7597599,hating it  but time does put a rosy filter on  everything in fact i dare say i'm oh yes
lCinmh_Jyac,7597599,7605400,the two doors who could have forgotten  that a classic memory this one um
lCinmh_Jyac,7606159,7611119,each one  i have no choice
lCinmh_Jyac,7611440,7616158,and before everything else there was  your office
lCinmh_Jyac,7617440,7622719,anything else was there something that  came before your office  there's something i feel i can remember
lCinmh_Jyac,7622719,7628560,we did a lot of [ __ ] buddy remember  uh-oh
lCinmh_Jyac,7629119,7634239,yes i'm remembering something now i  remember before this whole story got
lCinmh_Jyac,7634239,7639840,started back then i was  i was different  i used to make big decisions i was
lCinmh_Jyac,7639840,7646639,passionate i was skeptical i weighed  each decision with profound  thoughtfulness and then somewhere along
lCinmh_Jyac,7646639,7652400,the way i stopped making decisions  i became lazy and i came up with well
lCinmh_Jyac,7652400,7658159,came up with a character named stanley  to do my thinking for me he would make  the decisions he would decide which way
lCinmh_Jyac,7658159,7663679,to go  i would cheer him on as he collected  figurines for no reason why did i invent
lCinmh_Jyac,7663679,7669520,stan there  was i lonely yes perhaps that's it  perhaps i needed to imagine i had
lCinmh_Jyac,7669520,7676159,companionship and stanley really did  make for a wonderful companion even if  he was a fiction
lCinmh_Jyac,7676159,7681199,but i suppose it's grown old i  i want to think for myself again
lCinmh_Jyac,7681199,7688079,i want to go back to how it used to be  yes i can be on my own again i can do it
lCinmh_Jyac,7688079,7696320,i'll be stronger this time i'll take  care of myself i don't need stanley  anymore oh but he truly was so much fun
lCinmh_Jyac,7696320,7703679,to play with  you know what  since we're in the memory zone how about  one more good memory sure let's go back
lCinmh_Jyac,7703679,7708800,just once and give stanley one more run  of the office and then i'll retire him
lCinmh_Jyac,7708800,7714719,for good i did enjoy telling his story  so very much  okay
lCinmh_Jyac,7714719,7721599,here we go this is the story of a man  named stanley
lCinmh_Jyac,7726000,7731679,all right  one last run  you guys had never seen the office this
lCinmh_Jyac,7731679,7737440,brightly lit was it a sign of something  he hoped it was he hoped very much that
lCinmh_Jyac,7737440,7743360,it was  i'm gonna follow the rules stanley came  to a set of two open doors he entered
lCinmh_Jyac,7743360,7747198,the door on his left following the rules
lCinmh_Jyac,7752000,7757360,yet there was not a single person here  either wait feeling a wave of disbelief
lCinmh_Jyac,7757360,7762880,stanley decided to go up to his boss's  office okay hoping he might find another  i can't even go in the broom closet
lCinmh_Jyac,7762880,7771119,anymore all right  coming to a staircase stanley walked  upstairs to his boss's office okay
lCinmh_Jyac,7771119,7777199,okay i think we all know the drill by  now blah blah blah dark secrets the  keypad stanley pushes some buttons oh
lCinmh_Jyac,7777199,7782760,hey look it's a new passage no way  surprise
lCinmh_Jyac,7789599,7797520,this is uh  this is something else  this whole game has been something
lCinmh_Jyac,7798840,7804000,else i'm so glad i waited straight ahead  i'm trying to talk about the red mind
lCinmh_Jyac,7804000,7811280,control  we're just doing it we're just doing it  we're gonna do it as the intended it's  fine  this game i'm so glad i actually like
lCinmh_Jyac,7811280,7818159,waited to play this game in a more full  fashion for like a video  the lights rose on an enormous room
lCinmh_Jyac,7818159,7823199,packed with television  what horrible secret did this place hold
lCinmh_Jyac,7823199,7829040,stanley thought to himself did he have  the strength to find out  i do
lCinmh_Jyac,7829040,7836480,i do have the strength  now the monitors jump to life their true
lCinmh_Jyac,7836480,7841520,nature revealed each bore the number of  an employee in the building stanley's
lCinmh_Jyac,7841520,7849760,co-workers the lives of so many  individuals reduced to images on a  screen and stanley one of them eternally
lCinmh_Jyac,7849760,7855480,monitored in this place where freedom  meant nothing
lCinmh_Jyac,7857679,7863360,this mind control facility it was too  horrible to believe it couldn't be true
lCinmh_Jyac,7863360,7869199,had stanley really been under someone's  control all this one last run was this  the only reason he was happy with his
lCinmh_Jyac,7869199,7876000,boring job that his emotions had been  manipulated to accept it blindly
lCinmh_Jyac,7877119,7884000,no  he refused to believe it he couldn't  accept it his own life in someone else's
lCinmh_Jyac,7884000,7889040,control  never it was unthinkable wasn't it was
lCinmh_Jyac,7889040,7898159,it even possible  had he truly spent his entire life  utterly blind to the world
lCinmh_Jyac,7898159,7907040,but here was the proof the heart of the  operation controls labeled with  importance happy or sad or content
lCinmh_Jyac,7907040,7912800,walking eating working all of it  monitored and completed
lCinmh_Jyac,7912800,7920159,and as the cold reality of his past  began to sink in stanley decided that  this machinery would never again exert
lCinmh_Jyac,7920159,7928000,its terrible power over another human  life  for he  would dismantle the controls once and
lCinmh_Jyac,7928000,7933198,for all  what if i hit on
lCinmh_Jyac,7933760,7939679,no i have to listen i don't want to know  i don't want to know what happens if i  hit on
lCinmh_Jyac,7939679,7947520,i'm listening to the story for the one  last run for the sake of the narrator  for the sake of the game
lCinmh_Jyac,7948320,7951880,we will do it
lCinmh_Jyac,7953410,7958739,[Music]
lCinmh_Jyac,7960159,7965360,blackness  and a rising chill of uncertainty
lCinmh_Jyac,7965360,7971040,was it over  [Music]
lCinmh_Jyac,7971040,7976239,yes  he had won again he had defeated the  machine
lCinmh_Jyac,7976239,7983040,unshackled himself from someone else's  command freedom was mere moments away
lCinmh_Jyac,7983040,7989440,and yet  even as the immense door slowly opened  stanley reflected on how many puzzles
lCinmh_Jyac,7989440,7996400,still lay unsold there's still too many  i bet his co-workers gone  how had he been freed from the machine's
lCinmh_Jyac,7996400,8002880,grass what other mysteries did this  strange building hold  but as sunlight streamed into the
lCinmh_Jyac,8002880,8010800,chamber he realized none of this  mattered to him for it was not knowledge  or even power that he had been seeking
lCinmh_Jyac,8010800,8017280,but happiness  perhaps his goal had not been to  understand  but to let go
lCinmh_Jyac,8017280,8023040,no longer would anyone tell him where to  go what to do  or how to feel
lCinmh_Jyac,8023040,8029840,whatever life he lives it will be his  and that was all he needed to know
lCinmh_Jyac,8029840,8038840,it was perhaps the only thing worth  knowing  stanley stepped through the open door
lCinmh_Jyac,8039760,8045599,before i do  i just want to say thank you so much for  watching if you've watched this far
lCinmh_Jyac,8045599,8052480,i really do appreciate the fact that  you even decided to watch the whole  video and even if you decided to watch
lCinmh_Jyac,8052480,8058800,it in multiple parts you know 10 minute  sessions 15 20 minutes or even just  binge the whole thing i really do
lCinmh_Jyac,8058800,8065440,appreciate it i'm glad you guys enjoy  these types of videos i know i don't do  them often  but they're always a real treat to
lCinmh_Jyac,8065440,8070880,finally sit down and play a game  that i either haven't played or haven't  played in a really long time and really
lCinmh_Jyac,8070880,8078000,just be blown away it's just amazing and  i want to say thank you and if you  enjoyed this video on stanley parable uh
lCinmh_Jyac,8078000,8083040,the deluxe version i guess make sure to  leave a like on this video i would very  much appreciate it if you have any
lCinmh_Jyac,8083040,8089040,suggestions for other games i should  play on the channel please do leave them  down in the comment section below i  believe this is going to be the end of
lCinmh_Jyac,8089040,8095360,the video  as i walk through here he said there's  going to be this is the last run  apparently so i feel like this is a good
lCinmh_Jyac,8095360,8101599,point to get this all out now uh if  you're new to the channel or find  yourself coming back on the regular uh
lCinmh_Jyac,8101599,8106800,and you're not subscribed why not you're  already coming back anyway i don't  usually do videos like this so this
lCinmh_Jyac,8106800,8112560,isn't my regular content but they come  around once in a while like i said my  last super liminal video
lCinmh_Jyac,8112560,8118800,i did like a game like this was like  eight or nine months ago so it's been  quite a while and i i hope you enjoyed
lCinmh_Jyac,8118800,8124800,this video because uh  i know i certainly enjoyed recording it  it was a lot of fun and uh
lCinmh_Jyac,8124800,8132000,yeah  thank you so much for watching  uh and i guess this is it
lCinmh_Jyac,8133520,8138960,stanley felt the cool breeze upon his  skin  the feeling of liberation
lCinmh_Jyac,8138960,8145280,the immense possibility of the new path  before him  this was exactly the way
lCinmh_Jyac,8145280,8151360,right now  that things were meant to happen  and stanley
lCinmh_Jyac,8151360,8156840,was happy we're happy again for the  second time
lCinmh_Jyac,8165199,8171840,god damn honestly i really hate to leave  a game like this on  perhaps there's so much more i haven't
lCinmh_Jyac,8171840,8179360,really uh  explored or done or found out about  there's probably so many more endings  this i can't even fathom but honestly i
lCinmh_Jyac,8179360,8184719,feel like this has gone on long enough i  feel like i've done most of the stuff i  wanted to do in the game and uh yeah
lCinmh_Jyac,8184719,8191040,i've truly i feel like i've experienced  it so i feel like it's a good point to  wrap it up but with these games you just
lCinmh_Jyac,8191040,8197678,never know it's it's so hard to leave  them but uh yeah thank you again for  watching to the dev team if you end up
lCinmh_Jyac,8197678,8204000,seeing this video uh thank you very much  for making such a fantastic game and i'm  sure there's a lot more that i didn't
lCinmh_Jyac,8204000,8210240,get to experience but hopefully if you  guys decide to pick up the game maybe  you enjoy it you know maybe you could
lCinmh_Jyac,8210240,8215840,discover something that i never did  uh and i'm so sure there's gonna be some  you out there who are like oh we didn't
