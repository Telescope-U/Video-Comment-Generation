yXvkZqURv_E,3199,8880,if the lion is the king of the jungle  how can he be the king of the jungle
yXvkZqURv_E,8880,14160,if he's not the biggest  he can't be the fastest because that's a
yXvkZqURv_E,14160,20080,cheater  he can't be the smartest  so he's not the biggest the fastest or
yXvkZqURv_E,20080,26800,the smartest  so how does the lion  become the king of the jungle
yXvkZqURv_E,26800,33599,his mentality  that's the only difference of a lion and  an elephant
yXvkZqURv_E,33680,38800,when a lion walks up and sees an  elephant he thinks lunch
yXvkZqURv_E,40640,46719,and it's all mentality  he may be outnumbered by a pack of
yXvkZqURv_E,46719,55440,hyenas  but i'm king  of my jungle because of my mentality
yXvkZqURv_E,56879,62719,my number one competition is me it's  always you versus you you got to be the  one to get up every morning be
yXvkZqURv_E,62719,70640,disciplined put in the consistent daily  hard work because that gains success no  coach no trainer no mentor no boss can
yXvkZqURv_E,70640,73840,do it you versus you
yXvkZqURv_E,76080,83360,life will not always be said  life is the ultimate competitor
yXvkZqURv_E,83360,88720,it's relentless  it will continue to attack me at least  expected
yXvkZqURv_E,88720,95520,we must learn to adapt and overcome to  any and all obstacles that are in front  of us
yXvkZqURv_E,95520,102159,we have to be wrong  if you want a thing bad enough to go out
yXvkZqURv_E,102159,108079,and fight for it to work day and night  for it to give up your time your peace
yXvkZqURv_E,108079,114720,and your sleep for it  if all that you dream and scheme is  about it and life seems useless and
yXvkZqURv_E,114720,121600,worthless without it and if you gladly  sweat forward and fretboard and plan for  it and lose all your terror of the
yXvkZqURv_E,121600,128800,opposition for it and if you simply go  after that thing that you want with all  of your capacity strength and sagacity
yXvkZqURv_E,128800,133840,faith hope and confidence and stirring  pertinacity if neither cold poverty
yXvkZqURv_E,133840,138879,vanish or golf sickness or pain or body  and brain can keep you away from the
yXvkZqURv_E,138879,146320,thing that you want if darker and grim  you besiege and beset it with the help  of god you'll get it
yXvkZqURv_E,146320,151340,[Music]
yXvkZqURv_E,154319,160000,i want you to know something that the  bigger your dream is i want you to  understand the harder the grind there
yXvkZqURv_E,160000,167040,listen to me  luck is for leprechauns  and you ain't green
yXvkZqURv_E,167040,172720,i'm not bringing you i'm not bringing  you a fairy tale what i am telling you  is that if you're willing to go beast
yXvkZqURv_E,172720,179200,mode you can have whatever you want i'm  a living example you can start from  nothing
yXvkZqURv_E,179920,186560,said i want what all other men want  he said i guarantee you when i line up  and they line up i want what all other
yXvkZqURv_E,186560,193040,men want  i guarantee you when you line up in your  one-on-one battles you want what all  other men want the same way you want the
yXvkZqURv_E,193040,198239,victory they want the victory  i want what all other men want he said
yXvkZqURv_E,198239,204560,but when the pressure hits  when the opposition hits  when the challenge hits when the pain
yXvkZqURv_E,204560,209680,creeps in  when the uncertainty creeps in when it  cuts when the scars when the bruises
yXvkZqURv_E,209680,216239,come i want what all other men want  he said when the opposition and  adversity shows up i just wanted a
yXvkZqURv_E,216239,222080,little bit more than they wanted  and so that's how i conquer and that's  how nobody has ever beaten me yet
yXvkZqURv_E,222080,227280,i just want one thing from you  as great as you are as skilled as you
yXvkZqURv_E,227280,233840,are as talented as you are i just want  one thing from you  never allow life to make you forget why
yXvkZqURv_E,233840,239920,you do what you do  [Music]  lazy people do a little work and think
yXvkZqURv_E,239920,247360,they should be winning but winners work  as hard as possible and still worry if  they're being lazy
yXvkZqURv_E,248480,255599,you might not be a lion yet some of you  in this room you might be a ad you might  have small beginnings you might not have
yXvkZqURv_E,255599,263040,a lot of money you might not have a lot  of resources  but he's determined he's strong he has a
yXvkZqURv_E,263040,268800,dream and a goal and he'll do whatever  it takes and i need you to understand  that the bigger your dream is the
yXvkZqURv_E,268800,274320,earlier you're gonna have to get up  the longer you're gonna have to stay up  the bigger your dream is the more effort
yXvkZqURv_E,274320,281680,you're gonna have to put in you'll never  see it for those of you who are seventy  percent seventy percent peace mode 30
yXvkZqURv_E,281680,289040,gazelle that's just enough for that  other person i'll do you  when the obstacle gets in front of you
yXvkZqURv_E,289040,296280,don't let stop it  don't let it deter you  not get around
yXvkZqURv_E,305199,310960,me versus me  it means that i'm going to try to be the
yXvkZqURv_E,310960,317120,best that i can be the strongest the  fastest the smartest human being that i
yXvkZqURv_E,317120,322800,can become  that is what i'm going to go for  and it doesn't matter that i will not be
yXvkZqURv_E,322800,328880,better than others when i compare myself  to them no  i will look at others who do achieve
yXvkZqURv_E,328880,335919,greatness in a category and i will say  look at what is possible  how close can i get to that greatness
yXvkZqURv_E,335919,343039,how close can i get to that glory  but my glory  doesn't happen in front of a crowd
yXvkZqURv_E,343039,348880,it doesn't happen  in a stadium or on a stage there are no  medals handed out
yXvkZqURv_E,348880,355360,it happens in the darkness of the early  morning  in solitude
yXvkZqURv_E,357039,363199,only thing noble about victimhood is  overcoming it  you can understand that the only thing
yXvkZqURv_E,363199,369360,noble about  your life is going to be  what you show people is actually
yXvkZqURv_E,369360,376080,possible  okay we're all put here for a reason and  it's not to go over here and beat on
yXvkZqURv_E,376080,382639,this drum about what should be and  what's not fair  the world will never be fair
yXvkZqURv_E,382639,389199,the world will never ever be defeated  someone will always have an easier path  than you
yXvkZqURv_E,389199,394880,someone will always have a more  difficult path than you regardless of  how difficult you think your path is
yXvkZqURv_E,394880,402720,there's lots of people out there who  have had that same path and actually won  huge with that
yXvkZqURv_E,404960,410400,if we respect it the way we say we  respect him if we love it the way we say  we love it
yXvkZqURv_E,410400,415759,if we cherish it the way we say we  cherish it  every single day should be nothing less
yXvkZqURv_E,415759,423720,than excellence  you might not always be your best  but you can always bring me your best
yXvkZqURv_E,425759,431840,then claim  one victory that no one can ever take  away from me ever
yXvkZqURv_E,431840,437919,the victory that is earned every single  day because i will
yXvkZqURv_E,437919,441198,not  stop
yXvkZqURv_E,444639,450639,you ready  you're hopelessly average  you are not special
yXvkZqURv_E,450639,455440,you're just like everyone else  and yay
yXvkZqURv_E,456880,463360,because that means all you have to  believe about yourself is that you can  change that it is in your fundamental
yXvkZqURv_E,463360,468400,nature to grow and get better that we  all inside of us have this deep desire
yXvkZqURv_E,468400,474720,to get better  so i have a dream okay fantastic
yXvkZqURv_E,474720,483840,i have one question  what skills  does your dream require you to obtain
yXvkZqURv_E,483919,490960,if you want to  be great  if you want to play on a world stage
yXvkZqURv_E,490960,496639,you're going to pay an extraordinary  price to become the person that you want  to become
yXvkZqURv_E,496639,503120,after you lose or when you get knocked  out stay down there for a minute  understand why you lost what were the
yXvkZqURv_E,503120,508319,reasons why are you down here why did  you lose so every time i lost
yXvkZqURv_E,508319,515599,i stayed down for a second minutes hours  days but when i stood up i was different
yXvkZqURv_E,515599,521200,now you start putting the pieces that  are necessary to win over and over and
yXvkZqURv_E,521200,528160,over again  [Music]  we all have dreams  i had it when i was younger
yXvkZqURv_E,528160,535360,so i figured  the best place to make those dreams come  true  are in isolation
yXvkZqURv_E,535360,542880,so i walked into isolation  as dave the guidance  but i walked out of isolation
yXvkZqURv_E,542880,548000,when you become a savage  is in isolation
yXvkZqURv_E,548000,554640,you go in isolation  and that's when your mind changes that's  where your focus changes your dedication
yXvkZqURv_E,554640,561360,changes  this is a great strength
yXvkZqURv_E,561360,566800,gain focus  isolation is the key  to strengthening your mind come on
yXvkZqURv_E,566800,573920,savage  what do you do when a thousand other
yXvkZqURv_E,573920,580399,people want exactly what you want  what if you're not the only one that  wants what you want what if there are
yXvkZqURv_E,580399,586399,thousands of other people who want what  you want you have to outwork them
yXvkZqURv_E,586399,593040,you gotta all find them you gotta get up  earlier you gotta stay up later
yXvkZqURv_E,599440,604640,everybody's got a dream everybody's got  a goal  what's the plan and when you're trying
yXvkZqURv_E,604640,609920,to do something that you're truly  passionate about  there is no plan b
yXvkZqURv_E,609920,615680,think about that for a second michael  jordan won six nba championships with  the chicago bulls because he was
yXvkZqURv_E,615680,622880,committed to plan a not plan b  plan b sucks
yXvkZqURv_E,622880,629920,sometimes we get stuck in these  situations  where we start looking to other people
yXvkZqURv_E,629920,636800,for our self-esteem  and  sometimes we find ourselves looking in
yXvkZqURv_E,636800,642000,broken mirrors to get a reflection of  ourselves
yXvkZqURv_E,642800,648640,you are where you are  because of the choices you've made and  the skills that you've built period end
yXvkZqURv_E,648640,654160,of story  now why is that the best news ever
yXvkZqURv_E,654160,661200,because it means you're in control  you steered yourself to exactly this  point
yXvkZqURv_E,661200,667120,but now that you take that control back  and you recognize that you can go  anywhere you want become anyone you want
yXvkZqURv_E,667120,674600,to become that you're going to have to  put in the work  now you can decide whether you want to  put in that work or not
yXvkZqURv_E,675200,680320,until i get through it i'm gonna be a  better servant because of it there's  this quote that says you go through the
yXvkZqURv_E,680320,685440,storm and you're not supposed to be the  same person on the other side of the  storm because that's the purpose of the
yXvkZqURv_E,685440,690720,storm like when i go through it i'm like  man i'm gonna be a better servant better  leader better team member as a result of
yXvkZqURv_E,690720,697040,it i'm not gonna resist the opposition  i'm not gonna resist the adversity i'm  not gonna resist the challenge my
yXvkZqURv_E,697040,702640,favorite quote is the quote by dr king  that says you judge the character and  caliber of a person not by where they
yXvkZqURv_E,702640,710800,stand in times of comfort and  convenience you judge the character  caliber of a person by what they stand  in times of challenge and opposition
yXvkZqURv_E,710800,718320,everybody can smile when the sun out  everybody can be happy when they're  making money
yXvkZqURv_E,719360,725680,when that alarm clock goes off at four  or five in the morning your mind says no  you just say this is what we do it's
yXvkZqURv_E,725680,733040,what we do now because to get to where  you want to go the amount of pain  involved the amount of mental pain of
yXvkZqURv_E,733040,739600,how many times you're gonna have to do  something that you don't want to do to  get to where you want to go that's your
yXvkZqURv_E,739600,746399,new norm  i stopped saying i've gotta wait for
yXvkZqURv_E,746399,753360,good things to happen to me and i said  i'm gonna ride i'm going to fight i'm  going to work i'm going to press toward
yXvkZqURv_E,753360,759279,i'm going to learn i'm going to do  everything in my power every single day
yXvkZqURv_E,759279,764320,i'm going to do everything in my power  to become a victor not a victim now let
yXvkZqURv_E,764320,771440,me say this before i move forward and i  can't explain it but you better feel me  winners win and losers lose
yXvkZqURv_E,771440,778240,i can't explain it any better than that  i don't know how it happens but winners  win and if you create a culture of
yXvkZqURv_E,778240,785040,losing if you keep being a victim if you  keep letting losing happen to you if you  keep letting people do you and treat you
yXvkZqURv_E,785040,789720,any kind of way it's gonna become a  culture
yXvkZqURv_E,800560,807360,the way to win this game called life  is not  money  it's not fame
yXvkZqURv_E,807360,812399,it's not other people's  adoration  it is quite simply
yXvkZqURv_E,812399,817519,what you think about yourself when  you're by yourself
yXvkZqURv_E,817519,823199,it's fulfillment  fulfillment is working really hard
yXvkZqURv_E,823199,830320,to gain a set of skills that are of  value to you that allow you to serve not  only yourself but others
yXvkZqURv_E,830320,835600,if you do that if you work really hard  to become something to have a power
yXvkZqURv_E,835600,842320,building things whatever the power is  that you want and then you put it to use  in service of yourself and others you
yXvkZqURv_E,842320,848800,put it to use in service of something  bigger than you  then you'll have fulfillment then you'll
yXvkZqURv_E,848800,855199,have something that the ancient greeks  call techne  it's something that no one can take away  from you it's something born of a cold
yXvkZqURv_E,855199,860320,shower of working out in the gym of not  eating the thing that you want
yXvkZqURv_E,860320,867120,of getting out of bed immediately when  it's time getting up studying and  practicing long after it stopped being
yXvkZqURv_E,867120,873760,fun  that's fulfillment
yXvkZqURv_E,878079,883360,nobody is going to give you anything  that you have not earned
yXvkZqURv_E,883440,888560,nobody cares how tough your upbringing  was  nobody cares
yXvkZqURv_E,888560,895199,if you suffered some discrimination you  have to remember that whatever you've  gone through it pales in comparison to
yXvkZqURv_E,895199,901839,the hardships previous generations  endured and they overcame them and if  they overcame them you can overcome them
yXvkZqURv_E,901839,908320,too  [Music]  dreams without goals are just dreams and
yXvkZqURv_E,908320,914320,they ultimately fuel disappointment  so have dreams but have goals
yXvkZqURv_E,914320,921279,life goals yearly goals  monthly goals daily goals in order to
yXvkZqURv_E,921279,926880,achieve your goals you must apply  discipline and consistency
yXvkZqURv_E,926880,932000,you have to work at it every day you  have to plan every day hard work
yXvkZqURv_E,932000,935730,works  [Music]
yXvkZqURv_E,938839,946880,weakness do i have weakness  i am nothing but weakness
yXvkZqURv_E,946880,951920,i'm not naturally strong or fast or  flexible
yXvkZqURv_E,951920,956959,i'm certainly not the smartest person in  the world  now
yXvkZqURv_E,956959,962079,all that being said  i have a saying
yXvkZqURv_E,962079,968639,a person's strength is often their  biggest weakness  but their weaknesses can become
yXvkZqURv_E,968639,978519,strengths  me  i am weak in all those ways i am weak
yXvkZqURv_E,983120,988800,and everything goes against you until it  seems that you cannot hold on for a  minute longer
yXvkZqURv_E,988800,997560,never give up then but that is just the  place and time  that the tide will turn
yXvkZqURv_E,998480,1003839,never give up then and that is so  important when you're working on doing  the things you want to do and fulfilling
yXvkZqURv_E,1003839,1009519,your dream and things happen  there are times when your energy feels  so depleted
yXvkZqURv_E,1009519,1016079,that you want to give up that it looks  just totally impossible and i can tell  you from my own personal experience
yXvkZqURv_E,1016079,1021600,don't give up then  [Music]  that's when you've got to fall forward
yXvkZqURv_E,1021600,1027280,when life is kicking dirt in your face  don't give up then that's when most  people turn back
yXvkZqURv_E,1027280,1033319,and ladies and gentlemen that is what  gives your life meaning
yXvkZqURv_E,1042000,1051480,that you're gonna start working  on that dream  you're gonna work and nurture that idea
yXvkZqURv_E,1059550,1065679,[Music]  you need an antidote to suffering and
yXvkZqURv_E,1065679,1071440,it has to be deep and no deep moves you  tectonically and it's not a trivial  thing
yXvkZqURv_E,1071440,1076720,and but that's better than happiness  and maybe if you're lucky while you're
yXvkZqURv_E,1076720,1081919,pursuing that and while you're immersed  in it you get to be happy  and you should fall on your knees and be
yXvkZqURv_E,1081919,1088080,grateful for that when it happens you  know it's a gift it really is a gift  and it comes upon you unexpectedly your
yXvkZqURv_E,1088080,1093840,happiness  but  you aim to climb up hill to the highest
yXvkZqURv_E,1093840,1100160,peak you can possibly envision  and that's that's better than happiness
yXvkZqURv_E,1100160,1106720,the time is now for it to be okay to be  great people in this world shun people
yXvkZqURv_E,1106720,1111919,for being great for being a bright color  for standing out but the time is now to
yXvkZqURv_E,1111919,1118799,be okay  to be the greatest you  [Music]  the most important conversation is the
yXvkZqURv_E,1118799,1124559,one you have with yourself  you wake up with it you walk around with  it you go to bed with it
yXvkZqURv_E,1124559,1128399,eventually you act on it
yXvkZqURv_E,1130320,1136720,[Music]  when your mind knows it's not going to  quit and this is what i found out this
yXvkZqURv_E,1136720,1142880,is my 40 rule when your mind knows it's  not going to quit your body will adapt
yXvkZqURv_E,1142880,1148400,to whatever is in front of it  i don't accept that i am what i am and
yXvkZqURv_E,1148400,1153919,that that is what i am doomed to be  no
yXvkZqURv_E,1153919,1159520,i do not accept that  i'm fighting
yXvkZqURv_E,1159760,1166960,i'm struggling and i'm scraping and  kicking and clawing at those weaknesses
yXvkZqURv_E,1166960,1172559,to change them  that we as human beings are capable of
yXvkZqURv_E,1172559,1178000,anything and we don't need any special  kind of parents or tools to get there so
yXvkZqURv_E,1178000,1184440,engine with this  don't stop when you're tired stop when  you're done
yXvkZqURv_E,1193600,1199120,you must have faith  you've got to believe in yourself
yXvkZqURv_E,1199120,1205760,you've got to believe in your abilities  you've got to believe in your service  your company your ideas
yXvkZqURv_E,1205760,1212240,unquestionably  you've got to have faith  and that faith gives you patience
yXvkZqURv_E,1212240,1217280,that it's not going to happen as quickly  as you want it to happen  a lot of things are going to happen that
yXvkZqURv_E,1217280,1224080,will catch you off god  and so therefore you've got to deal with  and handle it as it comes
yXvkZqURv_E,1224080,1232519,and not only that  but that faith and patience  drives you into action
yXvkZqURv_E,1238720,1246720,it's about the daily labor  the many individual acts  the choices large and small that add up
yXvkZqURv_E,1246720,1253200,over time over a lifetime  to a lasting legacy
yXvkZqURv_E,1253200,1259280,that's what you want on your tombstone  it's about not being satisfied with
yXvkZqURv_E,1259280,1266640,the latest achievement the latest gold  star because the one thing  i know about a body of work is that it's
yXvkZqURv_E,1266640,1271679,never finished  it's cumulative it deepens and expands
yXvkZqURv_E,1271679,1277440,with each day  that you give your best  each day that you give back and
yXvkZqURv_E,1277440,1284640,contribute to the life of your community  you may have setbacks and you may have  failures but you're not done you're not

yXvkZqURv_E,1325039,1331760,day and what does it mean to you i want  you to ask yourself those two questions  every single day when you get tired when
yXvkZqURv_E,1331760,1337520,you're not feeling it when you don't  value it when you take it for granted  every single day why do i do this and
yXvkZqURv_E,1337520,1343039,what does it mean to you  because if you say you do it for a
yXvkZqURv_E,1343039,1348799,certain reason and it means something to  you every single day you'll come out and  you'll never cheat it and you'll cherish
yXvkZqURv_E,1348799,1353760,every single aspect of it for the  ability to become great
yXvkZqURv_E,1355840,1362000,the shortcut is a lie  the hack doesn't get you there

yXvkZqURv_E,1367600,1373600,stronger smarter faster healthier  better
yXvkZqURv_E,1373600,1381360,to reach goals and overcome obstacles  and be the best version of you possible  will not happen by itself
yXvkZqURv_E,1381360,1388320,it will not happen cutting corners  taking shortcuts or looking for the easy  way
yXvkZqURv_E,1388320,1395120,there is no easy way  there is only hard work late nights
yXvkZqURv_E,1395120,1401919,early mornings practice rehearsal  repetition study sweat blood toil
yXvkZqURv_E,1401919,1407200,frustration and discipline  it's one thing to be hungry it's another
yXvkZqURv_E,1407200,1413360,thing when you're starving for greatness  and starving for success  i know what it's like to operate every
yXvkZqURv_E,1413360,1418480,single day regardless of the success  that i've been a lucky son of a [ __ ] to  achieve i operate every day as if i'm
yXvkZqURv_E,1418480,1424320,starving  i can't get a break in life
yXvkZqURv_E,1424320,1429679,i hate that damn mentality but i can't  get a break  you aren't giving any breaks in life you
yXvkZqURv_E,1429679,1435440,make them for yourself  we are all being tested in life
yXvkZqURv_E,1435440,1442799,while my test is different than yours  you will be tested and how you face that  test and how you overcome that test
yXvkZqURv_E,1442799,1448559,determines the rest of your life  the one mentality that you must have in  life is that regardless of what's in
yXvkZqURv_E,1448559,1453600,front of you you still must grind  i'll never be in the olympics i'll never
yXvkZqURv_E,1453600,1458760,be a professional athlete but still i  grind
yXvkZqURv_E,1459039,1464559,i feel that most things i do  but still i grind
yXvkZqURv_E,1466720,1472840,i don't want to do halftime i do  but still i grind
yXvkZqURv_E,1475440,1481360,those people they'll put out goals  dreams and aspirations and what they  want to accomplish but you very rarely
yXvkZqURv_E,1481360,1486960,hear people say what they're willing to  sacrifice in order to make it happen  they'll tell you to go with a dream to
yXvkZqURv_E,1486960,1493039,aspiration they'll tell you they want to  be elite they'll tell you they want to  be great but they're not going to say  i'm going to stop going out on friday
yXvkZqURv_E,1493039,1498640,night  they're not going to say i'm a sacrifice  and i'm going to stay late they'll tell  you the goals the dreams and the
yXvkZqURv_E,1498640,1505279,aspirations but cats will very rarely  touch on what they gotta sacrifice in  order to make it happen because wherever
yXvkZqURv_E,1505279,1510320,their sacrifice is interconnected to  accountability
yXvkZqURv_E,1511679,1517840,and what i'm suggesting to you is pain  can be transformed into power with the
yXvkZqURv_E,1517840,1523919,intention to transform pain into power  you see what most people do
yXvkZqURv_E,1523919,1529440,is this is why most good people lose  they stumble and they fall and they
yXvkZqURv_E,1529440,1534880,become heartbroken or disappointed by  life's challenges that happens to every
yXvkZqURv_E,1534880,1545210,single one of us  [Music]
yXvkZqURv_E,1547120,1553120,i am where i am currently because i  didn't do x y and z and guess what that  it hurts a little bit
yXvkZqURv_E,1553120,1558240,that bothers us a little bit it's a hard  truth to accept but once you accept that
yXvkZqURv_E,1558240,1564880,truth you are able to then move forward  with the actions required to get you to
yXvkZqURv_E,1564880,1572799,where you want to go  your life  is the exact reflection of the choices
yXvkZqURv_E,1572799,1579200,you have made  love your life great you've made awesome
yXvkZqURv_E,1579200,1584880,choices  hate your life  i'm sorry

yXvkZqURv_E,1611039,1619559,[ __ ]  you can do this
yXvkZqURv_E,1628040,1631220,[Music]
yXvkZqURv_E,1634080,1639440,in other words when the outcome changes  and it's not what we want it to be and  it doesn't turn out the way we want it
yXvkZqURv_E,1639440,1644960,to turn out do we still value the thing  that we once said we value
yXvkZqURv_E,1645120,1651279,is our character still intact  right because we all know it character  is not something we inherit
yXvkZqURv_E,1651279,1657600,character something we got to wake up  every single day we gotta fight and we  gotta build it in the midst of our  position
yXvkZqURv_E,1657600,1662880,in the midst of challenges in the midst  of uncertainty we gotta wake up and we  gotta build i should tell guys all the
yXvkZqURv_E,1662880,1668559,time i don't care how tall your father  is you gotta do your own growing  in other words every single day we got
yXvkZqURv_E,1668559,1671760,to build our own character
yXvkZqURv_E,1675039,1681039,when they look in the mirror they're  just trying to see what's on the surface  but winning and losing wants to know
yXvkZqURv_E,1681039,1686399,what's inside of you it wants to know  what makes you tick it wants to know
yXvkZqURv_E,1686399,1692559,what your desires are once you know what  your ego is it wants to know what your  limitations are it wants to know what
yXvkZqURv_E,1692559,1700240,your mindset is it wants to know  everything about you because  winning does not lie
yXvkZqURv_E,1700240,1707360,when you look in the mirror  you can lie and see what's on the  surface cannot buy what's going on
yXvkZqURv_E,1707360,1715360,inside  discipline defeats the infinite excuses  that say not today not now i need a rest
yXvkZqURv_E,1715360,1722320,i'll do it tomorrow  what's the hack  how do you become stronger smarter
yXvkZqURv_E,1722320,1729600,faster healthier how do you become  better  how do you achieve true freedom
yXvkZqURv_E,1729600,1736440,there is only one way  the way of discipline
yXvkZqURv_E,1739840,1745360,you either are [ __ ] aren't  you either will or you can won't
yXvkZqURv_E,1745360,1750919,you're either going to become or you're  not going to become
yXvkZqURv_E,1759800,1765919,[Applause]  everything in our life is controlled by
yXvkZqURv_E,1765919,1771120,three decisions  [Music]
yXvkZqURv_E,1771120,1776480,i think one of the most powerful things  we deserve is have you become clear of  what the controlling force is that's
yXvkZqURv_E,1776480,1781840,controlling the quality of your life and  you and i both know it's not the amount  of money in your pocket it's not who you  know
yXvkZqURv_E,1781840,1787919,it's not even what you've been through  it's really the decisions you make  moment to moment
yXvkZqURv_E,1788720,1794799,the first one is what are you going to  focus on  what makes it hard is your lack of
yXvkZqURv_E,1794799,1800080,belief that it can happen for you  the fact of it is though it's very
yXvkZqURv_E,1800080,1806720,doable  see if but you got to change though  if you keep doing
yXvkZqURv_E,1806720,1811919,what you've been doing  you're gonna keep getting what you've  been getting
yXvkZqURv_E,1811919,1818399,so if you're in a place in your life and  you ain't happy with it  you have to change some things
yXvkZqURv_E,1818399,1823679,but you have to make a conscientious  decision that you're going to change
yXvkZqURv_E,1823679,1829120,and it's not dependent on anybody else  if you want to get better you have to
yXvkZqURv_E,1829120,1837039,find out what you're avoiding and what  you're afraid of and maybe what you're  disgusted by even  and you have to expose yourself to that
yXvkZqURv_E,1837039,1842559,voluntarily and you have to let that  change you  it's the easiest thing in the world to
yXvkZqURv_E,1842559,1848640,do all right i'm done but what's hard is  going yo yesterday i got nothing from
yXvkZqURv_E,1848640,1854720,working as hard as i could i'm gonna do  the same thing again today but i'm gonna  try to go harder
yXvkZqURv_E,1854720,1860320,here's the reality and you're you're  gonna feel the truth of this instantly
yXvkZqURv_E,1860320,1865360,most dreams never come true  most of the people that you know most of
yXvkZqURv_E,1865360,1870799,the dreams that you've had for yourself  they haven't come true  why not
yXvkZqURv_E,1870799,1875320,because they're brutally difficult
yXvkZqURv_E,1886159,1894159,the fall  it is goes back as a matter of fact to  extremely fundamental things that
yXvkZqURv_E,1894159,1900480,there is always a curious  tie at some point
yXvkZqURv_E,1900480,1906640,between the fall  [Music]  and the  creation
yXvkZqURv_E,1906640,1915120,taking this ghastly risk  is the condition of there being life
yXvkZqURv_E,1915600,1924080,you see for all  the life  is an act of faith and an act of gamble
yXvkZqURv_E,1925200,1932159,returning  is the motion of the dao returning is  the motion of the doubt so that all of
yXvkZqURv_E,1932159,1937919,us came from a divine spiritual essence  invisible everything in the world of
yXvkZqURv_E,1937919,1942960,form emanated from something that is  formless there was a split second when
yXvkZqURv_E,1942960,1950080,you went from non-being  to being  to be able to return
yXvkZqURv_E,1950080,1956720,to that place from which you came and  live your life  from the spiritual perspective
yXvkZqURv_E,1956720,1963440,and become a  god-realized being  another great poet t.s eliot
yXvkZqURv_E,1963440,1969200,once said  we shall  not cease from exploration
yXvkZqURv_E,1969200,1974399,and at the end of all  of our exploring will be to arrive where
yXvkZqURv_E,1974399,1981278,we started and to know the place  for the first time
yXvkZqURv_E,1982559,1989279,from the moment you come awake till the  moment you fall asleep  how many moments and how many actions
yXvkZqURv_E,1989279,1994960,and how many thoughts and how many  emotions  or how much percentage of it do you
yXvkZqURv_E,1994960,2002240,conduct consciously  this will determine the state of your  revolution right now
yXvkZqURv_E,2002559,2009279,your ambitions blind you to the nature  of reality  they illuminate some reality
yXvkZqURv_E,2009279,2014880,but one of the things that you might ask  yourself once you know that is that if  you're suffering dreadfully then one
yXvkZqURv_E,2014880,2020399,possibility is that  you're so fixed on a point
yXvkZqURv_E,2020399,2026480,the fact that you're so fixed on the  point that you're fixed on might be  integrally related to why things are
yXvkZqURv_E,2026480,2031080,going so catastrophically wrong
yXvkZqURv_E,2032000,2037519,do what you did in the beginning and  there won't be an end  because when you think it's the  beginning you behave differently than
yXvkZqURv_E,2037519,2043679,the end the meaning we associate to  things controls our entire lives we take  control of meaning it's the only thing
yXvkZqURv_E,2043679,2050320,we can control our lives we can't  control events  but the only way that that dream is  going to come true even over that long
yXvkZqURv_E,2050320,2055838,period of time is if you're going all  out every day
yXvkZqURv_E,2056398,2061599,fear fuels you  fear lets you know go get more  information fear let you know step a
yXvkZqURv_E,2061599,2067679,little later and study fear let you know  get up a little earlier fear let you  know ask for help fear is informing you
yXvkZqURv_E,2067679,2074888,it's not stopping you it's just another  emotion like love and compassion and  gratitude we just made it paralyze us
yXvkZqURv_E,2074888,2080960,[Music]
yXvkZqURv_E,2080960,2089040,not everything you want  everything you already have because what  you have is substantial
yXvkZqURv_E,2089040,2094398,the fact that you can walk  that's a blessing  the fact that you woke up that's another
yXvkZqURv_E,2094398,2100839,blessing the fact that you can see  think reason that's another blessing
yXvkZqURv_E,2100839,2106800,ability  to dream is a blessing  the the fact that you have an
yXvkZqURv_E,2106800,2114000,opportunity to get it right is another  blessing  the moment you take a step
yXvkZqURv_E,2114000,2120320,you do so on an act of faith because you  don't really know that the flaw is not  going to give under your feet  the moment you take a journey what an
yXvkZqURv_E,2120320,2125760,act of faith  the moment you enter into any kind of  human undertaking in relationship what
yXvkZqURv_E,2125760,2131760,an act of faith  but this is the most powerful thing that  could be done surrender
yXvkZqURv_E,2131760,2137980,but what does matter is your entire life  is being lived by your brain
yXvkZqURv_E,2137980,2144720,[Music]  you're more likely to believe something  negative than you are something positive
yXvkZqURv_E,2144720,2150800,now think about how that can echo  through your life  each of us has to realize that all of
yXvkZqURv_E,2150800,2156160,the beliefs that we have in our life  are choices
yXvkZqURv_E,2156160,2161920,when you change  the way you look at things  [Music]
yXvkZqURv_E,2161920,2168240,the things you look at change  expecting somebody else to change or
yXvkZqURv_E,2168240,2177119,something outside of you to get better  in order for you  to make your life work it's in here
yXvkZqURv_E,2177200,2182800,see fear doesn't stop me fear informs me  and when you get intimately connected
yXvkZqURv_E,2182800,2188400,with the fear i feel it and i'm moving  forward anyway i feel it and i'm gonna
yXvkZqURv_E,2188400,2193920,love anyway i feel it and i'm gonna  invest in me anyway i feel it and i'm
yXvkZqURv_E,2193920,2199599,gonna show up and play anyway when you  get connected with fear it becomes your  best friend and when you stand on the
yXvkZqURv_E,2199599,2205100,edge  you feel the breeze

yXvkZqURv_E,2288160,2293520,if you've been sitting around waiting  for somebody to discover you to pick you  to save you to rescue to give you your
yXvkZqURv_E,2293520,2299839,is something happening  like at some point you got to wake up
yXvkZqURv_E,2299839,2305520,and realize  you have to parent yourself
yXvkZqURv_E,2305520,2312720,your life is your responsibility  close your eyes retreat from your life
yXvkZqURv_E,2312720,2320800,disconnect from your body disconnect  from your environment disconnect from  your schedule and just give yourself an
yXvkZqURv_E,2320800,2327520,hour or 45 minutes or 20 minutes because  when you invest in yourself  you invest in your future and when you
yXvkZqURv_E,2327520,2332640,believe in yourself  you believe in possibilities and when  you believe in possibilities you believe
yXvkZqURv_E,2332640,2337839,in yourself and if you don't believe in  possibilities then you don't believe in  yourself and you don't believe in
yXvkZqURv_E,2337839,2343119,yourself you don't believe in  possibilities so then but if you have a  community a living organism
yXvkZqURv_E,2343119,2348240,where it's becoming the new normal  you want to join that living organism  you want to
yXvkZqURv_E,2348240,2355119,every every stride you make feeds the  living organism every stride every  effort you make
yXvkZqURv_E,2355119,2361680,to connect is is amazing because  that which we are seeking is seeking us
yXvkZqURv_E,2361680,2369119,[Music]  so the real question is what is it that  you can fall in love with enough
yXvkZqURv_E,2369119,2374960,that  makes all the fighting through the  negative voice and all of that worth it  so that's number one it's just to
yXvkZqURv_E,2374960,2383359,recognize that you've got a long  timeline ahead of him  so when you stop outsourcing
yXvkZqURv_E,2383359,2389359,your happiness your validation your  support all of it and you bring it back
yXvkZqURv_E,2389359,2395119,in  and you get responsible for it it sounds  scary it's so
yXvkZqURv_E,2395119,2400240,liberating because you could do anything  when you're responsible when you're the
yXvkZqURv_E,2400240,2407599,driver of your life when you're not  looking out to anybody else to fix it  for you can you ask for help of course
yXvkZqURv_E,2407599,2414480,but the buck stops with you you're the  one that has to do the work you're the  one who has to push your own ass you're
yXvkZqURv_E,2414480,2419839,the one who has to figure out what makes  you happy you're the one who has to  figure out and become self-aware about
yXvkZqURv_E,2419839,2424960,what you need and then you're the one  that has to  find whatever it is the courage of being
yXvkZqURv_E,2424960,2431200,humble enough to ask for help  that's the eternal problem of life and
yXvkZqURv_E,2431200,2438240,the problem is  there is the category of problems in  life and it ain't going anywhere and so
yXvkZqURv_E,2438240,2443359,the question is can you deal with the  whole category at the same time
yXvkZqURv_E,2443359,2449839,that's the thing that's how to be in the  world it's to deal with that category  all at the same time
yXvkZqURv_E,2450240,2455359,sacrifice what does that mean sacrifice  well  it's a discovery man it's the discovery
yXvkZqURv_E,2455359,2462400,of the future  [Music]  it's like the future is actually the  place where there is threat
yXvkZqURv_E,2462400,2469280,it's always going to be there so what do  you do  you make sacrifices in the present so  that the future is better
yXvkZqURv_E,2469280,2476319,right  [Music]  for stall  gratification now
yXvkZqURv_E,2476319,2481520,and it'll pay off  at a place in time that doesn't even  exist yet
yXvkZqURv_E,2481520,2487119,it's like who would have believed that  it's like that's a miracle that that  occurs and it's not like people just
yXvkZqURv_E,2487119,2492319,figure that overnight  most people aren't obsessed with their  goals because they don't believe they're
yXvkZqURv_E,2492319,2498240,worthy of them  it's easy to dream about what you want
yXvkZqURv_E,2498240,2503599,but in between where you are and what  you want  there's a tremendous amount of stuff you
yXvkZqURv_E,2503599,2509040,got to change and do  and if you have  a lot of trauma in your background
yXvkZqURv_E,2509040,2514319,you have been given the message over and  over and over even though it's not true
yXvkZqURv_E,2514319,2519599,that you don't deserve it that there's  something wrong with you  and if you don't
yXvkZqURv_E,2519599,2524880,at some point  be defiant against what the world or
yXvkZqURv_E,2524880,2530240,your caregivers or your past experience  has pounded into your brain incorrectly
yXvkZqURv_E,2530240,2536079,unfairly  you will forever be stuck with that  story
yXvkZqURv_E,2536079,2542319,pain plus reflection equals progress and  i think that that's incredibly  incredibly true and the human animal
yXvkZqURv_E,2542319,2548240,just needs that bit of pain it is the  compass that's going to allow you if you  reflect on why you're feeling that pain
yXvkZqURv_E,2548240,2553359,what you did wrong how you failed you  don't deflect you don't make it somebody  else's problem you really just look at
yXvkZqURv_E,2553359,2559280,how did i put this up if you look at  that and are willing to make the changes  you really will make progress i don't
yXvkZqURv_E,2559280,2565300,see a way to really have grand scale  change without the suffering that's the  truth
yXvkZqURv_E,2565300,2570479,[Music]
yXvkZqURv_E,2578210,2586160,[Music]  the idea is that nothing brings a better  world into being than the stated truth
yXvkZqURv_E,2586160,2591280,now you might have to pay a price for  that but that's fine you're going to pay  a price for every bloody thing you do
yXvkZqURv_E,2591280,2598079,and everything you don't do you don't  get to choose to not pay a price you get  to choose which poison you're going to
yXvkZqURv_E,2598079,2603680,take that's it  so if you're going to stand up for  something stand up for your truth it'll
yXvkZqURv_E,2603680,2609520,it'll shape you because people will  respond and object to tell you why  you're a fool and a biased [ __ ] and why
yXvkZqURv_E,2609520,2615359,you're ignorant and then if you listen  to them you'll be just that much less  like that the next time you say
yXvkZqURv_E,2615359,2621680,something if you do that for five years  you'll be so damn tough and articulate  and able to communicate and withstand
yXvkZqURv_E,2621680,2628960,pressure that you won't even recognize  yourself and then you'll be a force to  contend with you are not responsible for
yXvkZqURv_E,2628960,2636880,what happened to you  you survived what happened to you  but you do have a responsibility to heal
yXvkZqURv_E,2636880,2644400,yourself and to do the work to change so  that you can be the happy fulfilled  person that you were born to be
yXvkZqURv_E,2644400,2649440,can have a mindset that says  through my efforts
yXvkZqURv_E,2649440,2655920,my attitude  i can have an impact  on the situation
yXvkZqURv_E,2655920,2662240,that's the power that i have  that's where it begins begins with you
yXvkZqURv_E,2662240,2668400,self-confidence self-love  self-esteem  self-reliance
yXvkZqURv_E,2668400,2675280,self-awareness it all has the same self  you have to  give yourself
yXvkZqURv_E,2675280,2681359,those things  you want validation give it to yourself  you want to be cheered for give it to
yXvkZqURv_E,2681359,2686880,yourself if you want to feel supported  in life  start by giving those things to yourself
yXvkZqURv_E,2686880,2692400,because  the most important relationship that you  have  is the one you have with yourself and
yXvkZqURv_E,2692400,2697440,you work on it the least  you can have nothing
yXvkZqURv_E,2697440,2704640,and you can still have your own bag  you can have tremendous  problems and very real obstacles that
yXvkZqURv_E,2704640,2709760,you're facing  and you can have a mindset that says
yXvkZqURv_E,2709760,2715599,through my efforts  my attitude  i can have an impact
yXvkZqURv_E,2715599,2719839,on the situation that i'm in
yXvkZqURv_E,2727180,2730380,[Music]
yXvkZqURv_E,2736380,2793649,[Music]
yXvkZqURv_E,2797839,2803200,you're ready  to wake up you're going to wake up  and if you're not ready you're going to
yXvkZqURv_E,2803200,2808400,stay pretending that you're just a  little poor little me
yXvkZqURv_E,2809680,2814800,plans can be  debilitating  it's good to have a plan but it's more
yXvkZqURv_E,2814800,2821280,important that you have a purpose  if you have a purpose plans will evolve  things will happen plans will fall apart
yXvkZqURv_E,2821280,2827520,new things will come up  whatever has to happen will happen if  you hold on to a certain purpose
yXvkZqURv_E,2827520,2834160,other things will just serve that  purpose  [Music]
yXvkZqURv_E,2834160,2840000,you've got to let go  and let it happen  because if you don't
yXvkZqURv_E,2840000,2845680,you're going to be all clutched up  you're going to be constantly trying
yXvkZqURv_E,2845680,2850720,to do  [Music]  what can happen healthily only if you
yXvkZqURv_E,2850720,2857359,don't try  we face challenges and have things that
yXvkZqURv_E,2857359,2864800,come against us it's easy to start  dreading it thinking this is going to be  so hard how can i accomplish this dream
yXvkZqURv_E,2864800,2870400,i don't have the resources the  connections  yes there are seasons where we have to
yXvkZqURv_E,2870400,2878480,endure do the right thing when it's hard  in the depths of despair
yXvkZqURv_E,2880000,2885920,an idea is going to come to you it's  like good god who put this mess together  is it really worth it is it really worth
yXvkZqURv_E,2885920,2888640,the suffering
yXvkZqURv_E,2891040,2896880,and so the question is well are there  ways that you can act that make things  really much better and i think that's
yXvkZqURv_E,2896880,2904000,the question is can we have our cake and  eat it too can we have the being that  requires limitation and suffering and
yXvkZqURv_E,2904000,2909280,also simultaneously transcend that by  our mode of being
yXvkZqURv_E,2910559,2919359,you don't achieve  worthwhile goals  quickly or easily they take time
yXvkZqURv_E,2919359,2927520,they take struggle  they take  relentless pursuit day in and day out
yXvkZqURv_E,2927520,2934480,that's what it takes  and i also believe that we're going to  end up one day meeting a maker if you
yXvkZqURv_E,2934480,2941200,believe in one  and i believe that maker knows  everything about you  everything about you
yXvkZqURv_E,2941440,2947040,but you also have a choice to make  you have a choice to make we have  choices and the one thing that scares me
yXvkZqURv_E,2947040,2953680,to death in my life is getting to heaven  and  not being where i'm supposed to be
yXvkZqURv_E,2953680,2959040,and i believe that god has a chart and  he looks at the chart and he puts it in  front of you and you get to heaven he
yXvkZqURv_E,2959040,2966160,says hey this is what you're supposed to  be  and one of my biggest fears in life  was to see that chart
yXvkZqURv_E,2966160,2970680,and not have every block checked off
yXvkZqURv_E,2972720,2979680,dreams without goals are just dreams  and they ultimately fuel disappointment
yXvkZqURv_E,2979680,2987200,goals  on the road to achievement  cannot be achieved without discipline
yXvkZqURv_E,2987200,2993920,and consistency  is knowing what is your life worth what
yXvkZqURv_E,2993920,3000400,is it that gives your life a sense of  meaning and purpose  because once you find that
yXvkZqURv_E,3000400,3008240,it puts you in your power place  see if you know what your life work is i  encourage you to start working on it
yXvkZqURv_E,3008240,3013760,if you can't do it all at one time do  just a little bit of it  and if you don't know what it is that
yXvkZqURv_E,3013760,3020400,you showed up to do if you don't know  why you're here  i encourage you to find out what your
yXvkZqURv_E,3020400,3025720,purpose is here what is the meaning of  your life
yXvkZqURv_E,3026079,3031280,everything may not be perfect there are  things that need to change
yXvkZqURv_E,3031280,3038480,don't get so focused on what you want  that you miss the beauty of this day
yXvkZqURv_E,3039200,3045920,i want you to live the life you were  meant to live  you hear me some of you are not  transitioning
yXvkZqURv_E,3045920,3053119,because you're okay with the life you  have and i'm telling you i i when i walk  out i want to be an example of you can
yXvkZqURv_E,3053119,3059440,start from wherever and get to wherever  you want to get to that's what i'm  asking you to do what fuels you the
yXvkZqURv_E,3059440,3065599,reason why you're so lazy is not because  you don't have the ability you're so  lazy because your dreams so small
yXvkZqURv_E,3065599,3071040,because you've got this short time on  earth and there's lots of things that  are very very difficult to contend with
yXvkZqURv_E,3071040,3076559,and you have the problem of tolerating  yourself even in all your insufficiency
yXvkZqURv_E,3076559,3082000,one of the things that seems to me to be  the case is that if you adopt a  sufficiently profound motive being if
yXvkZqURv_E,3082000,3087680,you attempt to do that then the mere act  of lifting up that weight is enough to
yXvkZqURv_E,3087680,3095599,justify the fact that you're  insufficient and mortal and and and  bound by tragedy
yXvkZqURv_E,3095599,3102090,and i say to you that if you begin to  take a conscious effort to find out what  it is that you're supposed to do
yXvkZqURv_E,3102090,3108880,[Music]  i say  that it can literally save your life
yXvkZqURv_E,3108880,3115520,i said that it can literally save your  life  we fought everything in life but we do
yXvkZqURv_E,3115520,3120960,nothing about it very few people do  anything about it  what the are you doing about it you
yXvkZqURv_E,3120960,3128480,gotta take action in your life you gotta  got to you got to start being  find a solution to your problem don't be
yXvkZqURv_E,3128480,3134880,the problem take action for every action  is the opposite reaction if all you do  is
yXvkZqURv_E,3134880,3139838,nothing's going to happen in your life  take action take control
yXvkZqURv_E,3142160,3147440,before you can be a painter who can  paint what's beyond near memory
yXvkZqURv_E,3147440,3155599,you you have to inculcate that  discipline skill and a lot of that is  painful repetition and hard grinding
yXvkZqURv_E,3155599,3162480,work it's the sacrifice of the present  for the future but once you manage that  then things open up and virtually
yXvkZqURv_E,3162480,3168640,everything you learn of value is like  that  i need you to focus on why you were born
yXvkZqURv_E,3168640,3174800,in the first place why are you here on  earth for this particular time what are  you doing here
yXvkZqURv_E,3174800,3180880,your dna is in your dream  and most of y'all chasing stuff you  don't realize your dreams are so
yXvkZqURv_E,3180880,3186720,important because your dna who you are  as a person is wrapped up in your dreams  and what this world has done to you is
yXvkZqURv_E,3186720,3195480,take that from you because they know if  you know who you're who you are and you  get your dreams you're probably not  gonna work for most of them
yXvkZqURv_E,3195599,3201130,do i say that your life is worth finding  what it is that you're supposed to do
yXvkZqURv_E,3201130,3206880,[Music]  just start working at it just a little
yXvkZqURv_E,3206880,3213680,bit but do find out what your work is  and hold on to it and don't let your  dream go
yXvkZqURv_E,3214400,3219599,movies are supposed to provoke  emotion they're supposed to make you  feel
yXvkZqURv_E,3219599,3227119,something  i have a better idea  go out into the world and actually
yXvkZqURv_E,3227119,3235760,feel it  go  feel joy and love and triumph and
yXvkZqURv_E,3235760,3243480,rapture and ecstasy and glory go feel  those things
yXvkZqURv_E,3245100,3259820,[Music]
yXvkZqURv_E,3271330,3293130,[Music]
yXvkZqURv_E,3294480,3306619,so  [Music]
yXvkZqURv_E,3308000,3314400,the self is everything you could be  across time so imagine that there's you  and there's the potential inside you
yXvkZqURv_E,3314400,3320640,whatever that is you know and potential  is an interesting idea because it  represents something that isn't yet real
yXvkZqURv_E,3320640,3326480,yet we act like it's real because people  will say to you you should live up to  your potential
yXvkZqURv_E,3326480,3333200,we really can't control anything other  than our own thoughts our own behavior  our own patterns we can't control what
yXvkZqURv_E,3333200,3338480,other people do say or think and it's  this illusion of control often times
yXvkZqURv_E,3338480,3345599,that we can somehow manipulate other  people or manipulate situations that  cause us to fall into these patterns but
yXvkZqURv_E,3345599,3350640,we do have the power of in life is we  have the power to choose
yXvkZqURv_E,3352799,3358880,we often fear that in order to achieve  something new to become someone new we  have to abandon everything that we are
yXvkZqURv_E,3358880,3365599,but in fact that's not how it works  change can happen plank by plank board  by board habit by habit and gradually
yXvkZqURv_E,3365599,3371200,you can become someone new with  consistency and repetition you can  actually change not only your results
yXvkZqURv_E,3371200,3377359,but actually your identity  and the reason that this is true is  because the more evidence that we have
yXvkZqURv_E,3377359,3383839,for a belief the more likely we are to  believe it  mindset is one of the most important
yXvkZqURv_E,3383839,3390240,feeders into your perspective and  perspective is everything  and the first most important decision
yXvkZqURv_E,3390240,3396559,that we all have to make and this is one  of my favorite einstein quotes is each  and every one of us has to decide
yXvkZqURv_E,3396559,3401920,whether we live in a friendly or a  hostile universe
yXvkZqURv_E,3402160,3408720,that potential is partly what you could  be if you interacted with the world in a  manner that would gain you the most
yXvkZqURv_E,3408720,3414558,information  and so you walk through
yXvkZqURv_E,3415040,3419838,you go to all the quarters of the world  to find yourself
yXvkZqURv_E,3420079,3427520,the actions that you take provide  evidence for who you are and it's not  that  habits matter more necessarily on an
yXvkZqURv_E,3427520,3432799,individual basis each moment in life  matters but what ends up happening is  that over the broad span of time things
yXvkZqURv_E,3432799,3438960,that you do once or twice fade away and  things that you do time after time day  after day week after week accumulate the
yXvkZqURv_E,3438960,3442799,bulk of the evidence for what you  believe
yXvkZqURv_E,3445280,3451839,because to me  the very meaning of life  is to see how many skills you can
yXvkZqURv_E,3451839,3457599,acquire that have utility and then put  those skills to use in the service of  something bigger than yourself but the
yXvkZqURv_E,3457599,3463440,only way that you're going to be able to  do that is to build into the core of  your being
yXvkZqURv_E,3463440,3469520,the ability to endure life is hard life  is going to kick you in the face there  are going to be a thousand times in your
yXvkZqURv_E,3469520,3475760,life when you're going to want to give  up and the only thing that is going to  see you through the only thing that's  going to make sure that you actually
yXvkZqURv_E,3475760,3482640,[ __ ] endure is your mindset  all great thinkers have one thing in
yXvkZqURv_E,3482640,3488000,common they spent  long periods of time away from
yXvkZqURv_E,3488000,3494720,diversions distractions  trivial interruptions
yXvkZqURv_E,3498610,3504799,[Music]  the things that we love that are not the  most important are the easiest to
yXvkZqURv_E,3504799,3511520,rationalize spending time on and  distracting us from the things that are  really important right the things that  are good but not great that's the stuff
yXvkZqURv_E,3511520,3517760,that ends up taking us off course  it's not that we don't really want  something it's not that we don't really
yXvkZqURv_E,3517760,3524640,you know want to improve or we don't  know exactly what the most important  thing is to us it's that we choose to  spend our ways on number six through our
yXvkZqURv_E,3524640,3529760,time on number six through 25 too often  but that's the stuff that pulls away  from greatness
yXvkZqURv_E,3529760,3535920,things like and one of the things you do  when you're overwhelmed by crisis  is you shorten your time frame you know
yXvkZqURv_E,3535920,3541200,it's like you can't think about next  month maybe you can't even bloody well  think about next week or maybe not even
yXvkZqURv_E,3541200,3546319,tomorrow  you know because now is just so  overwhelming that that's all there is
yXvkZqURv_E,3546319,3552720,it's like and that's what you do you cut  your time frame back until you can cope  with it and if it's not the next week
yXvkZqURv_E,3552720,3558079,that you see how to get through then  it's the next day and if it's not the  next day then it's the next hour and if
yXvkZqURv_E,3558079,3564640,it's not the next hour then it's the  next minute  and you know people are very very very
yXvkZqURv_E,3564640,3570510,very tough  [Music]
yXvkZqURv_E,3570960,3579599,it turns out that if you face things  that you can put up with a lot more than  you think you can put up with and you  can do it without becoming corrupted
yXvkZqURv_E,3581520,3589440,whatever it is good bad or indifferent  in your life your current level of  happiness of joy of success
yXvkZqURv_E,3589440,3594960,of fulfillment is exactly what you think  you deserve  it's exactly what you think you're worth
yXvkZqURv_E,3594960,3601359,it's a hard thing to accept but in our  lives we are getting out of our life  right now exactly what we believe we're
yXvkZqURv_E,3601359,3608400,worthy of exactly what we think we  deserve our life is a direct reflection  of our identity which is the thoughts
yXvkZqURv_E,3608400,3614160,concepts beliefs values and worth we  hold true to be about ourselves
yXvkZqURv_E,3614160,3619280,turns out most people spend 70 percent  of their life  living in survival and living in stress
yXvkZqURv_E,3619280,3625280,so they're always anticipating  the worst case scenario based on a past
yXvkZqURv_E,3625280,3631280,experience and they're literally  out of the incident potentials in the  quantum field they're selecting the
yXvkZqURv_E,3631280,3636400,worst possible outcome and they're  beginning to emotionally embrace it with  fear and they're conditioning
yXvkZqURv_E,3636400,3641520,their body into a state of fear  what i want you guys to understand
yXvkZqURv_E,3641520,3647720,is one very simple thing  it is a decision
yXvkZqURv_E,3648640,3655010,[Music]
yXvkZqURv_E,3663839,3669119,like the first thing you want to do is  dispense with the idea that you get to  have any
yXvkZqURv_E,3669119,3675040,any permanent security outside of your  ability to contend and adapt  [Music]
yXvkZqURv_E,3675040,3681119,it's like  you're paying a price by sitting there  being miserable you might say well the  devil i know is better than the one i
yXvkZqURv_E,3681119,3688240,don't it's like don't be so sure of that  you have to be really careful whether  you decide that life is difficult it's
yXvkZqURv_E,3688240,3694799,the slew of things that's coming at you  that's trying to break you and nothing  ever good happens to you or if you  choose to believe no matter what happens
yXvkZqURv_E,3694799,3702319,to you you can always choose your  response you can always choose to  believe that it's happening for you and  not to you and in that perspective in
yXvkZqURv_E,3702319,3708400,having that mindset then you're going to  begin to look for the solutions you're  going to look for the ways out you're  going to look for the lesson that you
yXvkZqURv_E,3708400,3713838,can learn in the hardship  that  is mindset
yXvkZqURv_E,3726840,3737899,[Music]
yXvkZqURv_E,3744080,3750799,[Music]  i want to find more
yXvkZqURv_E,3750799,3757440,all i can  you have to dive in that
yXvkZqURv_E,3757440,3762480,to find more  because if you're not willing to go in  there and face yourself
yXvkZqURv_E,3762480,3769640,i can find anything  you can live right here on surface man  right here on surface
yXvkZqURv_E,3769839,3776559,there's nothing quite so tragic  as a young cynic  because it means the person has gone
yXvkZqURv_E,3776559,3786318,from knowing nothing to believing  nothing  [Music]  in my case i was saved in that muteness
yXvkZqURv_E,3786640,3793200,and the sword of that  i was saved  and i was able to draw from human
yXvkZqURv_E,3793200,3798640,thought  [Music]  [Applause]  human disappointments and triumphs
yXvkZqURv_E,3798640,3804079,enough to triumph myself  probability that as you move forward on
yXvkZqURv_E,3804079,3810319,your adventure that you're going to get  it right the first time is zero it's  just not going to happen and so then you
yXvkZqURv_E,3810319,3817200,might think well maybe i'll just wait  around until i get the right idea and  which people do right so they're like 40
yXvkZqURv_E,3817200,3824079,year old 13 year olds which is not a  good idea so they wait around until they  finally got it right waiting around
yXvkZqURv_E,3824079,3831039,isn't going to help because even if it  the perfect opportunity manifested  itself to you in your incomplete form
yXvkZqURv_E,3831039,3837720,the probability that you would recognize  it as the perfect opportunity is zero
yXvkZqURv_E,3838640,3844940,i think the biggest vulnerability you've  got is you actually value somebody's  opinion  more than you value your own
yXvkZqURv_E,3844940,3852038,[Music]  to me the way you win  is you realize you can't hear nobody
yXvkZqURv_E,3853119,3862039,at the end of the day my guy  yourself you gotta get real real quiet  up here i can't hear anything
yXvkZqURv_E,3866340,3870510,[Music]
yXvkZqURv_E,3880319,3887599,the goal isn't to be the best every day  the goal isn't to out to outdo your  competition every day that's a finite
yXvkZqURv_E,3887599,3895520,construction  finite players play to be bet to beat  the people around them infinite players
yXvkZqURv_E,3895520,3901440,play  to be better than themselves  [Music]  fulfillment is what matters
yXvkZqURv_E,3901440,3909720,it is a neurochemistry state  the game you're playing is not success  it is not money it is not legacy it is
yXvkZqURv_E,3909720,3915920,neurochemistry it's feeling good about  yourself right now today in this moment  now
yXvkZqURv_E,3915920,3922960,the absolute foundational building block  to fulfillment is progress now
yXvkZqURv_E,3922960,3928000,i don't mean progress in worldly  pursuits i mean humans are an active
yXvkZqURv_E,3928000,3933039,species that are absolutely designed  to learn
yXvkZqURv_E,3933039,3938799,adapt and grow  now  what it doesn't incentivize is
yXvkZqURv_E,3938799,3943839,the  obsession over where other people are  whether or not we have unique ideas
yXvkZqURv_E,3943839,3952160,whether or not we're valuable none of  that is going to bring you joy okay as  they say comparison is the thief of joy
yXvkZqURv_E,3952400,3958319,if you become successful  don't just stand at the top of the  mountain don't just stand at the top of  the building
yXvkZqURv_E,3958319,3963359,go back down the stairs  and keep building and keep living as
yXvkZqURv_E,3963359,3968480,that person that got you there because  you only got there because you started  from the bottom
yXvkZqURv_E,3968480,3974160,right no one starts at the top and so  you started at the bottom and you built  it up and it was that mindset that you
yXvkZqURv_E,3974160,3979599,started with that got you there and so  for me one of the best ways of dealing  with success is keep expanding the goal
yXvkZqURv_E,3979599,3985039,posts  in your mind  when you push real hard
yXvkZqURv_E,3985039,3991039,you have this door in your mind  and  a lot of us don't want to open that door
yXvkZqURv_E,3991039,3997440,you push open that door  you're in a tunnel  there's a dark ass tunnel
yXvkZqURv_E,3997440,4003680,and you can't get it  there's one thing about being in dark  places
yXvkZqURv_E,4003680,4011359,if you have the courage to stay there  long enough  your eyes will start to adjust to the
yXvkZqURv_E,4011359,4018079,darkness  you are your competition  and that is what ensures you stay in the
yXvkZqURv_E,4018079,4024799,game the longest and that is what  ensures you find joy  because the joy comes
yXvkZqURv_E,4024799,4030520,not from comparison  but from advancement
yXvkZqURv_E,4034160,4040400,change  is inevitable  change is also the principle of life
yXvkZqURv_E,4040400,4047280,that means everything that is alive will  change  to everything  there's a season
yXvkZqURv_E,4047280,4052960,how many things of a season  everything this is one of the best news
yXvkZqURv_E,4052960,4058960,i ever got in my life let me tell you  why  if you having a bad time right now it
yXvkZqURv_E,4058960,4065200,cannot last  there's a place in you
yXvkZqURv_E,4065200,4070720,that you must keep  in violate you must keep it
yXvkZqURv_E,4070720,4078319,pristine clean  so that nobody has the right to curse  you uh treat you badly nobody no mother
yXvkZqURv_E,4078319,4084000,father no wife no husband knows nobody  because that may be the place you go to
yXvkZqURv_E,4084000,4090799,when you meet god  but we won't believe it in this entire  universe most people like only three or
yXvkZqURv_E,4090799,4097920,four things  [Music]  when  you're so constipated in your head
yXvkZqURv_E,4097920,4102960,that you lack only three or four people  or three or four things in your life how
yXvkZqURv_E,4102960,4108000,do you want to open up to the existence  because life is happening because of its
yXvkZqURv_E,4108000,4114719,openness  [Music]  breath is happening so much is happening  in connection with everything it is only
yXvkZqURv_E,4114719,4120600,in openness you're alive  as you close doors you are dying in  installment

yXvkZqURv_E,4254159,4259199,something in football  this is i feel because i
yXvkZqURv_E,4259199,4264719,i was feeling from the beginning that i  was different than the other ones  [Music]
yXvkZqURv_E,4264719,4268719,i was more special i was a special kid
yXvkZqURv_E,4269920,4275199,you have to put in your mind ethic of  work  when you are professional so
yXvkZqURv_E,4275199,4282159,since day one when i start with a  professional let's say with 16 17 18 i'm
yXvkZqURv_E,4282159,4287199,always have ethic to be the best to  train hard to listen to all the players
yXvkZqURv_E,4287199,4292640,experienced players  and of course my dreaming coming true

yXvkZqURv_E,4503550,4506849,[Music]
yXvkZqURv_E,4521199,4526880,when i left my family with 11 years old  to live in a different world which is

yXvkZqURv_E,4532320,4537280,to miss my family but i'm not i'm not  regret
yXvkZqURv_E,4537679,4546400,without sacrifice we cannot win nothing  so i did  unbelievable sacrifice my family too

yXvkZqURv_E,4708400,4712719,how do you overcome the suffering of the  of life
yXvkZqURv_E,4714880,4720480,how do you overcome the suffering of  life is be a better person  that's how you do it
yXvkZqURv_E,4720480,4726480,well that's hard  it takes responsibility and i think you  know if you said to someone you want to
yXvkZqURv_E,4726480,4732159,have a meaningful life  everything you do matters  that's the definition of a meaningful
yXvkZqURv_E,4732159,4738640,life but everything you do matters  you're gonna have to carry that with you
yXvkZqURv_E,4745120,4752480,once you understand the whole reason to  acquire a skill  is that it gives you power
yXvkZqURv_E,4752480,4760239,now i'm gonna define power  power to me  is the ability to close your eyes
yXvkZqURv_E,4760239,4766400,and imagine a world the world the way  you wish it was  and then open your eyes
yXvkZqURv_E,4766400,4773120,and make that world come true  that's power  and the thing that stands between you
yXvkZqURv_E,4773120,4780159,where you are today and your goals where  you want to get  is a gap in skill set it is a gap in
yXvkZqURv_E,4780159,4785679,abilities  one thing i've realized is
yXvkZqURv_E,4785679,4791920,we become victims when we recite our  excuses and we recite them so many times
yXvkZqURv_E,4791920,4797840,we actually believe they are true  and i think you can cling to your  excuses
yXvkZqURv_E,4797840,4802960,or you can go out there and have an  impact and live a fulfilling life and be
yXvkZqURv_E,4802960,4809760,highly creative and and enjoy the magic  life but you don't get to do both
yXvkZqURv_E,4810400,4815440,it's like your growth is the only limit  to your happiness
yXvkZqURv_E,4815440,4821040,if you're not happy you're not growing  in some area and usually it's a place  where you're blaming
yXvkZqURv_E,4821040,4826400,you're pointing the finger i don't care  if it's government don't get me wrong  people can be unfair unjust that's for
yXvkZqURv_E,4826400,4832480,sure happens but you can't control that  you can't make it not happen what you
yXvkZqURv_E,4832480,4838639,have to do is become stronger than any  of it so you're free freedom comes from  growth freedom does not come from
yXvkZqURv_E,4838639,4843840,control because control is an illusion  you can't control everybody no matter  how hard you try can't control what they
yXvkZqURv_E,4843840,4850080,think or feel and not everybody's going  to be fair and just and you my dear  friends and i have not always been fair
yXvkZqURv_E,4850080,4855679,and just whether we admit it or not it's  just the nature of being a being a human  being
yXvkZqURv_E,4855679,4861280,but we can't make the largest pattern  fair and just and loving and powerful  and serving and growing
yXvkZqURv_E,4861280,4867040,until it becomes the dominant thing  inside you and then you experience  life as being great not you're great
yXvkZqURv_E,4867040,4871719,life's great because you're living a  great path
yXvkZqURv_E,4876320,4882320,here's your new definition of passion  passion is simply  energy
yXvkZqURv_E,4882320,4887760,that's all that it is okay  passion  is what you feel
yXvkZqURv_E,4887760,4895039,when you are energized and excited  about what you're doing okay
yXvkZqURv_E,4896000,4902960,i'm going to tell you what your purpose  on earth is right now your purpose on  earth is to figure out how to align your
yXvkZqURv_E,4902960,4908480,life so that you feel more energized and  excited by it that's it
yXvkZqURv_E,4908480,4915679,and it begins with you  following the energy and following your  natural enthusiasm you're not going to
yXvkZqURv_E,4915679,4921600,think your way to passion you can't  think your way to finding something that  you feel in your heart doesn't work that
yXvkZqURv_E,4921600,4929040,way you got to feel your way into it  it's inside of you do you understand  there's no passion out there somewhere
yXvkZqURv_E,4929040,4934400,the passion is in here  every decision we make in our lives as
yXvkZqURv_E,4934400,4939600,individuals or as organizations  is a piece of communication it's our way
yXvkZqURv_E,4939600,4945360,of saying something about who we are and  what we believe  this is why authenticity matters
yXvkZqURv_E,4945360,4952639,this is why you have to say and do the  things you actually believe  because the things you say and do are
yXvkZqURv_E,4952639,4959600,symbols  of who you are  and we look for those symbols so we can  find people who believe what we believe
yXvkZqURv_E,4959600,4965280,our very survival depends on so if  you're putting out false symbols you  will attract people to those symbols but
yXvkZqURv_E,4965280,4970800,you won't be able to form trust with  them  the goal of putting something out there
yXvkZqURv_E,4970800,4977360,if you say what you believe and you do  what you believe you will attract people  who believe what you believe
yXvkZqURv_E,4977360,4983360,[Music]  or do you want to just forget about the
yXvkZqURv_E,4983360,4988719,whole meaning thing  then you don't have any responsibility  because who the hell cares you can
yXvkZqURv_E,4988719,4995760,wander through life doing whatever you  want gratifying impulsive desires for  how useful that's going to be and you're
yXvkZqURv_E,4995760,5002719,stuck in meaninglessness but you don't  have any responsibility which one do you  want  well ask yourself
yXvkZqURv_E,5002719,5009199,which one are you pursuing and you'll  find very rapidly that it isn't the  majority of your soul that's pursuing
yXvkZqURv_E,5009199,5014320,the whole meaning thing because well  look what you have to do to do that you
yXvkZqURv_E,5014320,5021520,have to take on the fact that life is  suffering you have to put yourself  together in the face of that
yXvkZqURv_E,5024719,5030560,whatever that is  wherever you want to go  plant that flag
yXvkZqURv_E,5030560,5037840,identify the skills that you would need  to get there and then set about every  day getting those skills
yXvkZqURv_E,5038400,5043520,well ask yourself which one are you  pursuing and you'll find very rapidly
yXvkZqURv_E,5043520,5048560,that it isn't the majority of your soul  that's pursuing the whole meaning thing
yXvkZqURv_E,5048560,5054639,because well look what you have to do to  do that you have to take on the fact  that life is suffering you have to put
yXvkZqURv_E,5054639,5059760,yourself together  it's old it's the oldest story of
yXvkZqURv_E,5059760,5066800,mankind  [Music]  get yourself together  transcend your suffering see if you can
yXvkZqURv_E,5066800,5071920,be some kind of hero  make the suffering in the world less
yXvkZqURv_E,5071920,5093948,well that's the way forward as far as i  can tell if there is any way forward  [Music]
yXvkZqURv_E,5096260,5100709,[Music]
yXvkZqURv_E,5120560,5126560,[Music]  people's lives aren't what they
yXvkZqURv_E,5126560,5132080,would like them to be  and so then you ask why  well forget about tragedy and
yXvkZqURv_E,5132080,5137520,catastrophe because that's self-evident  but one of the main reasons that people  don't get what they want is because they
yXvkZqURv_E,5137520,5142719,don't actually figure out what it is  and the probability that you're going to
yXvkZqURv_E,5142719,5148560,get what would be good for you let's say  which would even be better than what you  want right because you know you might be
yXvkZqURv_E,5148560,5154800,wrong about what you want easily but  maybe you could get what would really be  good for you
yXvkZqURv_E,5154800,5159920,well why don't you  because you don't try
yXvkZqURv_E,5159920,5166080,the thing that makes individuals really  really special who are that great is
yXvkZqURv_E,5166080,5172800,they're always looking for that  competitive edge  so it's  interesting to see how a champion in
yXvkZqURv_E,5172800,5177840,sports it's the same mindset  it's about winning the battles
yXvkZqURv_E,5177840,5184000,continuing to improve  learning news ways to stay ahead uh stay  ahead of the game
yXvkZqURv_E,5184000,5192000,clarity is what gives you the idea of  success  [Music]
yXvkZqURv_E,5192000,5198400,when you can see  and you can think and you can react with  a clear mind
yXvkZqURv_E,5198400,5204239,he said if you worry about whether the  other people think about you you will  always be their prisoner so
yXvkZqURv_E,5204239,5209600,unless you're prepared to be other  people's prisoners at some point if  they're hurling dirt on you if they're
yXvkZqURv_E,5209600,5215600,constantly trying to re-bury you under  the earth that you're trying to claw  your way out from  then
yXvkZqURv_E,5215600,5221040,you're never going to get out you've got  to just stop worrying about what they  think so they can't actually affect you
yXvkZqURv_E,5221040,5226480,they can only try to influence your  mindset
yXvkZqURv_E,5226480,5232320,you don't think okay  here's what i would like if i could have  it i don't mean
yXvkZqURv_E,5232320,5238639,in a way that you manipulate the world  to force it to deliver you goods for  status or something like that that isn't
yXvkZqURv_E,5238639,5244000,what i mean i mean something like  imagine that you were taking care of  yourself like you were someone you
yXvkZqURv_E,5244000,5249600,actually cared for  and then you thought okay i'm caring for  this person i would like things to go as
yXvkZqURv_E,5249600,5256480,well for them as possible what would  their life have to be like in order for  that to be the case
yXvkZqURv_E,5257840,5262880,no one will believe in you until you  believe in you  and so
yXvkZqURv_E,5262880,5272109,good people often become seduced by the  chatter of their loudest fears  [Music]
yXvkZqURv_E,5272320,5278400,do not let them you've got to understand  who you're trying to become believe in  your ability to get there to become that
yXvkZqURv_E,5278400,5284400,person to understand that to continue to  beat yourself up for something in the  past is not going to serve you and so
yXvkZqURv_E,5284400,5292880,for that very reason let it go  [Music]
yXvkZqURv_E,5292880,5301199,we are good in our comfort zones but the  moment we start to go blue ocean around  our next level of mastery our fears come
yXvkZqURv_E,5301199,5304199,up
yXvkZqURv_E,5316560,5323120,the mind is an instrument don't let it  play you  so it's it's a really powerful thing to
yXvkZqURv_E,5323120,5329120,remember to be just  just remember that you know that that is  that's the job of the mind is to hold on
yXvkZqURv_E,5329120,5335199,to things and to to kind of attach to  things and it's your job to say i choose  this thought and i don't choose that and
yXvkZqURv_E,5335199,5340480,i you know because whatever you give  energy to is what grows
yXvkZqURv_E,5341040,5346080,you know where your energy goes is what  grows and it's like we have to choose
yXvkZqURv_E,5346080,5351120,where we put our energy in because  that's where we're going to manifest so  it's it's
yXvkZqURv_E,5351120,5356880,the more consciously and we can make  those choices and where we're letting  our mind go the better is going to be
yXvkZqURv_E,5356880,5360120,for us
yXvkZqURv_E,5365600,5372239,because we're going out into the unknown  it's human you know if you look to look  at the  psychobiology of it and you were
yXvkZqURv_E,5372239,5379679,studying the pure biology there's a term  called homeostasis human beings are  hardwired for a steady state what
yXvkZqURv_E,5379679,5385760,happens is when we come up with a new  idea and when we see a new opportunity  and we start to leave our comfort zones
yXvkZqURv_E,5385760,5392000,into the zone of the unknown where  greatness lives we get scared
yXvkZqURv_E,5392000,5398800,so i think it starts with realizing your  life is not random you are not here by  accident when you arrive on whatever
yXvkZqURv_E,5398800,5403840,scene it is heaven touches earth your  goodness your life your creativity is
yXvkZqURv_E,5403840,5412219,heaven touching earth and that  perspective changes the way we show up  in the world  [Music]
yXvkZqURv_E,5418320,5423520,no nostalgia for catastrophe  i think that's what that means is that
yXvkZqURv_E,5423520,5429679,when you  leave  what's not good you wash the dust off  your feet
yXvkZqURv_E,5429679,5436719,and you don't look back  and that's a very harsh lesson that  there's no excuses whatsoever for not
yXvkZqURv_E,5436719,5441280,getting up and getting at it that's what  it means
yXvkZqURv_E,5444320,5449920,it even means that  when people are beset with a catastrophe  like that they are prone to use that as
yXvkZqURv_E,5449920,5456239,an excuse  for not going about the business that  they should be going about  because they can say to themselves well
yXvkZqURv_E,5456239,5461840,i would accept  and accept there's always good reasons i  mean believe me there's always good
yXvkZqURv_E,5461840,5468000,reasons for not doing what you should  that's for sure the reasons pile up day  after day to not do what you should
yXvkZqURv_E,5468000,5473280,especially because you're you're aiming  at things in the future you can put them  off indefinitely right because of the
yXvkZqURv_E,5473280,5480159,demands of the  day when you leave somewhere terrible do  not look back there's no nostalgia
yXvkZqURv_E,5480159,5485210,that's that's the letting  the dead parts of yourself go
yXvkZqURv_E,5485210,5490480,[Music]  to experience drastic positive change
yXvkZqURv_E,5490480,5495840,and here's the thing about running away  from your problems
yXvkZqURv_E,5495840,5501760,running away from your past have you  ever noticed that when you run  away
yXvkZqURv_E,5501760,5507280,it tends to follow you  and then if you're going to follow the
yXvkZqURv_E,5507280,5514880,good there's no excuse not to do it and  that and it means no excuse whatsoever  under any circumstances
yXvkZqURv_E,5515360,5521920,there's no  excuse  whatsoever  for not getting at what it is that you
yXvkZqURv_E,5521920,5525320,should be doing
yXvkZqURv_E,5537520,5539600,you
