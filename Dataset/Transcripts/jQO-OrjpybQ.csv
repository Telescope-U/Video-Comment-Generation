jQO-OrjpybQ,550,2914,"You're a baseball fan, I know you're a big sports fan."
jQO-OrjpybQ,2914,4430,Big sports fan in general.
jQO-OrjpybQ,4430,7960,"Okay, well listen. Now we have this issue of"
jQO-OrjpybQ,7960,9080,"whose gonna get into the Hall of Fame, and"
jQO-OrjpybQ,9080,9940,they're not people like...
jQO-OrjpybQ,9940,12639,"Letting people Bonds and Clemens in, because,"
jQO-OrjpybQ,12640,15250,obviously of steroid use in the past.
jQO-OrjpybQ,15250,16730,What's your take on that?
jQO-OrjpybQ,16730,17890,Uh... I don't know.
jQO-OrjpybQ,17890,19767,Does it upset... does it make you crazy?
jQO-OrjpybQ,19767,21970,"No, I don't mind that people use 'roids."
jQO-OrjpybQ,21970,24140,"I think they should use 'roids, because"
jQO-OrjpybQ,24140,25869,"they're using themselves as guinea pigs,"
jQO-OrjpybQ,25870,28020,and it'll all trickle down to us one day.
jQO-OrjpybQ,28020,29170,"And after they messed up, you know,"
jQO-OrjpybQ,29170,30470,"they're heads get all big, and they,"
jQO-OrjpybQ,30470,32430,they take that part out.
jQO-OrjpybQ,32430,33263,I think by the time-
jQO-OrjpybQ,33263,35760,You mean if enough athletes...
jQO-OrjpybQ,35760,37190,"You're saying, use steroids-"
jQO-OrjpybQ,37190,38829,"Destroy themselves with steroids,"
jQO-OrjpybQ,38830,39930,they'll figure out how...
jQO-OrjpybQ,39930,41300,They already... they do it with singers.
jQO-OrjpybQ,41300,43620,"If a singer can't sing, she gets to use a steroid."
jQO-OrjpybQ,43620,44453,Yeah.
jQO-OrjpybQ,44453,45299,Right?
jQO-OrjpybQ,45299,46132,So they're... you say it's going to improve...
jQO-OrjpybQ,46132,48280,It's gonna improve the drug so that we get to use them?
jQO-OrjpybQ,48280,49760,"I'm saying, by the time we're 80,"
jQO-OrjpybQ,49760,52190,they're gonna have like a steroid vaporizer.
jQO-OrjpybQ,52190,54620,"That you can just inhale, and you're gonna have abs."
jQO-OrjpybQ,54620,56300,I'll get a full head of hair.
jQO-OrjpybQ,56300,59290,And you're gonna be banging some hot 65-year-old.
jQO-OrjpybQ,59290,61310,And it's all gonna be because of these athletes
jQO-OrjpybQ,61310,64970,and the sacrifices that they made. That no one appreciates.
jQO-OrjpybQ,64970,65803,"Baseball, I don't know,"
jQO-OrjpybQ,65803,66660,it's not quite the way it used to be.
jQO-OrjpybQ,66660,67530,"I don't like that whole thing,"
jQO-OrjpybQ,67530,70150,"like when you go to a game, if you catch a foul ball"
jQO-OrjpybQ,70150,72010,"you gotta like, give it to a kid now."
jQO-OrjpybQ,72010,73120,What are you talking about?
jQO-OrjpybQ,73120,75670,That's why kids are all mushy and fat.
jQO-OrjpybQ,75670,78600,They don't have to... they don't gotta work for anything!
jQO-OrjpybQ,78600,80189,"First of all I don't like, when I was a kid,"
jQO-OrjpybQ,80190,82960,"I had to fight adults to try and get one,"
jQO-OrjpybQ,82960,85140,"and I never got one, and they blocked me out,"
jQO-OrjpybQ,85140,87940,and that was totally acceptable in the 70's and 80's.
jQO-OrjpybQ,87940,88773,"[Conan] Yes, it's true."
jQO-OrjpybQ,88773,91680,"So now I gotta sit there, take a line shot to my hand,"
jQO-OrjpybQ,91680,93370,"have that swollen up, and then I..."
jQO-OrjpybQ,93370,95600,"Oh, give it to a kid. No!"
jQO-OrjpybQ,95600,98189,Declining ratings. Do you think the NFL has a problem?
jQO-OrjpybQ,98190,99780,They're starting to say they're losing viewership.
jQO-OrjpybQ,99780,103130,No. People who care about football are still watching it.
jQO-OrjpybQ,103130,105780,"They just, they got too big. They just went all poppy."
jQO-OrjpybQ,105780,108290,"They had everybody dressing in pink, right?"
jQO-OrjpybQ,108290,110810,"There's always jets flying over, ""support the troops""."
jQO-OrjpybQ,110810,112790,"Katy Perry's doing a dance, right?"
jQO-OrjpybQ,112790,114620,"They just, they just took it way too far."
jQO-OrjpybQ,114620,116730,What I love about sports is it's a great way to
jQO-OrjpybQ,116730,118630,"tap out from the news, and just you know,"
jQO-OrjpybQ,118630,119829,watch a game and get away from it.
jQO-OrjpybQ,119830,121590,Now there's like all these causes are getting like
jQO-OrjpybQ,121590,124350,"attached to it. Like, I was watching the World Series,"
jQO-OrjpybQ,124350,125869,"and I'm in the middle of watching the World Series,"
jQO-OrjpybQ,125870,127207,"and out of nowhere, they have this moment:"
jQO-OrjpybQ,127207,128929,"""stand up to cancer""."
jQO-OrjpybQ,128929,130299,"I'm watching a ball game, and all of a sudden"
jQO-OrjpybQ,130300,133300,"everybody stands up, holding up a sign"
jQO-OrjpybQ,133300,136000,of somebody that they either know that's dying of cancer
jQO-OrjpybQ,136000,138300,"or died of it, in the middle of the game."
jQO-OrjpybQ,138300,140050,"It's just like, what are you doing?"
jQO-OrjpybQ,141280,143453,Trying to watch a game here! You don't...
jQO-OrjpybQ,143453,145580,"No, there's a time and a place!"
jQO-OrjpybQ,145580,147030,"Look, I know somebody..."
jQO-OrjpybQ,149322,152610,I know somebody that has died of cancer.
jQO-OrjpybQ,152610,154210,"I would never go to the movies with you,"
jQO-OrjpybQ,154210,155737,"and in the middle of it, hit pause and be like"
jQO-OrjpybQ,155737,157813,"""Oh, by the way Conan, I know this guy..."""
jQO-OrjpybQ,157813,159493,(audience laughing)
jQO-OrjpybQ,159493,160840,"""He died of cancer, it was horrific."
jQO-OrjpybQ,160840,163290,"I could have lifted him up off the sheet with two fingers,"
jQO-OrjpybQ,163290,164310,"it was horrible, hey enjoy..."
jQO-OrjpybQ,164310,165911,"Oh, by the way, I got molested when I was nine."
jQO-OrjpybQ,165911,167743,"Enjoy the rest of this."""
jQO-OrjpybQ,167743,168760,You gonna have a Super Bowl party?
jQO-OrjpybQ,168760,171269,Yes. No Super Bowl party. No Super Bowl party.
jQO-OrjpybQ,171270,173127,"If you're a true football fan, you do not go to"
jQO-OrjpybQ,173127,176677,Super Bowl parties. Because it's all a bunch of losers
jQO-OrjpybQ,176677,179930,"who don't watch it all year, and what they do is"
jQO-OrjpybQ,179930,183090,"they talk during the game, and then they shut up"
jQO-OrjpybQ,183090,185450,"during the commercial. And then the game comes back,"
jQO-OrjpybQ,185450,186959,"they're like ""oh, how much you think that one cost?"
jQO-OrjpybQ,186960,188290,Huh? What did you... Was that funny?
jQO-OrjpybQ,188290,189180,"I though that one stunk."""
jQO-OrjpybQ,189180,190890,And it's just like... I just...
jQO-OrjpybQ,190890,192493,The rage that goes through me.
jQO-OrjpybQ,193661,195560,"Through the game. And I just, you know."
jQO-OrjpybQ,195560,197209,"Ended up fighting, you know, with somebody."
jQO-OrjpybQ,197210,199530,So you just are opposed to them having a party
jQO-OrjpybQ,199530,201060,"in the middle of the Super Bowl. Like, you know,"
jQO-OrjpybQ,201060,202030,having a... a half-time show.
jQO-OrjpybQ,202030,203700,"Yeah, I don't like it. It's the most important"
jQO-OrjpybQ,203700,204940,"game of the year, and they turned it into"
jQO-OrjpybQ,204940,206740,like this... this... I don't know what it is.
jQO-OrjpybQ,206740,207840,I don't even know what it is anymore.
jQO-OrjpybQ,207840,210110,It used to be like a little high school band came out...
jQO-OrjpybQ,210110,210943,[Conan] Yeah.
jQO-OrjpybQ,210943,211775,Playing a little song.
jQO-OrjpybQ,211776,212829,[Conan] Right.
jQO-OrjpybQ,212829,213799,And then that was it. And now they just...
jQO-OrjpybQ,213800,215750,Shooting t-shirts into the crowd.
jQO-OrjpybQ,215750,217810,"I really sound like a grumpy old man, but I..."
jQO-OrjpybQ,217810,219280,I just wanna watch the game.
jQO-OrjpybQ,219280,220416,[Conan] Right.
jQO-OrjpybQ,220416,223560,"I'm just gonna be me, sitting alone, screaming at my TV."
jQO-OrjpybQ,223560,225300,How much football do you watch a week?
jQO-OrjpybQ,225300,228370,"I watch... I watch two games on Sunday, I tape three."
jQO-OrjpybQ,228370,229202,[Conan] Right.
jQO-OrjpybQ,229203,230860,"Then I watch the Monday game, and then Tuesday"
jQO-OrjpybQ,230860,232290,I watch one of the three that I taped.
jQO-OrjpybQ,232290,233799,"Wednesday I watch another one, then I watch"
jQO-OrjpybQ,233800,235500,the Thursday night game.
jQO-OrjpybQ,235500,237610,"And then Friday, I watch the Sunday night game."
jQO-OrjpybQ,237610,239310,And then Saturday I watch college football.
jQO-OrjpybQ,239310,240142,Okay.
jQO-OrjpybQ,240143,240976,And it's fine.
jQO-OrjpybQ,240976,241987,Okay.
jQO-OrjpybQ,241987,244000,Because I have a simple male brain
jQO-OrjpybQ,244910,248150,that can just sit there and just... just enjoy it.
jQO-OrjpybQ,248150,250110,I can just enjoy it.
jQO-OrjpybQ,250110,252480,So does your wife watch any of these games with you?
jQO-OrjpybQ,252480,256637,"No, she has the female, complex, multitasking brain."
jQO-OrjpybQ,256637,261637,That's why they can't be happy. They just...
jQO-OrjpybQ,261640,263650,"Always... they're like, what is that lizard"
jQO-OrjpybQ,263650,265759,that can look at two things at once?
jQO-OrjpybQ,265760,267170,That's what they're like.
jQO-OrjpybQ,267170,269180,"So they got the shoes they want, and then"
jQO-OrjpybQ,269180,271285,"they see some other woman walking in, going"
jQO-OrjpybQ,271285,273200,"""oh, look at this skinny bitch over here,"
jQO-OrjpybQ,273200,275630,"she thinks she's cute, right?"" And they..."
jQO-OrjpybQ,275630,276700,That's what I've learned.
jQO-OrjpybQ,276700,277533,Oh god.
jQO-OrjpybQ,277533,278470,You know what makes women happy?
jQO-OrjpybQ,278470,282040,"Nothing. Nothing makes them happy, and that is why"
jQO-OrjpybQ,282040,284530,"they are slowly taking over the NFL, because"
jQO-OrjpybQ,284530,288060,"it annoys that we can just sit there, with like"
jQO-OrjpybQ,288060,290550,"a pizza and a drink, like ""uh, that's not holding!"""
jQO-OrjpybQ,290550,293500,"Just, just be like... and enjoy ourselves."
jQO-OrjpybQ,293500,296210,"So you're saying that you... because you're happy,"
jQO-OrjpybQ,296210,298610,"that you think your wife, and women in general, wanna..."
jQO-OrjpybQ,298610,301870,They're jealous of it. They don't want their own thing.
jQO-OrjpybQ,301870,304603,They don't want their own shit. They want our shit.
jQO-OrjpybQ,305734,307580,I don't know what it is. And it's... I think it's because
jQO-OrjpybQ,307580,309590,"we're happy. We're just sitting there, enjoying ourselves."
jQO-OrjpybQ,309590,312510,Having a good time without them. It drives them nuts.
jQO-OrjpybQ,312510,314270,And they just gotta go in there and ruin it.
jQO-OrjpybQ,314270,316656,I still watch O.J. Simpsons highlights.
jQO-OrjpybQ,316657,318910,(audience laughing)
jQO-OrjpybQ,318910,321423,"I do, I'm a... I'm a football fan."
jQO-OrjpybQ,323170,325510,He's one of the top five running backs of all time.
jQO-OrjpybQ,325510,326740,You're able to compartmentalize.
jQO-OrjpybQ,326740,328423,But he's all of that.
jQO-OrjpybQ,329320,330697,When he goes into a restaurant and they go
jQO-OrjpybQ,330697,334650,"""Murderer! Murderer!"" He's not just that."
jQO-OrjpybQ,334650,338870,"He also won the Heisman Trophy, he ran..."
jQO-OrjpybQ,338870,341720,"He got 2,000 yards in a 14-game season."
jQO-OrjpybQ,341720,344040,"It's just like, people are very... they're complex."
jQO-OrjpybQ,344040,345640,"You think anyone, when he walks into..."
jQO-OrjpybQ,345640,347450,"Complex? You think when he walks into restaurant,"
jQO-OrjpybQ,347450,349150,"anyone yells out ""Heisman Trophy!"""
jQO-OrjpybQ,351240,353360,I would be... I would be adding stuff on.
jQO-OrjpybQ,353360,357580,"You know, ""Naked Gun! Naked Gun! 1 and 2!"""
jQO-OrjpybQ,357580,359259,"I don't like how they interview the coaches too,"
jQO-OrjpybQ,359260,361630,"when they go to the half... like, in half-time."
jQO-OrjpybQ,361630,363150,"As they're running off, like I think they should"
jQO-OrjpybQ,363150,365699,just be able to stay focused on the game.
jQO-OrjpybQ,365700,367050,They shouldn't have to talk to somebody in
jQO-OrjpybQ,367050,369120,"like a ski parka. They're like ""yeah, you know,"
jQO-OrjpybQ,369120,371690,"you're down by 14, what are your thoughts?"""
jQO-OrjpybQ,371690,373770,"It's like, what the... What do you think my thoughts are?"
jQO-OrjpybQ,373770,375960,This sucks! I'm worried about my job.
jQO-OrjpybQ,375960,378210,I'll probably have to sell my house.
jQO-OrjpybQ,378210,380280,My wife's gonna leave me. I need to score
jQO-OrjpybQ,380280,382179,more points in the other half.
jQO-OrjpybQ,382179,383590,(audience laughing)
jQO-OrjpybQ,383590,385210,Who are you? Why am I talking to you?
jQO-OrjpybQ,385210,388259,You're not even in football? Did you even play
jQO-OrjpybQ,388260,389540,to the high school level?
jQO-OrjpybQ,389540,390600,"[Conan] No, no. Probably not."
jQO-OrjpybQ,390600,391650,You took journalism.
jQO-OrjpybQ,391650,392483,[Conan] Yeah.
jQO-OrjpybQ,392483,393316,Get outta here.
jQO-OrjpybQ,393316,395060,What about...
jQO-OrjpybQ,395060,396970,"Yeah, it's a bunch of nerds"
jQO-OrjpybQ,396970,399126,interrupting people who know what they're doing.
jQO-OrjpybQ,399126,401474,(audience laughing)
jQO-OrjpybQ,401474,403560,And the thing that concerned me the most in sports
jQO-OrjpybQ,403560,406120,"was, I watched Cleveland play a home game"
jQO-OrjpybQ,406120,408567,"in November, and it was 71 degrees out."
jQO-OrjpybQ,408567,410349,And the pitchers were sweating and all that...
jQO-OrjpybQ,410350,411994,"No, that's not a good thing, people."
jQO-OrjpybQ,411994,414240,(audience laughing)
jQO-OrjpybQ,414240,416380,This is the golden age of global warming.
jQO-OrjpybQ,416380,418880,So take it in. Stick your arm out the window.
jQO-OrjpybQ,418880,421500,Before the hellfires come.
jQO-OrjpybQ,421500,424810,"Well, always nice to cheer up the crowd."
jQO-OrjpybQ,424810,426750,That's when you know you're in trouble.
jQO-OrjpybQ,426750,428420,"In the NFL, is when you just stand there..."
jQO-OrjpybQ,428420,431647,"I don't even know what that means, ""we gotta get it right."""
jQO-OrjpybQ,431647,433880,"""We didn't get it right, but we're gonna work on"
jQO-OrjpybQ,433880,436930,"trying to get it right, so next time"
jQO-OrjpybQ,436930,438432,"we gotta get it right."""
jQO-OrjpybQ,438433,440377,(audience laughing)
jQO-OrjpybQ,440377,442940,"""I'm embarrassed for my actions."
jQO-OrjpybQ,442940,444663,I'm embarrassed for the League.
jQO-OrjpybQ,446120,449432,Embarrassed for anyone on the same continent as me.
jQO-OrjpybQ,451706,453699,"We didn't get it right, we gotta get it right next time,"
jQO-OrjpybQ,453700,455830,"we're gonna work on getting it right."""
jQO-OrjpybQ,455830,457360,"Starts with that, and then the next day"
jQO-OrjpybQ,457360,458909,the guy's on the sports talk radio.
jQO-OrjpybQ,458910,459743,"You know the ""and, and, and"" guys?"
jQO-OrjpybQ,459743,460600,"[Conan] Yeah, yeah."
jQO-OrjpybQ,460600,462110,That connects all their thoughts with that.
jQO-OrjpybQ,462110,464300,"Like ""they came out in the firs quarter, and..."
jQO-OrjpybQ,464300,466030,"they were all over 'em!"""
jQO-OrjpybQ,466030,468557,"Those guys jump on it. ""What does this say?"
jQO-OrjpybQ,468557,471440,What does... what does the League.. What kind of message...
jQO-OrjpybQ,471440,473090,"what kind of message are they sending out?"""
jQO-OrjpybQ,473090,473930,"Like, I don't... It's like, what..."
jQO-OrjpybQ,473930,476060,What message are they sending out?
jQO-OrjpybQ,476060,477910,"Do you think I'm gonna see this guy hit a woman,"
jQO-OrjpybQ,477910,479349,and then I'm gonna do it?
jQO-OrjpybQ,479349,480400,[Conan] Right.
jQO-OrjpybQ,480400,481233,Right?
jQO-OrjpybQ,481233,482066,Right.

jQO-OrjpybQ,482899,485048,"in the Ravens did it, so I guess it's okay."
jQO-OrjpybQ,485049,487037,(audience laughing)
jQO-OrjpybQ,487037,488470,"""They got a real problem!"""
jQO-OrjpybQ,488470,489787,It drove me nuts the whole month.
jQO-OrjpybQ,489787,491319,"""They got a real problem in the NFL."""
jQO-OrjpybQ,491320,495470,As compared to what? Plumbers? Electricians?
jQO-OrjpybQ,495470,497680,Society in general? There's a lot of great people
jQO-OrjpybQ,497680,501080,that play football. The League's gonna be fine.
jQO-OrjpybQ,501080,503120,A lot of New England fans get upset that
jQO-OrjpybQ,503120,504940,Brady didn't catch that pass.
jQO-OrjpybQ,504940,506281,He should have laid out.
jQO-OrjpybQ,506281,507114,What?
jQO-OrjpybQ,507114,508720,It's the Super Bowl. He should have laid out.
jQO-OrjpybQ,508720,511480,He should have extended his whole body and grabbed it?
jQO-OrjpybQ,511480,513039,"You know what was funny? Was when, on that play"
jQO-OrjpybQ,513039,515240,you actually saw his age? You know?
jQO-OrjpybQ,515240,518010,"If you... when he stands in the pocket, he looks 25."
jQO-OrjpybQ,518010,519460,"The second he starts running, it's like,"
jQO-OrjpybQ,519460,521099,"dude, I could D this guy up."
jQO-OrjpybQ,521099,523259,(audience laughing)
jQO-OrjpybQ,523260,525070,"Like, did you see last year..."
jQO-OrjpybQ,525070,526840,"Last year when he threw that pick-6,"
jQO-OrjpybQ,526840,528790,"when he dove to tackle that guy, it looked"
jQO-OrjpybQ,528790,531841,like somebody threw a dead body out of a car.
jQO-OrjpybQ,531841,534809,"Like, his arm moved, and that was it. But-"
jQO-OrjpybQ,534809,536649,(laughing)
jQO-OrjpybQ,536649,538830,"When he stands in the pocket, he looks like an astronaut."
jQO-OrjpybQ,538830,539663,"Yeah, yeah."
jQO-OrjpybQ,539663,541280,"You're just like, this guy, he's gonna live forever."
jQO-OrjpybQ,541280,542390,"His like, cocoon or something."
jQO-OrjpybQ,542390,543223,Yeah.
jQO-OrjpybQ,543223,544640,"I go to a big college football game, rivalry game,"
jQO-OrjpybQ,544640,546460,every year. This year I went to
jQO-OrjpybQ,546460,549153,University of Miami vs. South Florida State.
jQO-OrjpybQ,549153,551821,"And I had a great time, insane fans. But..."
jQO-OrjpybQ,551821,553540,"You know, I made sure that when I saw Florida State,"
jQO-OrjpybQ,553540,555899,"it was an away game. Because I actually like Florida State,"
jQO-OrjpybQ,555900,558780,but that tomahawk chop thing drives me nuts. And
jQO-OrjpybQ,558780,561100,"it has nothing to even do with the Native American thing,"
jQO-OrjpybQ,561100,564230,"it's the fact that they do it every, like three seconds."
jQO-OrjpybQ,564230,566860,"They form a huddle, and all of a sudden the band"
jQO-OrjpybQ,566860,569860,"starts playing, and everybody in the crowd is like (moaning)"
jQO-OrjpybQ,572310,573980,Like... and they never get sick of it.
jQO-OrjpybQ,573980,576884,"It's like the band knows one song. It's like, I got it."
jQO-OrjpybQ,576884,577940,(audience laughing)
jQO-OrjpybQ,577940,579710,You know what's funny? You know what's funny about that?
jQO-OrjpybQ,579710,582320,"Is, you know like Native Americans never even did that."
jQO-OrjpybQ,582320,584820,"You know, like white people came up with that"
jQO-OrjpybQ,584820,588650,"in like the 1920's, when they were making like..."
jQO-OrjpybQ,588650,590247,"They first got sound in movies, like"
jQO-OrjpybQ,590247,592100,"""what do they sound like?"" ""I don't know."""
jQO-OrjpybQ,592100,593529,"They got some moron on their set,"
jQO-OrjpybQ,593530,596330,all of a sudden just starts going (moaning)
jQO-OrjpybQ,598412,601560,"""Yeah, that sounds good. Put some rouge on his face,"
jQO-OrjpybQ,601560,604377,"and have him do it with an axe. This'll be great."""
jQO-OrjpybQ,605312,606337,"It's like, how do you... I don't know how you..."
jQO-OrjpybQ,606337,607170,"No, no."
jQO-OrjpybQ,607170,609670,"And even if I was the biggest Florida State fan ever,"
jQO-OrjpybQ,609670,611649,"like, even like halfway through the first quarter,"
jQO-OrjpybQ,611650,613480,I'm tapping out. It's like...
jQO-OrjpybQ,613480,615160,Can we get another song going here.
jQO-OrjpybQ,615160,616240,[Conan] Yeah. Something.
jQO-OrjpybQ,616240,617370,"I don't know, I think I made the point."
jQO-OrjpybQ,617370,618362,"Yeah, you made the point."
jQO-OrjpybQ,618362,619510,(audience laughing)
jQO-OrjpybQ,619510,620650,"I was talking to my buddy the other day, like"
jQO-OrjpybQ,620650,623600,what they would have to do to get me to stop watching.
jQO-OrjpybQ,623600,624501,"You know, like-"
jQO-OrjpybQ,624502,625335,[Conan] Because you love football.
jQO-OrjpybQ,625335,627740,"Yeah, the commissioner could literally punt a baby"
jQO-OrjpybQ,627740,632399,across his office with his wingtips on.
jQO-OrjpybQ,632400,634850,I'm still gonna watch on Sunday.
jQO-OrjpybQ,634850,638970,"I don't condone the man's actions, but it's football."
jQO-OrjpybQ,638970,641233,I have to watch it. This is all I have.
