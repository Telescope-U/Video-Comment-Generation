d-BdIo8_wpA,2240,3760,moving to the opposite pocket i
d-BdIo8_wpA,3760,5279,generally have a tool clipped in here
d-BdIo8_wpA,5279,7359,and lately it's reserved for this cutie
d-BdIo8_wpA,7359,11280,the cevivi kiv or kyv blade yeah this
d-BdIo8_wpA,11280,13920,snack size mars bar is an actual blade
d-BdIo8_wpA,13920,16000,any damn fun one to flip open as well
d-BdIo8_wpA,16000,18080,for comparison it's about the size of my
d-BdIo8_wpA,18080,20320,pinky finger when folded up and just as
d-BdIo8_wpA,20320,22240,girthy 2. i'm a huge fan of the flat
d-BdIo8_wpA,22240,24240,slope designs on the g10 scales as it
d-BdIo8_wpA,24240,26800,gives off a sleek futuristic vibe while
d-BdIo8_wpA,26800,28320,giving you something to actually grip
d-BdIo8_wpA,28320,30000,onto and then there's the textured
d-BdIo8_wpA,30000,32078,pointy flipper at the end so you can do
d-BdIo8_wpA,32078,34640,this yeah it is as fun as it looks the
d-BdIo8_wpA,34640,36320,blade itself is one and a half inches
d-BdIo8_wpA,36320,38320,long not the largest but more than
d-BdIo8_wpA,38320,39760,enough to handle all your amazon
d-BdIo8_wpA,39760,42160,packages sure ergonomically it's not the
d-BdIo8_wpA,42160,44239,best but the fact that people will say
d-BdIo8_wpA,44239,46399,oh when you whip this out is worth it
d-BdIo8_wpA,46399,48239,alone instead of scaring everyone around
d-BdIo8_wpA,48239,50000,you otherwise now it is a slip joint
d-BdIo8_wpA,50000,52079,non-locking blade so extra care is
d-BdIo8_wpA,52079,54160,required but it does stay in place when
d-BdIo8_wpA,54160,56239,you need it to and let's be real its
d-BdIo8_wpA,56239,58399,small size is perfect as i'm sure many
d-BdIo8_wpA,58399,60399,of you are experts by now with handling
d-BdIo8_wpA,60399,62719,tiny tools the victorinox swiss card
d-BdIo8_wpA,62719,64000,light not only one of my favorite
d-BdIo8_wpA,64000,66240,multi-tools dare i say this is the best
d-BdIo8_wpA,66240,68240,urban multi-tool you can carry with you
d-BdIo8_wpA,68240,70159,mainly thanks to how slim it is all
d-BdIo8_wpA,70159,72080,while packing a mini knife that's good
d-BdIo8_wpA,72080,74400,enough to open boxes typical office life
d-BdIo8_wpA,74400,76159,stuff a usable pair of scissors for
d-BdIo8_wpA,76159,77840,loose threads or cutting up photos of
d-BdIo8_wpA,77840,79920,your ex an actual flashlight built in
d-BdIo8_wpA,79920,82080,albeit tiny and practically useless but
d-BdIo8_wpA,82080,84400,for tiny cracks this does wonders a not
d-BdIo8_wpA,84400,86320,so ergonomic screwdriver offering four
d-BdIo8_wpA,86320,88320,head sizes but it does do the job for
d-BdIo8_wpA,88320,89920,those damn battery doors on your kids
d-BdIo8_wpA,89920,92880,toys or your toys no judgment here
d-BdIo8_wpA,92880,95040,magnifying glass which is nice to have
d-BdIo8_wpA,95040,96720,but i wouldn't shed a tear if it wasn't
d-BdIo8_wpA,96720,99119,there then in classic victorinox fashion
d-BdIo8_wpA,99119,101200,tweezers for those peeking those hairs a
d-BdIo8_wpA,101200,103119,tiny needle to annoy your co-worker and
d-BdIo8_wpA,103119,105840,an actual pen that's no fisher space but
d-BdIo8_wpA,105840,107759,will do in a jiffy all that combined
d-BdIo8_wpA,107759,110079,into this a credit card size tool that's
d-BdIo8_wpA,110079,112560,even got a ruler because why the heck
d-BdIo8_wpA,112560,114720,not and that's today's theme i showcase
d-BdIo8_wpA,114720,116560,a wallet paired with a credit card sized
d-BdIo8_wpA,116560,119280,piece of edc gear so let's move on
d-BdIo8_wpA,119280,121280,for all the coffee addicts out there so
d-BdIo8_wpA,121280,125200,like 97 of you this is for you because
d-BdIo8_wpA,125200,127119,you know treat yourself from the partner
d-BdIo8_wpA,127119,129520,of this video commentary and they're
d-BdIo8_wpA,129520,131599,well believe it or not barista level
d-BdIo8_wpA,131599,133840,flash frozen coffee basically that
d-BdIo8_wpA,133840,135440,scrumptious six dollar coffee you buy
d-BdIo8_wpA,135440,137280,every morning around the corner now
d-BdIo8_wpA,137280,139360,instantly accessible right in your
d-BdIo8_wpA,139360,141360,freezer and i get it you're skeptical
d-BdIo8_wpA,141360,142720,because anything that goes in the
d-BdIo8_wpA,142720,144480,freezer gets a bad rap but they've
d-BdIo8_wpA,144480,146000,partnered with some of the best regional
d-BdIo8_wpA,146000,147520,specialty coffee roasters brew the
d-BdIo8_wpA,147520,149920,coffee to perfection for you then flash
d-BdIo8_wpA,149920,151680,freeze it locking in all that amazing
d-BdIo8_wpA,151680,154000,flavor and aroma so you can enjoy it
d-BdIo8_wpA,154000,156640,whenever wherever all you gotta do is
d-BdIo8_wpA,156640,158879,add water it's literally impossible to
d-BdIo8_wpA,158879,160879,make a bad cup of joe i've been chugging
d-BdIo8_wpA,160879,162560,these i i mean testing these for the
d-BdIo8_wpA,162560,164800,last few weeks and not only is it a time
d-BdIo8_wpA,164800,166560,saver these are some of the very few
d-BdIo8_wpA,166560,168319,black coffees i've never complained
d-BdIo8_wpA,168319,170319,about tasting too bitter or sour
d-BdIo8_wpA,170319,172480,seriously i just heat up the kettle peel
d-BdIo8_wpA,172480,175519,one back pop it in and well bam anyone
d-BdIo8_wpA,175519,177599,that requires coffee to properly wake up
d-BdIo8_wpA,177599,179280,can relate to the struggle of waiting
d-BdIo8_wpA,179280,181360,for every drip while half awake every
d-BdIo8_wpA,181360,183440,morning now you get the convenience of
d-BdIo8_wpA,183440,185920,instant coffee but like the quality of a
d-BdIo8_wpA,185920,187840,fresh cup from your favorite coffee shop
d-BdIo8_wpA,187840,189519,the best part though you're not only
d-BdIo8_wpA,189519,191519,limited to a hot cup pick your flavor of
d-BdIo8_wpA,191519,193360,choice toss it in some hot water for a
d-BdIo8_wpA,193360,195280,minute until it's all melted inside pop
d-BdIo8_wpA,195280,197599,in some ice pour water or milk in and
d-BdIo8_wpA,197599,200879,alakazam yes i 100 felt like a real
d-BdIo8_wpA,200879,205040,barista for a second uh until i did this
d-BdIo8_wpA,205040,206720,i've never made my own iced coffee
d-BdIo8_wpA,206720,208080,before so
d-BdIo8_wpA,208080,211480,bottoms up
d-BdIo8_wpA,212159,216080,wow that is smooth
d-BdIo8_wpA,220400,222720,cheers better yet when you're done since
d-BdIo8_wpA,222720,224640,there aren't any coffee grinds left over
d-BdIo8_wpA,224640,227920,this is the world's first 100 curbside
d-BdIo8_wpA,227920,230640,recyclable aluminum capsules come on who
d-BdIo8_wpA,230640,232239,knew you could feel so good about
d-BdIo8_wpA,232239,234000,drinking coffee so for a limited time
d-BdIo8_wpA,234000,236480,save 20 off your first purchase and you
d-BdIo8_wpA,236480,238640,can give the gift of amazing coffee
d-BdIo8_wpA,238640,240799,right in their freezer when when the
d-BdIo8_wpA,240799,242720,cable card this fairly thick credit card
d-BdIo8_wpA,242720,244799,size cable system that may replace any
d-BdIo8_wpA,244799,246560,cable you carry on the go made of
d-BdIo8_wpA,246560,248640,plastic all around everything is compact
d-BdIo8_wpA,248640,250480,though with no loose parts flip-flopping
d-BdIo8_wpA,250480,252239,around but inside this simple looking
d-BdIo8_wpA,252239,254560,package stores every plug and adapter
d-BdIo8_wpA,254560,256799,for all your file transfer charging and
d-BdIo8_wpA,256799,258479,mobile needs which are all based around
d-BdIo8_wpA,258479,261120,this main usb c to usb c cable wrapped
d-BdIo8_wpA,261120,262479,on the inside with the included
d-BdIo8_wpA,262479,265360,lightning micro usb and usb-a adapters
d-BdIo8_wpA,265360,267360,this cable can become any cable you need
d-BdIo8_wpA,267360,269280,it to be without the hassle of extra
d-BdIo8_wpA,269280,271600,wires not only that plunking one end
d-BdIo8_wpA,271600,273440,into the unit itself and the other into
d-BdIo8_wpA,273440,276160,a power source it powers a built-in led
d-BdIo8_wpA,276160,278960,light which is well neat but even more
d-BdIo8_wpA,278960,280960,impressive the whole thing optimus prime
d-BdIo8_wpA,280960,283040,transforms into a wireless charging
d-BdIo8_wpA,283040,285120,stand yeah even with this dbrand grip
d-BdIo8_wpA,285120,286479,case on with their updated super
d-BdIo8_wpA,286479,288000,satisfying clicky buttons they can
d-BdIo8_wpA,288000,289520,charge right through the case while you
d-BdIo8_wpA,289520,291440,binge some babish or better yet while
d-BdIo8_wpA,291440,293680,traveling you can always have a bedside
d-BdIo8_wpA,293680,295280,wireless charger handy when you're done
d-BdIo8_wpA,295280,297199,everything folds into a specific spot
d-BdIo8_wpA,297199,299280,inside the cable card with every tool
d-BdIo8_wpA,299280,301680,ready to go on the go
d-BdIo8_wpA,301680,303280,hiding in one of the side expansion mesh
d-BdIo8_wpA,303280,305520,pockets is my matador pocket blanket
d-BdIo8_wpA,305520,307520,probably my all-time favorite piece of
d-BdIo8_wpA,307520,309919,non-tech that i've shown off so many
d-BdIo8_wpA,309919,312240,times because it's packed up like this
d-BdIo8_wpA,312240,314639,but transforms into this large enough
d-BdIo8_wpA,314639,317520,for one medium-sized asian man or twins
d-BdIo8_wpA,317520,319840,sitting side by side who potentially
d-BdIo8_wpA,319840,321280,hate each other's guts now the whole
d-BdIo8_wpA,321280,323120,blanket isn't padded nor will it feel
d-BdIo8_wpA,323120,325120,like sitting on a cloud or anything but
d-BdIo8_wpA,325120,327199,it's waterproof making it easy to clean
d-BdIo8_wpA,327199,329360,off any dirt or liquids which is the
d-BdIo8_wpA,329360,331280,exact reason i love it because none of
d-BdIo8_wpA,331280,333680,that grimy stuff gets on my own body the
d-BdIo8_wpA,333680,335199,whole blanket is pretty lightweight
d-BdIo8_wpA,335199,337120,though so they do include metal stakes
d-BdIo8_wpA,337120,339199,that keep it grounded in sand or grass
d-BdIo8_wpA,339199,341680,but the best part is it also doubles as
d-BdIo8_wpA,341680,344000,a portable poncho not that other ponchos
d-BdIo8_wpA,344000,345840,aren't portable which alone is worth it
d-BdIo8_wpA,345840,347680,so you don't have to deal with carrying
d-BdIo8_wpA,347680,349440,an umbrella around however when you're
d-BdIo8_wpA,349440,351039,done acting like a fool though these
d-BdIo8_wpA,351039,352960,stitch lines are actually a built-in
d-BdIo8_wpA,352960,355199,tutorial on how to fold it back neatly
d-BdIo8_wpA,355199,357600,so it packs back into this literally
d-BdIo8_wpA,357600,359280,fitting into the palm of your hand
d-BdIo8_wpA,359280,361199,moving along the next one is my favorite
d-BdIo8_wpA,361199,363759,piece of edc the slice edc folding knife
d-BdIo8_wpA,363759,365840,this tiny cutie is exactly what i've
d-BdIo8_wpA,365840,367919,wanted for a pocket blade first off it
d-BdIo8_wpA,367919,369919,uses a ceramic blade while not as sharp
d-BdIo8_wpA,369919,372240,as a metal one it's much much safer
d-BdIo8_wpA,372240,373759,while it's still possible to do some
d-BdIo8_wpA,373759,376000,damage to yourself it's highly unlikely
d-BdIo8_wpA,376000,377840,unless you're really trying to but as a
d-BdIo8_wpA,377840,380160,tool it does exactly what i needed to do
d-BdIo8_wpA,380160,382560,cut boxes and it does it really well too
d-BdIo8_wpA,382560,383919,i've also learned that the beauty of
d-BdIo8_wpA,383919,385759,ceramic is that it doesn't dull as
d-BdIo8_wpA,385759,387280,easily either now i've got the curved
d-BdIo8_wpA,387280,389120,point blade on this making it doubly
d-BdIo8_wpA,389120,391120,safe but slice does offer a pointed
d-BdIo8_wpA,391120,392960,version for some more serious cutting i
d-BdIo8_wpA,392960,394479,will say the rounded point struggles
d-BdIo8_wpA,394479,396400,with more flexible and dense material
d-BdIo8_wpA,396400,397919,such as rope although with enough
d-BdIo8_wpA,397919,400080,willpower anything is possible but if
d-BdIo8_wpA,400080,401919,you're like me and only carry a blade
d-BdIo8_wpA,401919,404000,for the 37 packages you receive on the
d-BdIo8_wpA,404000,406080,daily it does the job perfectly for
d-BdIo8_wpA,406080,407919,cardboard and tape on top of that the
d-BdIo8_wpA,407919,410319,tiny size is a huge bonus for me as it
d-BdIo8_wpA,410319,411919,doesn't weigh down my pockets and
d-BdIo8_wpA,411919,413440,although a cute little fellow the
d-BdIo8_wpA,413440,415440,metallic and weighted body in the hand
d-BdIo8_wpA,415440,417599,makes it feel like an actual industrial
d-BdIo8_wpA,417599,419520,tool while the smooth edges means it's
d-BdIo8_wpA,419520,421440,also not going to dig into you either
d-BdIo8_wpA,421440,423440,you sort of just don't want to let it go
d-BdIo8_wpA,423440,425360,add on top of that how addicting this is
d-BdIo8_wpA,425360,427680,that final click is worth it alone but
d-BdIo8_wpA,427680,430240,as a edc box cutter this is the cutest
d-BdIo8_wpA,430240,432560,safest and most fidgety blade that i
d-BdIo8_wpA,432560,434960,think i'm addicted to now this one i can
d-BdIo8_wpA,434960,437599,easily crown as the best tech accessory
d-BdIo8_wpA,437599,439759,or anything really organizer the
d-BdIo8_wpA,439759,441360,side-by-side pouch looks like your
d-BdIo8_wpA,441360,443440,standard pill-shaped storage case but
d-BdIo8_wpA,443440,445199,it's got this thick yet stretchy
d-BdIo8_wpA,445199,447199,material as a secret weapon whether it
d-BdIo8_wpA,447199,448960,be your macbook accessories nintendo
d-BdIo8_wpA,448960,450560,switch controllers or camera lens
d-BdIo8_wpA,450560,452800,filters this flexible pocket design can
d-BdIo8_wpA,452800,455199,gobble up whatever you throw at it yeah
d-BdIo8_wpA,455199,457759,even a full-size round and obscure
d-BdIo8_wpA,457759,460240,shaped mouse no problem the pocket just
d-BdIo8_wpA,460240,462160,swallows it and becomes one with it
d-BdIo8_wpA,462160,463680,leaving plenty of space for other gear
d-BdIo8_wpA,463680,465599,too as the whole pocket expands and
d-BdIo8_wpA,465599,467520,conforms to the shape of every item
d-BdIo8_wpA,467520,469120,inside combine that with the large
d-BdIo8_wpA,469120,471360,trusty zipper your gear ain't going
d-BdIo8_wpA,471360,473360,anywhere however the feast doesn't end
d-BdIo8_wpA,473360,476080,there open up the other side and wha bam
d-BdIo8_wpA,476080,477919,you ain't never seen organization like
d-BdIo8_wpA,477919,480560,this before a slot pocket and zipper for
d-BdIo8_wpA,480560,482960,every piece of gear essentials chargers
d-BdIo8_wpA,482960,484800,controllers and more stretchy goodness
d-BdIo8_wpA,484800,486879,to fit all the weird and exotic cables
d-BdIo8_wpA,486879,488639,you own and when all packed away i
d-BdIo8_wpA,488639,489919,wouldn't blame you if you thought that
d-BdIo8_wpA,489919,492240,you over packed but don't worry it all
d-BdIo8_wpA,492240,494160,comfortably crams inside with nothing
d-BdIo8_wpA,494160,496000,sliding around and plenty of padding to
d-BdIo8_wpA,496000,497840,ensure nothing is damaged either plus
d-BdIo8_wpA,497840,499840,since each item has its own slot jumping
d-BdIo8_wpA,499840,501919,into any pocket means you know exactly
d-BdIo8_wpA,501919,503759,where each accessory is as the full
d-BdIo8_wpA,503759,505759,zipper design allows for complete access
d-BdIo8_wpA,505759,507440,while the quick access pocket keeps your
d-BdIo8_wpA,507440,509440,gear from overflowing but offers just
d-BdIo8_wpA,509440,511120,enough to sneak something in and out
d-BdIo8_wpA,511120,513279,before anyone notices the best part is
d-BdIo8_wpA,513279,515360,the pouch only gets as big as the gear
d-BdIo8_wpA,515360,517440,you carry inside it so there's no wasted
d-BdIo8_wpA,517440,519599,space and in theory you might finally
d-BdIo8_wpA,519599,521120,not have to stress about whether you
d-BdIo8_wpA,521120,523120,packed enough charges for any mobile
d-BdIo8_wpA,523120,525040,gamers out there specifically shooters
d-BdIo8_wpA,525040,527360,like pubg and cod mobile this is the
d-BdIo8_wpA,527360,529279,best game trigger i've ever tested the
d-BdIo8_wpA,529279,531200,fly dg shadow stinger with a durable
d-BdIo8_wpA,531200,533040,build that can handle any rage quitting
d-BdIo8_wpA,533040,534480,rubber padding throughout the interior
d-BdIo8_wpA,534480,536560,to keep your phone scratch free and this
d-BdIo8_wpA,536560,538160,the single trigger around back that's
d-BdIo8_wpA,538160,540160,actually molded ergonomically to each
d-BdIo8_wpA,540160,542000,dedicated side and it's actually pretty
d-BdIo8_wpA,542000,543600,surprising what a difference it makes in
d-BdIo8_wpA,543600,545200,comfort so setting it up the first
d-BdIo8_wpA,545200,547200,benefit is their adjustable clamp on top
d-BdIo8_wpA,547200,548640,as it won't push up against any screen
d-BdIo8_wpA,548640,550160,protectors you already have installed
d-BdIo8_wpA,550160,552160,once clipped in place you use and hold
d-BdIo8_wpA,552160,554000,your phone as you normally would except
d-BdIo8_wpA,554000,555920,now you have two additional fingers in
d-BdIo8_wpA,555920,557440,play and for anyone who plays these
d-BdIo8_wpA,557440,559440,games we'll understand how crucial that
d-BdIo8_wpA,559440,561120,is for reaction times but it doesn't
d-BdIo8_wpA,561120,562959,even end there the second benefit is
d-BdIo8_wpA,562959,564720,that they're modular as you can add on
d-BdIo8_wpA,564720,566640,their additional shoulder buttons using
d-BdIo8_wpA,566640,568320,the same clamping system they plug
d-BdIo8_wpA,568320,570160,directly into the original triggers and
d-BdIo8_wpA,570160,572160,even offer a beefier grip to hold on to
d-BdIo8_wpA,572160,573839,but more importantly that's an
d-BdIo8_wpA,573839,575920,additional two fingers in play with six
d-BdIo8_wpA,575920,578399,buttons instantly accessible at any time
d-BdIo8_wpA,578399,580640,i call it a competitive advantage while
d-BdIo8_wpA,580640,582640,others may borderline call it cheating
d-BdIo8_wpA,582640,584160,but that's just because they don't have
d-BdIo8_wpA,584160,586160,one themselves lastly if managing six
d-BdIo8_wpA,586160,587680,fingers at once is too much for your
d-BdIo8_wpA,587680,589760,brain you can remove as you please
d-BdIo8_wpA,589760,591760,allowing you to build your own ultimate
d-BdIo8_wpA,591760,593839,setup the triggers are very light with a
d-BdIo8_wpA,593839,595600,full charge that lasts hours on end
d-BdIo8_wpA,595600,597360,making them a no-brainer to have it in
d-BdIo8_wpA,597360,599279,your bag at all times as i've never
d-BdIo8_wpA,599279,600959,worried about them braking on me either
d-BdIo8_wpA,600959,602720,they also become an addictive fidget
d-BdIo8_wpA,602720,604560,clicker that may or may not annoy
d-BdIo8_wpA,604560,606320,everyone around you now sharing that
d-BdIo8_wpA,606320,609120,large space is this my personal cutlery
d-BdIo8_wpA,609120,611279,from outlury yes restaurants will
d-BdIo8_wpA,611279,612800,generally provide them but i've
d-BdIo8_wpA,612800,614480,forgotten a fork and spoon getting
d-BdIo8_wpA,614480,616880,takeout one too many times hence having
d-BdIo8_wpA,616880,618399,this set with me would save me from
d-BdIo8_wpA,618399,620480,having to hunt one down after the fact
d-BdIo8_wpA,620480,622079,made of stainless steel not only will
d-BdIo8_wpA,622079,623760,these feel like an actual set of
d-BdIo8_wpA,623760,625519,silverware it also makes them really
d-BdIo8_wpA,625519,627680,easy to clean a little setup is involved
d-BdIo8_wpA,627680,629680,but it won't require ikea instructions
d-BdIo8_wpA,629680,631680,to do and when fully assembled at about
d-BdIo8_wpA,631680,633760,8 inches long you can do some serious
d-BdIo8_wpA,633760,635839,damage to that kung pao chicken speaking
d-BdIo8_wpA,635839,637839,of which my favorite set definitely goes
d-BdIo8_wpA,637839,639680,to the chopstick attachments as my
d-BdIo8_wpA,639680,641200,girlfriend would say the ultimate
d-BdIo8_wpA,641200,643360,utensil and yeah with the added grip on
d-BdIo8_wpA,643360,645600,the tip they almost work a little too
d-BdIo8_wpA,645600,647279,well thanks to its simple design though
d-BdIo8_wpA,647279,648959,everything is easily cleaned with some
d-BdIo8_wpA,648959,650959,water and a napkin then packs away
d-BdIo8_wpA,650959,652959,neatly inside the silicone shell so it
d-BdIo8_wpA,652959,654240,doesn't sound like you're playing the
d-BdIo8_wpA,654240,656079,tambourine every time you take a step
d-BdIo8_wpA,656079,657680,now if you want to go full accessorize
d-BdIo8_wpA,657680,659600,though you can get the silicone case to
d-BdIo8_wpA,659600,660399,protect
d-BdIo8_wpA,660399,663120,your other case because at this point
d-BdIo8_wpA,663120,665040,you shouldn't expect anything less on
d-BdIo8_wpA,665040,666079,this channel
d-BdIo8_wpA,666079,668640,like an actual water bottle yes the memo
d-BdIo8_wpA,668640,671440,bottle in the a7 size look no one should
d-BdIo8_wpA,671440,673440,ever question whether they need a tiny
d-BdIo8_wpA,673440,675440,bottle in their life they just do made
d-BdIo8_wpA,675440,677920,of a bpa-free triton plastic it's quite
d-BdIo8_wpA,677920,679920,sturdy holding the rectangular shape of
d-BdIo8_wpA,679920,681680,the whole bottle it's meant to represent
d-BdIo8_wpA,681680,684079,the shape of an actual a7 notebook i am
d-BdIo8_wpA,684079,685839,thankful they gave it flat edges as well
d-BdIo8_wpA,685839,687760,so it can stand on its own and i've got
d-BdIo8_wpA,687760,689519,their aluminum matte black lid sold
d-BdIo8_wpA,689519,691279,separately of course but it does include
d-BdIo8_wpA,691279,693760,a plastic black and white lid in the box
d-BdIo8_wpA,693760,695600,there's not much else to say other than
d-BdIo8_wpA,695600,697519,let's fill this bad boy up since it only
d-BdIo8_wpA,697519,699440,holds about six ounces which is about
d-BdIo8_wpA,699440,701519,180 milliliters for the rest of the
d-BdIo8_wpA,701519,704399,world this apple juice box at 200 ml is
d-BdIo8_wpA,704399,706160,the closest i could find and it did use
d-BdIo8_wpA,706160,708240,up just about most of the carton minus
d-BdIo8_wpA,708240,710720,the spillage so it is as small as
d-BdIo8_wpA,710720,712480,advertised when compared to a regular
d-BdIo8_wpA,712480,714880,500 ml water bottle it definitely wins
d-BdIo8_wpA,714880,717360,in size and it's much fancier to look at
d-BdIo8_wpA,717360,719440,minus the child's drinking side and the
d-BdIo8_wpA,719440,721760,best part it fits inside my front pocket
d-BdIo8_wpA,721760,723519,fairly comfortable too where it doesn't
d-BdIo8_wpA,723519,725680,bulge out and get mistaken for something
d-BdIo8_wpA,725680,728720,else of course 180 milliliters isn't a
d-BdIo8_wpA,728720,730959,large amount it's about three gulps if
d-BdIo8_wpA,730959,732800,we're counting scientifically but again
d-BdIo8_wpA,732800,734720,when it comes to tiny things it doesn't
d-BdIo8_wpA,734720,739160,hurt to carry just in case
