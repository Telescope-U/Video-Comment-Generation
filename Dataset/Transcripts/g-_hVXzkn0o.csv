g-_hVXzkn0o,1439,4240,it is may 9th 2022 and you're watching
g-_hVXzkn0o,4240,6160,the code report for the last 10 years
g-_hVXzkn0o,6160,7759,people have been saying there's a bubble
g-_hVXzkn0o,7759,9519,intact and finally it looks like that
g-_hVXzkn0o,9519,11599,bubble is starting to pop or maybe it's
g-_hVXzkn0o,11599,14080,just a minor correction this is fine
g-_hVXzkn0o,14080,15519,i'm okay with the events that are
g-_hVXzkn0o,15519,17840,unfolding currently nobody really knows
g-_hVXzkn0o,17840,19199,let's take a look at some of the bad
g-_hVXzkn0o,19199,20560,news that has been piling up over the
g-_hVXzkn0o,20560,22080,last few months and find out what it
g-_hVXzkn0o,22080,24160,means for developers tech workers and
g-_hVXzkn0o,24160,26160,startup founders in a video about a year
g-_hVXzkn0o,26160,27840,ago i pointed out how companies like
g-_hVXzkn0o,27840,29920,snowflake and shopify were absurdly
g-_hVXzkn0o,29920,32320,overvalued as of today shopify is down
g-_hVXzkn0o,32320,34399,over 75 percent and they're not the only
g-_hVXzkn0o,34399,36000,one virtually every high-flying tech
g-_hVXzkn0o,36000,37760,stock that ipo'd over the last five
g-_hVXzkn0o,37760,40160,years is down anywhere from 50 to 90
g-_hVXzkn0o,40160,41680,percent the common theme around these
g-_hVXzkn0o,41680,43120,companies is that they don't actually
g-_hVXzkn0o,43120,44559,make any money they may have a lot of
g-_hVXzkn0o,44559,46399,revenue growth but don't actually turn a
g-_hVXzkn0o,46399,48000,profit and that means they need money to
g-_hVXzkn0o,48000,49840,burn through to survive unfortunately
g-_hVXzkn0o,49840,51840,the transitory inflation wasn't actually
g-_hVXzkn0o,51840,53600,transitory and now the federal reserve
g-_hVXzkn0o,53600,55360,has had to turn the easy money spigot
g-_hVXzkn0o,55360,56879,off in addition many of these companies
g-_hVXzkn0o,56879,58480,exploded during the pandemic and now
g-_hVXzkn0o,58480,59680,growth is hitting a wall because
g-_hVXzkn0o,59680,62399,pandemic mode has been turned off
g-_hVXzkn0o,62399,63840,now if you're a bag holder for one of
g-_hVXzkn0o,63840,65518,these companies that sucks but the thing
g-_hVXzkn0o,65518,66960,that's a little more worrisome is that
g-_hVXzkn0o,66960,68640,when companies lose money this rapidly
g-_hVXzkn0o,68640,70240,they need to start cutting expenses and
g-_hVXzkn0o,70240,72000,one of the best ways to do that is via
g-_hVXzkn0o,72000,74400,layoffs screw you
g-_hVXzkn0o,74400,76880,you're fired last week we saw
g-_hVXzkn0o,76880,78799,high-profile companies like robin hood
g-_hVXzkn0o,78799,80880,and work rise implement layoffs and meta
g-_hVXzkn0o,80880,83439,aka facebook implemented a hiring freeze
g-_hVXzkn0o,83439,84880,that's not a good sign for a company
g-_hVXzkn0o,84880,86000,that wants to put us all on the
g-_hVXzkn0o,86000,87439,metaverse now the big picture as of
g-_hVXzkn0o,87439,89040,today still looks very strong but the
g-_hVXzkn0o,89040,91040,dynamic seems to be rapidly changing it
g-_hVXzkn0o,91040,92640,could stop right here but it could also
g-_hVXzkn0o,92640,94079,get a lot worse and i think we should
g-_hVXzkn0o,94079,95840,all be aware of that possibility now you
g-_hVXzkn0o,95840,97280,might think the answer to this is
g-_hVXzkn0o,97280,99520,bitcoin and crypto bitcoin has also
g-_hVXzkn0o,99520,101680,crashed 50 in the last six months and
g-_hVXzkn0o,101680,103520,like i predicted in my web 3 video this
g-_hVXzkn0o,103520,105040,decline has gone hand in hand with a
g-_hVXzkn0o,105040,107600,decline in hype for web 3 and nfts these
g-_hVXzkn0o,107600,108880,may be amazing revolutionary
g-_hVXzkn0o,108880,110479,technologies long term but it's a lot
g-_hVXzkn0o,110479,111920,harder to have fun when everybody's
g-_hVXzkn0o,111920,113600,losing money now another group of people
g-_hVXzkn0o,113600,115439,affected are the startup founders
g-_hVXzkn0o,115439,117119,especially those who depend on venture
g-_hVXzkn0o,117119,118640,capital many people have called out the
g-_hVXzkn0o,118640,120960,whole vc system as a giant ponzi scheme
g-_hVXzkn0o,120960,122880,made possible by easy money investor
g-_hVXzkn0o,122880,124640,sentiment is way down valuations are
g-_hVXzkn0o,124640,126399,going down and less capital is being
g-_hVXzkn0o,126399,127920,deployed in all likelihood this means
g-_hVXzkn0o,127920,129200,you'll have a harder time securing
g-_hVXzkn0o,129200,130800,funding in the near future and companies
g-_hVXzkn0o,130800,131840,that have already been funded will
g-_hVXzkn0o,131840,133760,likely need to cut costs and increase
g-_hVXzkn0o,133760,134959,growth if they want to see additional
g-_hVXzkn0o,134959,136480,funding in the future and zombie
g-_hVXzkn0o,136480,137599,companies that have no path to
g-_hVXzkn0o,137599,139520,profitability will probably not survive
g-_hVXzkn0o,139520,141200,very much longer the days of companies
g-_hVXzkn0o,141200,144000,like fast which had 60 million or no 60
g-_hVXzkn0o,144000,145440,thousand dollars in annual recurring
g-_hVXzkn0o,145440,148319,revenue and 500 employees are over fast
g-_hVXzkn0o,148319,150000,didn't become profitable fast enough and
g-_hVXzkn0o,150000,152160,was discontinued in april the last time
g-_hVXzkn0o,152160,154319,things looked this bad was early 2020
g-_hVXzkn0o,154319,155920,but that time the central banks were
g-_hVXzkn0o,155920,157760,able to print trillions upon trillions
g-_hVXzkn0o,157760,159680,of dollars the rich got way richer and
g-_hVXzkn0o,159680,161360,we got the leftover crumbs in the form
g-_hVXzkn0o,161360,162959,of stimis which we're now paying for
g-_hVXzkn0o,162959,164879,many times over in the form of inflation
g-_hVXzkn0o,164879,166400,now i realize this video sounds very
g-_hVXzkn0o,166400,168239,pessimistic but just remember that
g-_hVXzkn0o,168239,170000,things could always get a lot worse like
g-_hVXzkn0o,170000,171440,they could start world war three at any
g-_hVXzkn0o,171440,173040,moment and draft us all onto the front
g-_hVXzkn0o,173040,174720,lines until that happens though i will
g-_hVXzkn0o,174720,176319,continue to learn to code and try to
g-_hVXzkn0o,176319,177920,create value for other people because
g-_hVXzkn0o,177920,179760,often the best opportunities emerge out
g-_hVXzkn0o,179760,181360,of downturns like this this has been the
g-_hVXzkn0o,181360,183280,code report thanks for watching and i
g-_hVXzkn0o,183280,187319,will see you in the next one
