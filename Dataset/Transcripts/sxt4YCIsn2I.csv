sxt4YCIsn2I,1831,3041,I wanted to be in New York
sxt4YCIsn2I,3041,5333,"because when I got the lottery green card visa,"
sxt4YCIsn2I,5543,8463,"out of 50 states, I can go to any state I want to,"
sxt4YCIsn2I,8463,9505,but I chose New York.
sxt4YCIsn2I,9505,10506,Why?
sxt4YCIsn2I,10506,12341,Because it is the capital of the world.
sxt4YCIsn2I,13760,15511,"Special Pondicherry, very spicy."
sxt4YCIsn2I,15511,16971,"Any water, soda, ginger beer?"
sxt4YCIsn2I,17847,20433,This is the first vegan dosa cart in the world.
sxt4YCIsn2I,21350,23311,"We keep you healthy, I’m wealthy."
sxt4YCIsn2I,23311,25104,[Street Food Icons]
sxt4YCIsn2I,25104,26981,[NY Dosas]
sxt4YCIsn2I,28441,32445,New York is known to be hot dog and shish kebab and stuff.
sxt4YCIsn2I,32445,34739,No one expects from a tiny cart like this
sxt4YCIsn2I,34739,36740,"that we are providing good, healthy food."
sxt4YCIsn2I,36991,39202,"My name is Kandaswamy Thirukumar,"
sxt4YCIsn2I,39202,42204,"and the people call me “Thiru, the dosa man.”"
sxt4YCIsn2I,42747,47835,"I operate NY Dosas vegetarian, vegan dosa cart in Washington Square Park."
sxt4YCIsn2I,47835,49836,"This one, I’m doing the past 17 years."
sxt4YCIsn2I,49837,51964,This is my 18th year going now.
sxt4YCIsn2I,52256,54675,Masala dosa. You going to Venmo or cash?
sxt4YCIsn2I,54675,57637,Dosa is a plate made of rice and lentil.
sxt4YCIsn2I,57637,59806,"It’s naturally fermented, totally gluten free."
sxt4YCIsn2I,60973,63809,And then served with a coconut chutney and a lentil soup.
sxt4YCIsn2I,63810,66437,Those will give you extra flavor when you dip it and eat.
sxt4YCIsn2I,66729,69189,"This is four different lentils, three different rice,"
sxt4YCIsn2I,69190,70274,nobody has that.
sxt4YCIsn2I,71150,72443,That’s my grandmother’s recipe.
sxt4YCIsn2I,73361,76614,We have samosas and then we have a Sri Lankan roti curry.
sxt4YCIsn2I,77448,79617,"Special Pondicherry, the most popular lunch,"
sxt4YCIsn2I,80159,82327,is a dosa with potato and vegetable.
sxt4YCIsn2I,82870,85873,You can come and take some shots while I’m cooking now.
sxt4YCIsn2I,86332,87792,Are you getting your usual?
sxt4YCIsn2I,87792,89168,"Number two, and spicy."
sxt4YCIsn2I,89669,91587,"Oh, terrific! Are you kidding?"
sxt4YCIsn2I,91587,92755,He’s the best.
sxt4YCIsn2I,92755,94173,I’ve been eating here for years.
sxt4YCIsn2I,94173,96591,You can tell it’s good because you have people coming from New Delhi
sxt4YCIsn2I,96592,98302,who come here to eat.
sxt4YCIsn2I,98886,100596,You want to have a quick look? Check it out.
sxt4YCIsn2I,100596,102431,You need more potato? That’s good.
sxt4YCIsn2I,102807,104976,People know me all around the world.
sxt4YCIsn2I,104976,106435,They always support me.
sxt4YCIsn2I,106435,108271,You can see they’re waiting for food.
sxt4YCIsn2I,109605,110773,I don’t want to--
sxt4YCIsn2I,111149,113109,They’re ready now? OK.
sxt4YCIsn2I,114026,115111,"OK, go ahead."
sxt4YCIsn2I,115111,116612,Thank you.
sxt4YCIsn2I,117280,118364,You’re a good man.
sxt4YCIsn2I,119782,123702,"Yeah. I’m originally from Sri Lanka, speak the South Indian Tamil."
sxt4YCIsn2I,123911,127039,I came to the United States almost 25 years ago.
sxt4YCIsn2I,128457,131794,"In Sri Lanka, in the beach area, not many restaurants in those days,"
sxt4YCIsn2I,131794,135756,"so we’d take some food from home and make it right by the beach,"
sxt4YCIsn2I,135756,137216,right after swimming and stuff.
sxt4YCIsn2I,137216,138384,"That’s how I first learned,"
sxt4YCIsn2I,138384,140761,and then I’ve learned from my grandmother and everything.
sxt4YCIsn2I,141387,142638,I love bikes too.
sxt4YCIsn2I,143014,145224,"Professional racing motorcycle, yeah."
sxt4YCIsn2I,145224,147518,"After I got married, I stopped."
sxt4YCIsn2I,148311,150146,It was a very fun life.
sxt4YCIsn2I,150146,152190,"Then after that, slowly the war starts,"
sxt4YCIsn2I,152190,155276,"the civil war between Tamil Tigers and the government,"
sxt4YCIsn2I,155276,157278,"and I won the lottery green card,"
sxt4YCIsn2I,157862,159947,so that’s why I came to the United States.
sxt4YCIsn2I,161073,163242,I came with my wife and one daughter.
sxt4YCIsn2I,163242,165828,"Third day, I started working on the construction field."
sxt4YCIsn2I,165828,167997,"Then I was working in the gas station,"
sxt4YCIsn2I,167997,169916,"and then I was working in the iron factory,"
sxt4YCIsn2I,170416,173711,and then I am helping my friends in Dosa Hutt in Flushing.
sxt4YCIsn2I,174629,177798,"You can have everything when you come to New York, you know?"
sxt4YCIsn2I,177798,179300,"You got to slowly, slowly, work hard,"
sxt4YCIsn2I,179300,181594,and then you can have a good life.
sxt4YCIsn2I,181594,183804,"In the beginning, when I started the cart,"
sxt4YCIsn2I,183804,187433,"everything almost cost me $13,000."
sxt4YCIsn2I,187767,191187,"I saved some money, and then I got some money from the credit cards,"
sxt4YCIsn2I,191187,193356,then I pay monthly instalments.
sxt4YCIsn2I,193356,195274,"Interest, interest."
sxt4YCIsn2I,195608,197693,"2001, December, we started."
sxt4YCIsn2I,197693,200196,"Those days, they were very tough."
sxt4YCIsn2I,200196,201948,"You know, there’s an economic crisis,"
sxt4YCIsn2I,201948,205243,"and a lot of hustlers, and not that safe."
sxt4YCIsn2I,205493,207078,You’ve got to be ready for anything.
sxt4YCIsn2I,207078,210539,"Otherwise, I would not step into New York from Sri Lanka."
sxt4YCIsn2I,210873,212208,"Spicy, as usual, right?"
sxt4YCIsn2I,212208,214293,"-Yeah. -You got it, brother."
sxt4YCIsn2I,214293,215336,There you go.
sxt4YCIsn2I,215336,217171,New York is a very busy city.
sxt4YCIsn2I,217171,220508,"Everyone’s running, no time for nothing,"
sxt4YCIsn2I,220508,222885,"so they’re craving for good, healthy food."
sxt4YCIsn2I,223344,225179,That’s why I started to do this.
sxt4YCIsn2I,225638,227598,"And it’s become a hit now, yeah."
sxt4YCIsn2I,228599,230726,"-Usual, right? -Extra, extra, extra."
sxt4YCIsn2I,230977,233437,"Fresh food gives you natural energy,"
sxt4YCIsn2I,233437,235690,"that’s why all the vegans are very happy, you know?"
sxt4YCIsn2I,236148,237858,"Thanks so much, see you tomorrow."
sxt4YCIsn2I,237858,240653,"That’s from famous newspaper, Indian newspaper."
sxt4YCIsn2I,241279,243739,"The Villager, it’s famous in this village right here,"
sxt4YCIsn2I,243739,245074,Greenwich Village.
sxt4YCIsn2I,245074,246701,They select the famous people.
sxt4YCIsn2I,246701,248160,Twice in this magazine.
sxt4YCIsn2I,249578,250579,"Look different, right?"
sxt4YCIsn2I,251706,252915,"Especially cooking food,"
sxt4YCIsn2I,252915,255668,my grandmother told me you have to put a lot of love into it.
sxt4YCIsn2I,255668,257377,"If you don’t love what you do,"
sxt4YCIsn2I,257377,259797,it’s very hard for you to come up in the business.
sxt4YCIsn2I,260965,264552,Even I didn’t think in the beginning I would be this famous.
sxt4YCIsn2I,265136,269431,"Yeah, now I have worldwide fans, 45 countries."
sxt4YCIsn2I,269432,272184,Let’s take a picture with this girl.
sxt4YCIsn2I,272184,273811,"She’s come from Houston, Texas."
sxt4YCIsn2I,273811,275771,"-Thanks, man. Thank you so much. -Thank you."
sxt4YCIsn2I,275771,277898,-Mine too? -OK.
sxt4YCIsn2I,277898,281027,"I found him on the internet, and I read his whole life story,"
sxt4YCIsn2I,281027,283237,"and I was like, “I have to eat there.”"
sxt4YCIsn2I,283779,285990,The food was awesome.
sxt4YCIsn2I,285990,288034,I got the Special Pondicherry.
sxt4YCIsn2I,288034,290536,"These are the most popular dosas, Special Pondicherry."
sxt4YCIsn2I,290870,294415,"They are potato, fresh veggies. Come with dried coconut, everything."
sxt4YCIsn2I,294415,297335,"It was great, and I sent pictures to all my friends,"
sxt4YCIsn2I,297335,299587,so they’re all drooling and they’re jealous.
sxt4YCIsn2I,300546,303007,The main thing is we want to maintain the quality.
sxt4YCIsn2I,303507,306427,We don’t want to disappoint the people who come back
sxt4YCIsn2I,306427,307928,from all over the world.
sxt4YCIsn2I,308512,309930,This is my own creation.
sxt4YCIsn2I,309930,312307,"Now even in India, they make the Pondicherry."
sxt4YCIsn2I,312308,315811,"Spicy Pondicherry, one samosa with all the sauce."
sxt4YCIsn2I,316812,319148,"Very early in the morning, I start cooking."
sxt4YCIsn2I,319148,323819,"First I wake up in my house and do some yoga, meditate,"
sxt4YCIsn2I,323819,326655,then warm up the car and get to Queens.
sxt4YCIsn2I,328032,329992,"This is kind of like a little Indian town,"
sxt4YCIsn2I,330576,332828,so you get all the Indian stores around here.
sxt4YCIsn2I,333329,337083,"And then on the way, I buy vegetables in Patel Brothers, where we shop."
sxt4YCIsn2I,337750,340753,"Yeah, get some vegetables for the next day’s soup and stuff."
sxt4YCIsn2I,341754,342838,Thank you.
sxt4YCIsn2I,342838,346217,"To the city now, where we’re going to set up by NYU."
sxt4YCIsn2I,349053,350763,"We start at 11:00, 11:30,"
sxt4YCIsn2I,350763,353724,and then we’ve run out of food by three o’clock.
sxt4YCIsn2I,354642,357186,Then Kamir sets up everything.
sxt4YCIsn2I,357186,360064,"He comes and helps me out, brings the stuff from the car."
sxt4YCIsn2I,360356,362400,"Yeah, as soon as we’re ready, people are ready to eat."
sxt4YCIsn2I,364193,365361,This is Lakshmi.
sxt4YCIsn2I,365861,367238,She brings me--
sxt4YCIsn2I,367238,369657,"and then this is Murugan, he’s the defense god."
sxt4YCIsn2I,369657,371742,I’m a big Shiva fan.
sxt4YCIsn2I,371742,372993,That’s why the symbol of Shiva.
sxt4YCIsn2I,374036,378249,"My daughter, she’s just graduated from Columbia University,"
sxt4YCIsn2I,378249,379792,Economics double major.
sxt4YCIsn2I,380709,383462,"I have a lot of NYU volunteers, a lot of students."
sxt4YCIsn2I,383462,385548,We keep everything under $10
sxt4YCIsn2I,385548,387425,"because some students have no money,"
sxt4YCIsn2I,387716,390594,"and some poor people also can have food, you know?"
sxt4YCIsn2I,390594,392346,I want food for everybody.
sxt4YCIsn2I,392346,393472,Man’s really friendly.
sxt4YCIsn2I,393472,396684,"I remember once I didn’t have any cash on me,"
sxt4YCIsn2I,396684,398436,"so [I said], “Hold it right there."
sxt4YCIsn2I,398436,400729,"I’ll run right back, and I’ll go to the ATM.”"
sxt4YCIsn2I,400729,402898,"He said, “No, no, just take it and you can pay me another time.”"
sxt4YCIsn2I,402898,405192,So it was great. And ever since then I’ve come back
sxt4YCIsn2I,405776,406986,"Yeah, and it’s cheap."
sxt4YCIsn2I,407194,409405,I'm on a budget. It's really cheap. It's really good.
sxt4YCIsn2I,409780,411282,I got a samosa dosa.
sxt4YCIsn2I,411282,412450,"It’s actually not on the menu,"
sxt4YCIsn2I,412450,415911,but he decided to put the samosa instead of the potatoes
sxt4YCIsn2I,415911,417204,to make samosa dosa.
sxt4YCIsn2I,417413,418706,"Hello, how you doing? New York Dosas."
sxt4YCIsn2I,419748,422668,"Let me get a Pondicherry, double sambar, and samosa."
sxt4YCIsn2I,422668,424253,"OK, no problem. Where are you?"
sxt4YCIsn2I,424628,426130,That guy in the limousine.
sxt4YCIsn2I,426797,428048,He wants a dosa?
sxt4YCIsn2I,428048,430968,Dosa and samosa with double sambar.
sxt4YCIsn2I,432553,434805,"When I started business here, I couldn’t see."
sxt4YCIsn2I,434805,437975,"But now I’m happy, I can see the World Trade Center from here."
sxt4YCIsn2I,437975,439101,The best view from here.
sxt4YCIsn2I,439935,441979,"I’m a New Yorker, yeah."
sxt4YCIsn2I,441979,444690,"Me, of course, man. I’ve lived here 25 years."
sxt4YCIsn2I,445441,448194,"That’s why this represents New York Dosas, you know?"
sxt4YCIsn2I,448194,450946,"Pondicherry, medium, masala, pretty spicy."
sxt4YCIsn2I,451405,454450,"New York Dosa, the next five years you will see us in the park."
sxt4YCIsn2I,454450,457411,But right after my contract expires in five years?
sxt4YCIsn2I,457411,458537,We don’t know.
sxt4YCIsn2I,458537,461499,"We might continue doing it, or maybe no more."
sxt4YCIsn2I,462958,466378,"Right now, I want to do it as long as I have energy in my body."
sxt4YCIsn2I,466378,467880,"But when I have no energy,"
sxt4YCIsn2I,467880,470216,then I’m going to stop and do something else.
sxt4YCIsn2I,471091,472092,"Try to be happy,"
sxt4YCIsn2I,472092,474678,"because in this world, everything is temporary."
sxt4YCIsn2I,474678,476263,So you should be happy.
sxt4YCIsn2I,476263,478516,That’s what my grandmother told me.
sxt4YCIsn2I,478766,481477,"Nothing is permanent, so you should be happy with what you got."
