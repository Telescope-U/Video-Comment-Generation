5xeE5-CXtAU,269420,275440,[Music]  so this little box here was some more
5xeE5-CXtAU,275440,282000,spray way products that i am going to be  trying out i haven't tried them yet but  i have been using a lot of the spray
5xeE5-CXtAU,282000,287440,away products recently i've shown you  guys in the last few videos but the  all-purpose cleaner the glass cleaner
5xeE5-CXtAU,287440,293840,and the stainless steel cleaner i've  been using constantly but they also have  several cleaners that come in wipes form
5xeE5-CXtAU,293840,299199,so i'm going to test those out and let  you guys know what i think of them all  right now i'm unloading the dishwasher
5xeE5-CXtAU,299199,305039,and this is something that i'd typically  do in the mornings as well but i forgot  to run the dishwasher the night before
5xeE5-CXtAU,305039,312400,so i had to start it first thing in the  morning and now my dishes are done so  i'm gonna put these away and then of
5xeE5-CXtAU,312400,318759,course i've got all the dishes from  after dinner that i need to put away  [Music]
5xeE5-CXtAU,318759,336800,nobody told me  [Music]
5xeE5-CXtAU,336800,346199,you're crazy for saying i should slow  down but maybe i'm escaping the love we
5xeE5-CXtAU,346199,352320,found about you  something about your life
5xeE5-CXtAU,352320,360029,[Music]
5xeE5-CXtAU,360319,365520,so since it's summertime i do feel like  all of our routines are so different
5xeE5-CXtAU,365520,371440,than during the school year at our house  so last week i actually shared a video
5xeE5-CXtAU,371440,378479,where i talked about my summer weekly  cleaning routine it's not all set in  stone i'm not perfect with it i don't
5xeE5-CXtAU,378479,384880,necessarily get every single thing done  on the day that i planned it  but i do try to my best to like stick to
5xeE5-CXtAU,384880,390639,the schedule as much as possible but  with the kids being home for the summer  they have lots of different things like
5xeE5-CXtAU,390639,396639,camps and practices um you know we try  to do fun activities throughout the week
5xeE5-CXtAU,396639,402800,as well and then also vacations so  there's just a lot of different factors  that can kind of throw us off of our
5xeE5-CXtAU,402800,408160,routine that i've even made for the  summer but for the most part we try to  stick with it the kids also have chores
5xeE5-CXtAU,408160,414400,that they have to do and since we are  home a lot more during the summer they  have been really good about sticking to
5xeE5-CXtAU,414400,419759,those chores and  they get paid for all that and actually  talked about that in the last couple of
5xeE5-CXtAU,419759,425520,videos as well  but i would love to hear from you guys  how is your summer going how are your
5xeE5-CXtAU,425520,431360,routines is it different during the  summer than the school year i know a lot  of you are working moms so your kids may
5xeE5-CXtAU,431360,436639,go to camps during the summer and your  routine is pretty much the same as  during the school year but then there's
5xeE5-CXtAU,436639,442880,also  moms that work from home and have their  kids home with them or stay at home moms
5xeE5-CXtAU,442880,448560,have their kids home with them so i  would just love to hear how's your  summer going how are your routines and
5xeE5-CXtAU,448560,455520,y'all be sure to read the comment  section too because i'm sure that  there's lots of moms that you're gonna  be able to relate with down in the
5xeE5-CXtAU,455520,467120,comment section  [Music]
5xeE5-CXtAU,467120,474610,nobody loves me better  [Music]  nobody loves me better
5xeE5-CXtAU,474610,482240,[Music]  yes i'm just too scared to settle down
5xeE5-CXtAU,482240,490000,that'd be many nights i got too high and  almost left  but there's something about you
5xeE5-CXtAU,490000,497120,something about  [Music]
5xeE5-CXtAU,497120,503440,okay i've got two fresh sponges this one  is going to go here on the sink that's
5xeE5-CXtAU,503440,509039,what i used to wash my dishes with and  then i also  use another sponge that i keep down here
5xeE5-CXtAU,509039,515120,in this little caddy underneath my sink  and this is the one that i always clean  the stove with so i did want to kind of
5xeE5-CXtAU,515120,521360,point that out in case you thought i was  using the same sponge on my stove to  clean my dishes that's not the case i
5xeE5-CXtAU,521360,527680,have two different sponges and these are  actually the walnut scrubber sponges  that are from grove collaborative i love
5xeE5-CXtAU,527680,533920,these sponges especially for  washing dishes and  cleaning different areas of the house i
5xeE5-CXtAU,533920,539920,also love scrub daddy sponges as well  they're just a little bit more expensive  but they are definitely the best for
5xeE5-CXtAU,539920,545200,like the  bigger messes i would say and i also use  the scrub daddy sponge in the sink all
5xeE5-CXtAU,545200,550800,the time  and here on my stove top i'm actually  spraying the method degreaser i let it
5xeE5-CXtAU,550800,556320,sit for just a minute and then i will  take a wet sponge and i will just work
5xeE5-CXtAU,556320,562160,anything that's like caked on there off  and honestly my stove was not that bad  i'm surprised because usually when i
5xeE5-CXtAU,562160,568240,cook ground beef or anything else for  that matter on the stove it usually gets  everywhere but
5xeE5-CXtAU,568240,574640,we didn't make too much of a mess  tonight so i'm cleaning this up  and  i'm just wiping everything up with a
5xeE5-CXtAU,574640,589760,microfiber cloth  [Music]
5xeE5-CXtAU,589760,598000,i also have these little scrapers i got  in a set off of amazon and i am just  using it to get any food or crumbs from
5xeE5-CXtAU,598000,605279,between  you know where the stove meets the  countertop and you can also use it to  scrape any caked on food off of your
5xeE5-CXtAU,605279,612160,countertop as well and then here i'm  using the grove co multi-purpose cleaner  just to wipe down the countertops really
5xeE5-CXtAU,612160,627519,quick  [Music]
5xeE5-CXtAU,627519,633839,now we're back at the sink and i'm  actually going to clean the sink out now  um typically i try to wait until i'm
5xeE5-CXtAU,633839,639279,almost done cleaning the kitchen to  clean my sink because  if i clean my sink right after i get
5xeE5-CXtAU,639279,644800,done doing dishes it never fails i end  up finding more dishes that need to be  washed and
5xeE5-CXtAU,644800,650959,i have to rewash my sink so i try to do  it more towards the end of my kitchen  cleaning routine so i'm going to clean
5xeE5-CXtAU,650959,657440,it out real quick i'm using the dawn  power wash and a scrub daddy or scrub  mommy actually is that that's that one
5xeE5-CXtAU,657440,663020,and  it smells so much better now that it's  all clean
5xeE5-CXtAU,663020,678549,[Music]
5xeE5-CXtAU,680079,687640,nobody loves me better yet  i get too drunk
5xeE5-CXtAU,688260,696830,[Music]
5xeE5-CXtAU,696830,702240,[Applause]  nobody loves me bad  nobody
5xeE5-CXtAU,702240,709600,now the last product i'm using here in  the kitchen is the method wood cleaner  this stuff smells amazing it's an almond
5xeE5-CXtAU,709600,715519,scent and i love it so much that i  pretty much talk about it in every  single video and if you've been here for
5xeE5-CXtAU,715519,719839,a while then you're probably sick of  hearing me talk about it
5xeE5-CXtAU,721360,726720,all right let me introduce you to the  innova neu 700 by eureka
5xeE5-CXtAU,726720,732480,it is a state of the art ultra powerful  upright vacuum cleaner with a whirlwind
5xeE5-CXtAU,732480,737839,anti-tangle brush roll and it's also  engineered for whole house deep cleaning
5xeE5-CXtAU,737839,743120,i told you guys that i wanted to be able  to find a vacuum that is corded for deep
5xeE5-CXtAU,743120,751440,cleaning super powerful and a great  price that i could recommend to you guys  and this one checks all of the boxes
5xeE5-CXtAU,751440,757519,this vacuum has complete seal hepa  filtration that traps 99 of dust dander
5xeE5-CXtAU,757519,763279,and allergens this vacuum has adjustable  quiet and max power modes and you can
5xeE5-CXtAU,763279,768800,also change between hard floors or  carpet settings the anti-static dust bin
5xeE5-CXtAU,768800,776079,is extra large and holds so much which  is amazing because i can actually vacuum  the entire downstairs before having to
5xeE5-CXtAU,776079,782800,empty it  it also has big wheel swivel steering so  it turns super easy and then there's a
5xeE5-CXtAU,782800,790720,light at the bottom of the vacuum so  that way you can see the dust on the  floors or even see underneath furniture
5xeE5-CXtAU,790959,797440,my favorite part about this vacuum is  the whirlwind anti-tangle brush roll  this was another must-have that i had on
5xeE5-CXtAU,797440,804160,my checklist that i told you guys about  but the anti-tangle brush roll is  actively breaking hair as you're
5xeE5-CXtAU,804160,811360,vacuuming to prevent it from tangling up  in the brush roll and also to prevent  clogging up in the vacuum
5xeE5-CXtAU,811360,817120,the anti-tangle brush roll makes it so  much easier  to take care of your vacuum too and this
5xeE5-CXtAU,817120,822399,is just my opinion but it just makes it  so much easier because you're not having  to clean a whole bunch of hair out of
5xeE5-CXtAU,822399,827920,your vacuum and it getting clogged up  all the time  so this has definitely become a
5xeE5-CXtAU,827920,834199,must-have feature for me when i'm  looking for a vacuum  the innova
5xeE5-CXtAU,834199,840000,neu700 also comes with several different  accessories including a motorized
5xeE5-CXtAU,840000,847040,anti-tangle pet tool for cleaning on  stairs and upholstery and then it also  comes with an under furniture crevice
5xeE5-CXtAU,847040,852959,tool that's the skinnier tool that is  so great for cleaning in between like
5xeE5-CXtAU,852959,860800,hard to reach places like in between  your couch cushions in your car  your baseboards all those kind of things
5xeE5-CXtAU,860800,867199,and then the last accessory that it  comes with is a two in one dusting brush  and i like to use this for dusting our
5xeE5-CXtAU,867199,872800,blinds but you can also use them on your  fan blades or anywhere else that you
5xeE5-CXtAU,872800,879440,would typically do some dusting  now as you can see i'm moving from the  rug here to the hard floor and i just
5xeE5-CXtAU,879440,884480,push the little button here on the  trigger and it just changes modes it's  so easy
5xeE5-CXtAU,884480,889519,that way when you're switching back and  forth between floors and carpets
5xeE5-CXtAU,889519,896880,it just makes it really easy to switch  modes  now this vacuum was made exclusively for
5xeE5-CXtAU,896880,903199,walmart and i'm actually looking at the  website right now as i'm editing this  video and the original price for this
5xeE5-CXtAU,903199,909680,vacuum is 269 dollars but it is  currently on a rollback so it is 198
5xeE5-CXtAU,909680,916639,dollars right now and i feel like that  is a great deal for this vacuum so i'm  actually going to have a link to this
5xeE5-CXtAU,916639,922800,particular vacuum down in my description  box i'll also leave it in the comments  so it's easy for you guys to find in
5xeE5-CXtAU,922800,929120,case you want to check out this vacuum  for yourselves  and thank you to eureka vacuums for
5xeE5-CXtAU,929120,938860,partnering with me on today's video  [Music]
5xeE5-CXtAU,940800,948399,didn't care about the rules good on the  weekends  i'll be in fools drifting to deep space
5xeE5-CXtAU,948399,953970,so brave and so stupid just like the  movies how it's gonna
5xeE5-CXtAU,953970,963600,[Music]
5xeE5-CXtAU,963600,967560,you and me so clueless
5xeE5-CXtAU,969280,976369,[Music]
5xeE5-CXtAU,979120,991680,we were in  [Music]
5xeE5-CXtAU,991680,998580,oh  today
5xeE5-CXtAU,998580,1014560,[Music]
5xeE5-CXtAU,1014560,1021839,now that i'm done vacuuming the floors  i'm going to use the anti-tangle pet  tool to vacuum our couches really quick
5xeE5-CXtAU,1021839,1027120,and in case you guys didn't know we have  three cats that we got back in october
5xeE5-CXtAU,1027120,1035199,don't even ask how that happened  let's just say i've got a very  persuasive cat obsessed little girl
5xeE5-CXtAU,1035199,1041038,but our cats are actually indoor outdoor  cats and they love taking naps here on
5xeE5-CXtAU,1041038,1047678,the couches so i'm definitely gonna have  to vacuum them more often because i've  been noticing cat hair on my clothes
5xeE5-CXtAU,1047678,1055280,lately and on the kids clothes now we  did have a chocolate lab but he passed  away back in february and he was the
5xeE5-CXtAU,1055280,1060480,best dog ever but since he's been gone i  have noticed that i don't get near as
5xeE5-CXtAU,1060480,1067840,much pet hair from the carpets even with  having the three cats but they're  outdoors a lot of the time so maybe that
5xeE5-CXtAU,1067840,1074470,is why we don't have nearly as much cat  hair on the floors and all over the  house
5xeE5-CXtAU,1074470,1080229,[Music]
5xeE5-CXtAU,1082680,1095000,[Music]
5xeE5-CXtAU,1095000,1101570,[Applause]  just like the movies
5xeE5-CXtAU,1101570,1109200,[Music]
5xeE5-CXtAU,1109200,1116160,okay here is the canister after i'm done  and keep in mind i do have a robot  vacuum that goes off daily so this was
5xeE5-CXtAU,1116160,1121760,already after the robot vacuum had gone  off another thing that i really like  about this canister is that the lid
5xeE5-CXtAU,1121760,1127840,opens up all the way instead of  just to a 90 degree angle it opens up to  180
5xeE5-CXtAU,1127840,1132880,so this stuff doesn't get stuck in there  or just get all over the lid and here
5xeE5-CXtAU,1132880,1139520,you can see there's absolutely no hair  wrapped around it actually looks brand  new like i didn't even just vacuum so
5xeE5-CXtAU,1139520,1145210,love this vacuum you all will have to  check it out the link is in my  description box
5xeE5-CXtAU,1145210,1157870,[Music]
5xeE5-CXtAU,1157870,1164400,[Applause]  okay the house is all nice and clean but  i did want to show you the recipe that
5xeE5-CXtAU,1164400,1170559,we did tonight we do tacos a lot this is  just a go-to recipe in our house because
5xeE5-CXtAU,1170559,1175760,everybody eats it and it's one of those  things that we could eat multiple times  a week if we wanted to
5xeE5-CXtAU,1175760,1181600,so i'm just browning my meat i have  about two and a half pounds because a  lot of times we will save the meat and
5xeE5-CXtAU,1181600,1189520,eat  the leftovers for lunch the next day  especially during the summer  but first i'm going to make these
5xeE5-CXtAU,1189520,1196400,i guess they're called gordita crunch is  that what it is from taco bell  so i'm just taking some flour tortillas
5xeE5-CXtAU,1196400,1203120,putting some shredded cheese on top  and then you could go ahead and melt the  cheese just a little bit by just kind of
5xeE5-CXtAU,1203120,1208400,nuking it in the microwave if you wanted  to but i'm not doing that i'm just  literally putting these around the hard
5xeE5-CXtAU,1208400,1214799,shell taco because i have these little  taco holders  and they will keep the tortilla onto the
5xeE5-CXtAU,1214799,1220320,taco shell so i'm gonna put those in  there i made six and then cason didn't
5xeE5-CXtAU,1220320,1226640,want any so i just made him regular  shells and i just popped them in the  oven on 350 for about eight minutes and
5xeE5-CXtAU,1226640,1233760,then we are gonna stuff these i have  several different toppings so we've got  shredded lettuce some sour cream and
5xeE5-CXtAU,1233760,1239120,then  this pico de gallo is my favorite it's  from publix so i always get these for
5xeE5-CXtAU,1239120,1245360,taco night and then these are our other  little taco stands that we use on our  plates they're plastic ones that i got
5xeE5-CXtAU,1245360,1252000,off of amazon so we don't touch the hot  ones oh and i also have some shredded  cheese to put on here as well i will say
5xeE5-CXtAU,1252000,1257440,that these are so filling so you're  probably not going to be able to eat a  whole lot of them compared to just a
5xeE5-CXtAU,1257440,1263600,regular taco but they are really good  and like i said they're a super easy  meal that you can make on a weeknight
5xeE5-CXtAU,1263600,1268720,just when you're in a hurry  it is now the next day and we are going
5xeE5-CXtAU,1268720,1273760,to be doing some outdoor cleaning we're  going to be cleaning up here in the  garage you can see we have a huge mess
5xeE5-CXtAU,1273760,1279280,but we're going to actually start by  pressure washing kayson's baseball pants  this was the first thing on our list to
5xeE5-CXtAU,1279280,1284960,do today because we are playing a  baseball tournament  um a few days after i was filming this
5xeE5-CXtAU,1284960,1290080,we had a baseball tournament and so  he needed his white jersey clean and it
5xeE5-CXtAU,1290080,1295840,was obviously very dirty so this is a  little tip i've shared it before but if  you have kids that play sports
5xeE5-CXtAU,1295840,1302400,um the pressure washer is perfect for  cleaning off the baseball pants so we  always pressure wash them first and then
5xeE5-CXtAU,1302400,1309400,i will spot treat them and throw them in  the washing machine and then i hang his  jerseys and pants to dry
5xeE5-CXtAU,1309400,1328890,[Music]
5xeE5-CXtAU,1330799,1335950,such a magic feeling we tore down my  walls
5xeE5-CXtAU,1335950,1342559,[Music]  i wish i could go back  to right before you told me i'd try to
5xeE5-CXtAU,1342559,1358240,change it all  but  [Music]
5xeE5-CXtAU,1358240,1363919,and i just know things will never so  this day was so hot and so humid while
5xeE5-CXtAU,1363919,1369200,we were cleaning so we have these little  mister fans that um you sit them on top
5xeE5-CXtAU,1369200,1374559,of the bucket the bucket has water in it  it has a little hose and so it's  spraying out water as the fan is on as
5xeE5-CXtAU,1374559,1380400,well so we have these out here we  typically use them for baseball games  but we wanted them on while we were
5xeE5-CXtAU,1380400,1386159,cleaning to help us stay a little bit  cool when we would go stand in front of  them so the first thing that we're going
5xeE5-CXtAU,1386159,1392799,to do here is just get as much as we can  pulled out of the garage  and then we're going to start doing a
5xeE5-CXtAU,1392799,1398080,little bit of cleaning  so last year i did a whole garage
5xeE5-CXtAU,1398080,1404559,organization video if you want to check  that out i will link it down below so  you can kind of see what our garage  looked like before
5xeE5-CXtAU,1404559,1411840,and  what it looked like after we organized  it  now there are some things that i still  really love about it like this um like
5xeE5-CXtAU,1411840,1418000,this organizer that i have here for all  the sports stuff i still love that the  kids know exactly where to put all of
5xeE5-CXtAU,1418000,1423360,their like sports equipment and balls  and things like that so that works great
5xeE5-CXtAU,1423360,1428640,however our shoe rack is a mess we have  just way too many like athletic type
5xeE5-CXtAU,1428640,1434880,shoes or shoes that we like to keep out  in the garage that they wear outside  frequently so we like to keep them out
5xeE5-CXtAU,1434880,1441039,here but i just do not like the way that  it is because we have too many so  i was looking at getting some sort of
5xeE5-CXtAU,1441039,1446880,haul tree where we could have baskets or  something for each of us to put our  shoes in
5xeE5-CXtAU,1446880,1452799,i don't know i've been looking for a  while and i haven't found anything that  i like yet but moving on we're looking
5xeE5-CXtAU,1452799,1459120,at our outdoor fridge this is where we  keep all of our drinks  and for some reason in the back if you
5xeE5-CXtAU,1459120,1464799,put um any kind of drink way in the back  of this fridge then it freezes so we had
5xeE5-CXtAU,1464799,1471360,not only was that a diet dr pepper can  that had exploded but also  one of my premier protein shakes
5xeE5-CXtAU,1471360,1477760,exploded in there so i'm cleaning that  mess up before we restock the fridge
5xeE5-CXtAU,1479600,1486320,so i did start off by wiping these  little shelves down first and then i  realized that they definitely needed to
5xeE5-CXtAU,1486320,1492320,be washed so i pulled them out and  washed them with some dawn power wash  while we were outside i used just some
5xeE5-CXtAU,1492320,1498880,dawn power wash a sponge and the hose  really quick  and that worked great
5xeE5-CXtAU,1498880,1512320,strangers  [Music]
5xeE5-CXtAU,1512320,1522860,like strangers  [Music]
5xeE5-CXtAU,1522860,1528480,[Applause]  could have tried much harder
5xeE5-CXtAU,1528480,1535200,all we have are scars  he said we'd get so high
5xeE5-CXtAU,1535200,1548630,higher up than heaven  [Music]
5xeE5-CXtAU,1551120,1560960,this is who we are  and i just know  [Music]
5xeE5-CXtAU,1560960,1566480,now that that's all cleaned up i am  going to restock the fridge with some of  our favorite drinks we've got all of our
5xeE5-CXtAU,1566480,1571679,protein shakes out here some for the  kids some for us um i'm not crazy about
5xeE5-CXtAU,1571679,1577679,these celsius peach vibe drinks but i  love the ilani news  and then the kids really like these
5xeE5-CXtAU,1577679,1583600,minute made fruit punch these come in  the can  but these last us a really long time
5xeE5-CXtAU,1583600,1588640,because they have a ton of sugar in them  so usually we make them split again
5xeE5-CXtAU,1588640,1595919,if they have one during the week and  then sometimes we'll let them have a  whole can on the weekends and then of  course we've got diet dr pepper y'all
5xeE5-CXtAU,1595919,1602159,will have to let me know what's your  favorite drink of choice mine would  always be  diet dr pepper
5xeE5-CXtAU,1602159,1609919,and then we also have the sparkling ice  waters that i'm going to put in here and  then regular waters now because of the
5xeE5-CXtAU,1609919,1616960,explosions and the drinks freezing in  the back of the fridge i did  make sure to pull them all up a little
5xeE5-CXtAU,1616960,1623279,bit further  so hopefully none of our drinks will  explode in there again but
5xeE5-CXtAU,1623279,1648960,i don't know we'll have to see  [Music]
5xeE5-CXtAU,1648960,1655679,oh and i forgot we have capri suns as  well we really like getting the roaring  waters because they're just basically
5xeE5-CXtAU,1655679,1661200,flavored waters but i have not been able  to find them in stock anywhere lately so
5xeE5-CXtAU,1661200,1666640,i just got a whole bunch of capri suns  and these are just the regular capri  suns
5xeE5-CXtAU,1666640,1672610,all right our drink fridge is restocked  and ready to go
5xeE5-CXtAU,1672610,1683600,[Music]
5xeE5-CXtAU,1683600,1689840,okay now that we have most everything  pulled out we're gonna actually throw  away that little carpet right there it
5xeE5-CXtAU,1689840,1697679,was so disgusting  um and then chance is just using the  blower to get all the dirt and leaves
5xeE5-CXtAU,1697679,1704559,and everything out he even tried blowing  up like close to where the ceilings were  and in the corners of
5xeE5-CXtAU,1704559,1710640,the walls where all the cobwebs and  things like that were but we did end up  you'll see us in a little bit we're
5xeE5-CXtAU,1710640,1716799,using a broom and then i also have some  little duster tool thing that i got off
5xeE5-CXtAU,1716799,1723679,of amazon that i'm using to kind of get  in the nooks and crannies where  the blower did not get all that stuff
5xeE5-CXtAU,1723679,1730000,down  it's time to get my head up again
5xeE5-CXtAU,1730000,1735120,you said that you had to  i'll try to forget you
5xeE5-CXtAU,1735120,1741760,just didn't think we'd end up this way  like strangers
5xeE5-CXtAU,1742279,1752650,against strangers  [Music]
5xeE5-CXtAU,1753039,1758720,oh  strangers
5xeE5-CXtAU,1758720,1766559,[Music]  [Applause]  [Music]
5xeE5-CXtAU,1766559,1774080,now the wall right here and the door  where we go from  the garage into our house is super dirty
5xeE5-CXtAU,1774080,1780399,so i'm going to use this foaming wall  cleaner by zapp  to clean it as much as possible but if i
5xeE5-CXtAU,1780399,1786480,wanted it to be perfect we would  definitely have to repaint the walls  right here and since it's the garage i'm
5xeE5-CXtAU,1786480,1792399,really not going to worry about it now  the door came up really nice and clean  there was one little smudge mark that i
5xeE5-CXtAU,1792399,1798159,did not  get off but i could probably get a magic  eraser to it i just completely forgot
5xeE5-CXtAU,1798159,1803679,about it before i finished filming the  video and by the time we were done i  mean we were scorching
5xeE5-CXtAU,1803679,1810720,hot  so i didn't get that little smudge that  you can see right there at the bottom  right of our door it didn't come all the
5xeE5-CXtAU,1810720,1817750,way off with the wall cleaner but like i  said i could probably get a magic eraser  on it and it would work well
5xeE5-CXtAU,1817750,1828869,[Music]
5xeE5-CXtAU,1831100,1845220,[Music]
5xeE5-CXtAU,1845220,1851279,[Applause]  [Music]  things you could be the part where it

5xeE5-CXtAU,1955440,1960720,cleaning that we're gonna do  and now we're gonna just start putting  some things back in and my camera
5xeE5-CXtAU,1960720,1966799,actually overheated so it wouldn't stay  on for very long so i'm just going to  kind of show you in clips as we're
5xeE5-CXtAU,1966799,1973679,putting things back into the garage  now these are gracie june's tumbling  mats and unfortunately we have nowhere
5xeE5-CXtAU,1973679,1979600,else to put these i wish that we had a  different space but this is just what we  have to work with and then all this
5xeE5-CXtAU,1979600,1985519,stuff right here is actually all of our  stuff for baseball and typically the  chairs and the wagons everything gets
5xeE5-CXtAU,1985519,1992080,put out up on top of the hanging ceiling  shelf but because we had a tournament  the next day all this was actually about
5xeE5-CXtAU,1992080,1998399,to get put into my car so we didn't want  to put it away because we needed to use  all this stuff the next day
