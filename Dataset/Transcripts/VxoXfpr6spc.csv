VxoXfpr6spc,560,2159,as of recent i have been speedrunning
VxoXfpr6spc,2159,4799,minecraft java edition version 1.16 as a
VxoXfpr6spc,4799,6160,means of mastering a game i've been
VxoXfpr6spc,6160,7839,playing for almost a decade now i have
VxoXfpr6spc,7839,9360,found solace in speedrunning by being
VxoXfpr6spc,9360,10960,able to adapt to your environments and
VxoXfpr6spc,10960,12320,to test your game knowledge as the
VxoXfpr6spc,12320,14240,forefront in improving one's time by no
VxoXfpr6spc,14240,15759,means am i the best speedrunner of all
VxoXfpr6spc,15759,17760,time and have only pb'd at 50 minutes in
VxoXfpr6spc,17760,19520,hopes of getting a sub 30 one day
VxoXfpr6spc,19520,21439,however the other day i was recommended
VxoXfpr6spc,21439,23039,a video that detailed the inner workings
VxoXfpr6spc,23039,24960,of minecraft education edition in which
VxoXfpr6spc,24960,26800,i thought to myself i wonder how speed
VxoXfpr6spc,26800,28400,running minecraft education edition
VxoXfpr6spc,28400,30320,would go and if that's even possible
VxoXfpr6spc,30320,32000,with that thought i downloaded minecraft
VxoXfpr6spc,32000,34239,education edition loaded up a world and
VxoXfpr6spc,34239,36399,set foot on a quest a quest in which i
VxoXfpr6spc,36399,39920,was not aware of what lied ahead
VxoXfpr6spc,40800,42399,so the second that the world started i
VxoXfpr6spc,42399,44160,did the exact same thing as always i
VxoXfpr6spc,44160,46719,mined a tree got stone tools and looted
VxoXfpr6spc,46719,47760,a village
VxoXfpr6spc,47760,49520,and upon reaching that village i began
VxoXfpr6spc,49520,51039,to notice some differences in the game's
VxoXfpr6spc,51039,53120,mechanics opposed to java edition for
VxoXfpr6spc,53120,54719,starters the hoe didn't mind the hay
VxoXfpr6spc,54719,56879,bales at the now buff speeds and my axe
VxoXfpr6spc,56879,58800,crits never had to recharge nor crack
VxoXfpr6spc,58800,61199,the iron golem at this moment i realized
VxoXfpr6spc,61199,62800,that this was the old combat mechanics
VxoXfpr6spc,62800,64239,and that bedrock edition was the source
VxoXfpr6spc,64239,66240,for education edition with his new gain
VxoXfpr6spc,66240,68159,knowledge i set forth looking for a lava
VxoXfpr6spc,68159,69920,pool yet my mind was constantly trying
VxoXfpr6spc,69920,71280,to think of the differences that lied
VxoXfpr6spc,71280,73119,ahead of the run after what felt like
VxoXfpr6spc,73119,75040,forever in speed run terms i found a
VxoXfpr6spc,75040,76640,lava pool that just so happened to be
VxoXfpr6spc,76640,78799,the exact size and lava needed in order
VxoXfpr6spc,78799,80640,to create another portal and upon
VxoXfpr6spc,80640,82560,completion set my spawn point as a
VxoXfpr6spc,82560,84840,precautionary of course and entered the
VxoXfpr6spc,84840,86640,nether
VxoXfpr6spc,86640,88400,and another fortress at the same time
VxoXfpr6spc,88400,90159,the next step in completing this run is
VxoXfpr6spc,90159,92159,obviously to obtain blaze rods in order
VxoXfpr6spc,92159,93920,to create eyes of enders to locate the
VxoXfpr6spc,93920,96640,end portal as time went on my inability
VxoXfpr6spc,96640,98320,to locate a blaze spawner led me to
VxoXfpr6spc,98320,100159,believe that a blaze spawner didn't
VxoXfpr6spc,100159,102159,spawn in another fortress as a means of
VxoXfpr6spc,102159,103680,not letting kids who are at school
VxoXfpr6spc,103680,105759,obviously to beat minecraft when they
VxoXfpr6spc,105759,107360,should be paying attention to a coding
VxoXfpr6spc,107360,109439,lesson fortunately for myself when that
VxoXfpr6spc,109439,110960,thought entered my mind i instantly
VxoXfpr6spc,110960,112560,found a blaze spawner and couldn't have
VxoXfpr6spc,112560,114640,been more relieved that i was wrong yet
VxoXfpr6spc,114640,116479,my troubles only seemed to increase from
VxoXfpr6spc,116479,118719,here you see as i killed the last couple
VxoXfpr6spc,118719,120640,of blazes that i needed i realized what
VxoXfpr6spc,120640,122880,seemed so off from the beginning the hoe
VxoXfpr6spc,122880,124240,didn't seem to mind the hay bale
VxoXfpr6spc,124240,126000,accordingly because it was an older
VxoXfpr6spc,126000,128800,version of minecraft as that sadly sank
VxoXfpr6spc,128800,130479,in i looked around for gold on the
VxoXfpr6spc,130479,132400,ceilings in desperation and the walls of
VxoXfpr6spc,132400,133520,the nether
VxoXfpr6spc,133520,135280,and there was not a single piece of gold
VxoXfpr6spc,135280,138239,to be found 1.16 wasn't in this edition
VxoXfpr6spc,138239,140239,of minecraft my go-to method of
VxoXfpr6spc,140239,142239,speedrunning didn't apply here as there
VxoXfpr6spc,142239,143680,were no means of getting pearls by
VxoXfpr6spc,143680,145440,trading gold with piglens
VxoXfpr6spc,145440,147920,i began to panic and think of a solution
VxoXfpr6spc,147920,150000,as i left another knowing there was
VxoXfpr6spc,150000,151760,nothing left for me there i decided to
VxoXfpr6spc,151760,153680,run in one direction in hopes of finding
VxoXfpr6spc,153680,155280,an enderman to kill in order to make a
VxoXfpr6spc,155280,157280,single eye of ender to at least know the
VxoXfpr6spc,157280,158959,direction i should be running towards
VxoXfpr6spc,158959,160879,the first enderman didn't drop a pearl
VxoXfpr6spc,160879,162319,but instantly afterwards my
VxoXfpr6spc,162319,163920,disappointment was relieved and i found
VxoXfpr6spc,163920,165760,another one and upon killing it it
VxoXfpr6spc,165760,167040,dropped a pearl
VxoXfpr6spc,167040,169440,i created a single eye of ender threw it
VxoXfpr6spc,169440,172560,and then watched it break into pieces
VxoXfpr6spc,172560,173760,soon after heading towards that
VxoXfpr6spc,173760,175280,direction i found a desert and
VxoXfpr6spc,175280,176800,remembered old speed runs involved
VxoXfpr6spc,176800,178720,creating boats sitting in a desert at
VxoXfpr6spc,178720,180400,night and killing endermen in order to
VxoXfpr6spc,180400,182319,obtain pearls i tried this method and
VxoXfpr6spc,182319,184319,had absolutely no luck which i now
VxoXfpr6spc,184319,186319,accredit to the strange occurrences of
VxoXfpr6spc,186319,187920,entities spawning in a chunk by chunk
VxoXfpr6spc,187920,190239,basis which is identical to bedrocks
VxoXfpr6spc,190239,192000,after a grueling walk through the desert
VxoXfpr6spc,192000,194000,i was in between a temple and a savannah
VxoXfpr6spc,194000,195519,village i then realized the method of
VxoXfpr6spc,195519,198000,speedrunning prior to 1.16 was through
VxoXfpr6spc,198000,199840,trading with villagers for emeralds with
VxoXfpr6spc,199840,201840,sticks these sticks were then traded
VxoXfpr6spc,201840,203840,with another villager that gave you
VxoXfpr6spc,203840,205920,pearls i then decided to rate the temple
VxoXfpr6spc,205920,207440,of its resources in hopes of getting
VxoXfpr6spc,207440,209599,better gear and its tnt as well as to
VxoXfpr6spc,209599,211040,sleep right before entering the village
VxoXfpr6spc,211040,213040,to avoid a villager dying to a zombie
VxoXfpr6spc,213040,214319,since i didn't know the process of
VxoXfpr6spc,214319,215920,trading for pearls i looked up a youtube
VxoXfpr6spc,215920,217920,video watched it as i had difficulties
VxoXfpr6spc,217920,219680,corralling villagers accidentally
VxoXfpr6spc,219680,221680,hitting them and the tiresome burden of
VxoXfpr6spc,221680,223120,changing their professions once i
VxoXfpr6spc,223120,224879,managed to start the trading process i
VxoXfpr6spc,224879,226400,realized this process was going to take
VxoXfpr6spc,226400,228720,a long time maybe i did it wrong or
VxoXfpr6spc,228720,230640,should have reset them constantly but i
VxoXfpr6spc,230640,232799,wasn't risking it after being 40 minutes
VxoXfpr6spc,232799,234959,into the run after another 20 minutes of
VxoXfpr6spc,234959,236879,repeating the cycle of trading sticks
VxoXfpr6spc,236879,239120,with villagers getting a pearl
VxoXfpr6spc,239120,241040,destroying their entire life's work
VxoXfpr6spc,241040,242640,wondering why the stupid green villager
VxoXfpr6spc,242640,244720,wouldn't aid me in my quest i finally
VxoXfpr6spc,244720,246560,got the needed 12 ender pearls to finish
VxoXfpr6spc,246560,248480,my run however i wanted more ender
VxoXfpr6spc,248480,250159,pearls as a safety net and repeated the
VxoXfpr6spc,250159,252560,cycle once more once obtaining the 14
VxoXfpr6spc,252560,253760,enter pearls they set off to the
VxoXfpr6spc,253760,255519,stronghold without freeing them and
VxoXfpr6spc,255519,257359,leaving their town in utter shambles
VxoXfpr6spc,257359,259040,unfortunately this was my biggest
VxoXfpr6spc,259040,261040,mistake i left in a rush and did not
VxoXfpr6spc,261040,262880,think of the ruination that lied ahead
VxoXfpr6spc,262880,265040,after walking no more than five minutes
VxoXfpr6spc,265040,266479,i found another village and saw the
VxoXfpr6spc,266479,268240,beauty of a village yet thwarted by a
VxoXfpr6spc,268240,270400,minecraft player i ran swiftly in fear
VxoXfpr6spc,270400,271919,that the villagers would notice and hear
VxoXfpr6spc,271919,273199,word of what happened to their
VxoXfpr6spc,273199,274720,neighboring vill
VxoXfpr6spc,274720,276240,and then i ran back because i passed the
VxoXfpr6spc,276240,278320,portal i mined straight down to finish
VxoXfpr6spc,278320,280560,what i had started but to my surprise i
VxoXfpr6spc,280560,282800,didn't find the stronghold even after it
VxoXfpr6spc,282800,284880,went down in that exact location i
VxoXfpr6spc,284880,286960,started to tower back up desperately to
VxoXfpr6spc,286960,288639,look around a cave system i had mine
VxoXfpr6spc,288639,291280,passed earlier once again nothing at
VxoXfpr6spc,291280,292800,this point i thought strongholds didn't
VxoXfpr6spc,292800,294639,exist at all but then i saw a piece of
VxoXfpr6spc,294639,296400,mossy stone brick sticking out and mined
VxoXfpr6spc,296400,297680,into the stronghold to look for the
VxoXfpr6spc,297680,299759,portal after a brief search i started to
VxoXfpr6spc,299759,302080,run in circles as there were no other
VxoXfpr6spc,302080,304000,paths to take i dug for walls
VxoXfpr6spc,304000,306000,potentially blocking them off but after
VxoXfpr6spc,306000,307840,several minutes it dawned on me there
VxoXfpr6spc,307840,310400,was no end portal having felt defeated i
VxoXfpr6spc,310400,313039,told myself no way after all this time
VxoXfpr6spc,313039,315840,all this effort this is how it ends in a
VxoXfpr6spc,315840,317759,rage i decided to go into creative mode
VxoXfpr6spc,317759,318960,and to blow up the stronghold to
VxoXfpr6spc,318960,320400,hopefully find a portal to prove my
VxoXfpr6spc,320400,321520,theory wrong
VxoXfpr6spc,321520,322320,yet
VxoXfpr6spc,322320,323680,i was right
VxoXfpr6spc,323680,326400,there was no portal at least one that
VxoXfpr6spc,326400,328560,was generated i decided to give myself
VxoXfpr6spc,328560,330560,the final piece in this run and to at
VxoXfpr6spc,330560,332240,least finish what i had started i
VxoXfpr6spc,332240,334000,returned to survival mode and to rest
VxoXfpr6spc,334000,335600,before the big fight
VxoXfpr6spc,335600,337360,i entered each of the eyes of ender into
VxoXfpr6spc,337360,339280,the newly constructed portal and
VxoXfpr6spc,339280,341199,witnessed the portal open
VxoXfpr6spc,341199,343039,in contemplating jumping
VxoXfpr6spc,343039,345520,perhaps this was all a mistake
VxoXfpr6spc,345520,348000,perhaps i had somehow awakened something
VxoXfpr6spc,348000,351039,that was best left to be dormant
VxoXfpr6spc,351039,353039,i spawned on a floating platform and
VxoXfpr6spc,353039,354800,made my way to the end island to see
VxoXfpr6spc,354800,357520,what challenge awaits me upon bridging i
VxoXfpr6spc,357520,359039,remember that the ender dragon perches
VxoXfpr6spc,359039,361039,differently in bedrock to the point that
VxoXfpr6spc,361039,363120,there was a different setup and usage of
VxoXfpr6spc,363120,365520,lava in order to one cycle it therefore
VxoXfpr6spc,365520,367520,i stared at the pillar wishing i had
VxoXfpr6spc,367520,369199,gotten a bow and arrow from the
VxoXfpr6spc,369199,372080,villagers i treated so poorly and thus
VxoXfpr6spc,372080,373410,began the fall
VxoXfpr6spc,373410,374880,[Music]
VxoXfpr6spc,374880,376800,after pillaring up to the first crystal
VxoXfpr6spc,376800,378639,and destroying it i thought to use my
VxoXfpr6spc,378639,380160,ender pearl to get to the next couple of
VxoXfpr6spc,380160,381600,pillars in hopes of clearing the end
VxoXfpr6spc,381600,383680,faster however in this version of
VxoXfpr6spc,383680,385759,minecraft seemingly if you pearl to a
VxoXfpr6spc,385759,387919,crystal you instantly die whereas in
VxoXfpr6spc,387919,389759,java you normally skate away with
VxoXfpr6spc,389759,391759,minimal damage
VxoXfpr6spc,391759,393680,once getting back i bolted around my
VxoXfpr6spc,393680,395680,water bucket that i left behind turns
VxoXfpr6spc,395680,397039,out that the dragon get rid of your
VxoXfpr6spc,397039,398720,water source and destroy your items on
VxoXfpr6spc,398720,401120,the ground with this my only hope of
VxoXfpr6spc,401120,402560,getting to the pillars was by using
VxoXfpr6spc,402560,404720,blocks but without a pickaxe how is that
VxoXfpr6spc,404720,407199,possible well luckily the tnt had left
VxoXfpr6spc,407199,409120,behind a considerable amount of blocks
VxoXfpr6spc,409120,410400,and i grabbed everything from the
VxoXfpr6spc,410400,412240,explosion site to reach the remaining
VxoXfpr6spc,412240,414240,crystals however this dragon was
VxoXfpr6spc,414240,416560,immensely aggressive and even using a
VxoXfpr6spc,416560,418479,new move i have never seen in minecraft
VxoXfpr6spc,418479,419360,before
VxoXfpr6spc,419360,421280,it creates a vortex that does insane
VxoXfpr6spc,421280,423120,tick damage while levitating you up in
VxoXfpr6spc,423120,424080,the air
VxoXfpr6spc,424080,426000,this combined with his new strange
VxoXfpr6spc,426000,428639,patterns and new aggressive nature
VxoXfpr6spc,428639,432319,i kept trying again and again
VxoXfpr6spc,432319,434240,prying my way through the fight with the
VxoXfpr6spc,434240,437199,same strategy but losing my resources
VxoXfpr6spc,437199,438880,every attempt
VxoXfpr6spc,438880,440639,however the same tools constantly
VxoXfpr6spc,440639,442639,survived that being what i began to
VxoXfpr6spc,442639,444720,refer as my sword and my gold helmet
VxoXfpr6spc,444720,447039,which i began to symbolize as my crown
VxoXfpr6spc,447039,448800,due to seeing it as a motivation of
VxoXfpr6spc,448800,450880,sorts and growing more attached to it
VxoXfpr6spc,450880,453039,each time each time i ran out of blocks
VxoXfpr6spc,453039,454880,i'd return to the overworld more beaten
VxoXfpr6spc,454880,456800,up but a growing determination and grit
VxoXfpr6spc,456800,458720,i see whenever i face obstacles in front
VxoXfpr6spc,458720,460720,of my goals mining gravel with my bare
VxoXfpr6spc,460720,462880,hands mining old blocks to further my
VxoXfpr6spc,462880,465680,climbs time and time again
VxoXfpr6spc,465680,468160,until finally all the crystals were gone
VxoXfpr6spc,468160,470000,i threw the last of my items on the
VxoXfpr6spc,470000,471280,ground in order to retrieve them
VxoXfpr6spc,471280,473520,postmortem now it was just me and the
VxoXfpr6spc,473520,477039,dragon with my crown a bed 14 flint
VxoXfpr6spc,477039,479440,three blocks of dirt six torches and my
VxoXfpr6spc,479440,481919,iron sword i knew this was it i fought
VxoXfpr6spc,481919,484639,tirelessly for something i caused once i
VxoXfpr6spc,484639,486560,began to see his health go down a sigh
VxoXfpr6spc,486560,488479,of relief started to overwhelm me
VxoXfpr6spc,488479,490800,however my health bars seemed to do the
VxoXfpr6spc,490800,493520,same thing but much faster then again i
VxoXfpr6spc,493520,495520,was left shocked to my core the ender
VxoXfpr6spc,495520,497280,dragon's health replenishes upon you
VxoXfpr6spc,497280,499280,exiting the dimension even if all the
VxoXfpr6spc,499280,501280,crystals are destroyed the dragon had
VxoXfpr6spc,501280,503520,finally destroyed my crown the object i
VxoXfpr6spc,503520,506160,had clung onto during this process after
VxoXfpr6spc,506160,509120,having no luck i felt defeated yet i
VxoXfpr6spc,509120,511280,knew it wasn't over i wanted to finish
VxoXfpr6spc,511280,512560,what i started
VxoXfpr6spc,512560,514159,reminded of the beauty of the village i
VxoXfpr6spc,514159,515839,had stumbled across i started from
VxoXfpr6spc,515839,518479,square one mine a tree get stone tools
VxoXfpr6spc,518479,520880,and loot a village afterwards i knew
VxoXfpr6spc,520880,522880,that wasn't all i needed this had to be
VxoXfpr6spc,522880,525360,done finished and i had to be prepared
VxoXfpr6spc,525360,527360,this time i mined the resources of the
VxoXfpr6spc,527360,529920,nearby cave for iron tools and armor but
VxoXfpr6spc,529920,532160,kept in my mind the crown i held so
VxoXfpr6spc,532160,534880,dearly that i wish to forge a new one in
VxoXfpr6spc,534880,536720,knowing that this run was soon to be
VxoXfpr6spc,536720,538480,finished and i could finally come out
VxoXfpr6spc,538480,541040,victorious taking one last glimpse as i
VxoXfpr6spc,541040,542480,did the first time
VxoXfpr6spc,542480,544800,jumped into what i now learned
VxoXfpr6spc,544800,547200,the dragon constantly perched time and
VxoXfpr6spc,547200,550000,time again my nerves increasing as i
VxoXfpr6spc,550000,552880,waited to deal the final blow in hopes
VxoXfpr6spc,552880,556480,of the dragon not landing hers and then
VxoXfpr6spc,556480,558480,all of a sudden
VxoXfpr6spc,558480,560880,it was over
VxoXfpr6spc,560880,567279,[Music]
VxoXfpr6spc,567279,568959,and with that
VxoXfpr6spc,568959,570320,the credits rolled
VxoXfpr6spc,570320,573040,at two hours in 16 minutes
VxoXfpr6spc,573040,574000,however
VxoXfpr6spc,574000,575680,there was one last thing that had to be
VxoXfpr6spc,575680,577600,done i wish to thank the villagers that
VxoXfpr6spc,577600,579600,aided me in this quest i returned to the
VxoXfpr6spc,579600,581839,end to claim my trophy went back to the
VxoXfpr6spc,581839,583839,overworld and to return to surface as a
VxoXfpr6spc,583839,585760,victor to the villagers that saw me in
VxoXfpr6spc,585760,587760,shambles i returned all the beds that i
VxoXfpr6spc,587760,589600,had taken protected them from the hust
VxoXfpr6spc,589600,591120,that loomed over them and placed the
VxoXfpr6spc,591120,593519,enderdragon egg on their highest tower
VxoXfpr6spc,593519,594720,and that
VxoXfpr6spc,594720,597040,was the story behind the time i tried to
VxoXfpr6spc,597040,602360,speedrun minecraft education edition
VxoXfpr6spc,604320,620620,[Music]
VxoXfpr6spc,620720,622800,you
vid,start,end,text
VxoXfpr6spc,560,2159,as of recent i have been speedrunning
VxoXfpr6spc,2159,4799,minecraft java edition version 1.16 as a
VxoXfpr6spc,4799,6160,means of mastering a game i've been
VxoXfpr6spc,6160,7839,playing for almost a decade now i have
VxoXfpr6spc,7839,9360,found solace in speedrunning by being
VxoXfpr6spc,9360,10960,able to adapt to your environments and
VxoXfpr6spc,10960,12320,to test your game knowledge as the
VxoXfpr6spc,12320,14240,forefront in improving one's time by no
VxoXfpr6spc,14240,15759,means am i the best speedrunner of all
VxoXfpr6spc,15759,17760,time and have only pb'd at 50 minutes in
VxoXfpr6spc,17760,19520,hopes of getting a sub 30 one day
VxoXfpr6spc,19520,21439,however the other day i was recommended
VxoXfpr6spc,21439,23039,a video that detailed the inner workings
VxoXfpr6spc,23039,24960,of minecraft education edition in which
VxoXfpr6spc,24960,26800,i thought to myself i wonder how speed
VxoXfpr6spc,26800,28400,running minecraft education edition
VxoXfpr6spc,28400,30320,would go and if that's even possible
VxoXfpr6spc,30320,32000,with that thought i downloaded minecraft
VxoXfpr6spc,32000,34239,education edition loaded up a world and
VxoXfpr6spc,34239,36399,set foot on a quest a quest in which i
VxoXfpr6spc,36399,39920,was not aware of what lied ahead
VxoXfpr6spc,40800,42399,so the second that the world started i
VxoXfpr6spc,42399,44160,did the exact same thing as always i
VxoXfpr6spc,44160,46719,mined a tree got stone tools and looted
VxoXfpr6spc,46719,47760,a village
VxoXfpr6spc,47760,49520,and upon reaching that village i began
VxoXfpr6spc,49520,51039,to notice some differences in the game's
VxoXfpr6spc,51039,53120,mechanics opposed to java edition for
VxoXfpr6spc,53120,54719,starters the hoe didn't mind the hay
VxoXfpr6spc,54719,56879,bales at the now buff speeds and my axe
VxoXfpr6spc,56879,58800,crits never had to recharge nor crack
VxoXfpr6spc,58800,61199,the iron golem at this moment i realized
VxoXfpr6spc,61199,62800,that this was the old combat mechanics
VxoXfpr6spc,62800,64239,and that bedrock edition was the source
VxoXfpr6spc,64239,66240,for education edition with his new gain
VxoXfpr6spc,66240,68159,knowledge i set forth looking for a lava
VxoXfpr6spc,68159,69920,pool yet my mind was constantly trying
VxoXfpr6spc,69920,71280,to think of the differences that lied
VxoXfpr6spc,71280,73119,ahead of the run after what felt like
VxoXfpr6spc,73119,75040,forever in speed run terms i found a
VxoXfpr6spc,75040,76640,lava pool that just so happened to be
VxoXfpr6spc,76640,78799,the exact size and lava needed in order
VxoXfpr6spc,78799,80640,to create another portal and upon
VxoXfpr6spc,80640,82560,completion set my spawn point as a
VxoXfpr6spc,82560,84840,precautionary of course and entered the
VxoXfpr6spc,84840,86640,nether
VxoXfpr6spc,86640,88400,and another fortress at the same time
VxoXfpr6spc,88400,90159,the next step in completing this run is
VxoXfpr6spc,90159,92159,obviously to obtain blaze rods in order
VxoXfpr6spc,92159,93920,to create eyes of enders to locate the
VxoXfpr6spc,93920,96640,end portal as time went on my inability
VxoXfpr6spc,96640,98320,to locate a blaze spawner led me to
VxoXfpr6spc,98320,100159,believe that a blaze spawner didn't
VxoXfpr6spc,100159,102159,spawn in another fortress as a means of
VxoXfpr6spc,102159,103680,not letting kids who are at school
VxoXfpr6spc,103680,105759,obviously to beat minecraft when they
VxoXfpr6spc,105759,107360,should be paying attention to a coding
VxoXfpr6spc,107360,109439,lesson fortunately for myself when that
VxoXfpr6spc,109439,110960,thought entered my mind i instantly
VxoXfpr6spc,110960,112560,found a blaze spawner and couldn't have
VxoXfpr6spc,112560,114640,been more relieved that i was wrong yet
VxoXfpr6spc,114640,116479,my troubles only seemed to increase from
VxoXfpr6spc,116479,118719,here you see as i killed the last couple
VxoXfpr6spc,118719,120640,of blazes that i needed i realized what
VxoXfpr6spc,120640,122880,seemed so off from the beginning the hoe
VxoXfpr6spc,122880,124240,didn't seem to mind the hay bale
VxoXfpr6spc,124240,126000,accordingly because it was an older
VxoXfpr6spc,126000,128800,version of minecraft as that sadly sank
VxoXfpr6spc,128800,130479,in i looked around for gold on the
VxoXfpr6spc,130479,132400,ceilings in desperation and the walls of
VxoXfpr6spc,132400,133520,the nether
VxoXfpr6spc,133520,135280,and there was not a single piece of gold
VxoXfpr6spc,135280,138239,to be found 1.16 wasn't in this edition
VxoXfpr6spc,138239,140239,of minecraft my go-to method of
VxoXfpr6spc,140239,142239,speedrunning didn't apply here as there
VxoXfpr6spc,142239,143680,were no means of getting pearls by
VxoXfpr6spc,143680,145440,trading gold with piglens
VxoXfpr6spc,145440,147920,i began to panic and think of a solution
VxoXfpr6spc,147920,150000,as i left another knowing there was
VxoXfpr6spc,150000,151760,nothing left for me there i decided to
VxoXfpr6spc,151760,153680,run in one direction in hopes of finding
VxoXfpr6spc,153680,155280,an enderman to kill in order to make a
VxoXfpr6spc,155280,157280,single eye of ender to at least know the
VxoXfpr6spc,157280,158959,direction i should be running towards
VxoXfpr6spc,158959,160879,the first enderman didn't drop a pearl
VxoXfpr6spc,160879,162319,but instantly afterwards my
VxoXfpr6spc,162319,163920,disappointment was relieved and i found
VxoXfpr6spc,163920,165760,another one and upon killing it it
VxoXfpr6spc,165760,167040,dropped a pearl
VxoXfpr6spc,167040,169440,i created a single eye of ender threw it
VxoXfpr6spc,169440,172560,and then watched it break into pieces
VxoXfpr6spc,172560,173760,soon after heading towards that
VxoXfpr6spc,173760,175280,direction i found a desert and
VxoXfpr6spc,175280,176800,remembered old speed runs involved
VxoXfpr6spc,176800,178720,creating boats sitting in a desert at
VxoXfpr6spc,178720,180400,night and killing endermen in order to
VxoXfpr6spc,180400,182319,obtain pearls i tried this method and
VxoXfpr6spc,182319,184319,had absolutely no luck which i now
VxoXfpr6spc,184319,186319,accredit to the strange occurrences of
VxoXfpr6spc,186319,187920,entities spawning in a chunk by chunk
VxoXfpr6spc,187920,190239,basis which is identical to bedrocks
VxoXfpr6spc,190239,192000,after a grueling walk through the desert
VxoXfpr6spc,192000,194000,i was in between a temple and a savannah
VxoXfpr6spc,194000,195519,village i then realized the method of
VxoXfpr6spc,195519,198000,speedrunning prior to 1.16 was through
VxoXfpr6spc,198000,199840,trading with villagers for emeralds with
VxoXfpr6spc,199840,201840,sticks these sticks were then traded
VxoXfpr6spc,201840,203840,with another villager that gave you
VxoXfpr6spc,203840,205920,pearls i then decided to rate the temple
VxoXfpr6spc,205920,207440,of its resources in hopes of getting
VxoXfpr6spc,207440,209599,better gear and its tnt as well as to
VxoXfpr6spc,209599,211040,sleep right before entering the village
VxoXfpr6spc,211040,213040,to avoid a villager dying to a zombie
VxoXfpr6spc,213040,214319,since i didn't know the process of
VxoXfpr6spc,214319,215920,trading for pearls i looked up a youtube
VxoXfpr6spc,215920,217920,video watched it as i had difficulties
VxoXfpr6spc,217920,219680,corralling villagers accidentally
VxoXfpr6spc,219680,221680,hitting them and the tiresome burden of
VxoXfpr6spc,221680,223120,changing their professions once i
VxoXfpr6spc,223120,224879,managed to start the trading process i
VxoXfpr6spc,224879,226400,realized this process was going to take
VxoXfpr6spc,226400,228720,a long time maybe i did it wrong or
VxoXfpr6spc,228720,230640,should have reset them constantly but i
VxoXfpr6spc,230640,232799,wasn't risking it after being 40 minutes
VxoXfpr6spc,232799,234959,into the run after another 20 minutes of
VxoXfpr6spc,234959,236879,repeating the cycle of trading sticks
VxoXfpr6spc,236879,239120,with villagers getting a pearl
VxoXfpr6spc,239120,241040,destroying their entire life's work
VxoXfpr6spc,241040,242640,wondering why the stupid green villager
VxoXfpr6spc,242640,244720,wouldn't aid me in my quest i finally
VxoXfpr6spc,244720,246560,got the needed 12 ender pearls to finish
VxoXfpr6spc,246560,248480,my run however i wanted more ender
VxoXfpr6spc,248480,250159,pearls as a safety net and repeated the
VxoXfpr6spc,250159,252560,cycle once more once obtaining the 14
VxoXfpr6spc,252560,253760,enter pearls they set off to the
VxoXfpr6spc,253760,255519,stronghold without freeing them and
VxoXfpr6spc,255519,257359,leaving their town in utter shambles
VxoXfpr6spc,257359,259040,unfortunately this was my biggest
VxoXfpr6spc,259040,261040,mistake i left in a rush and did not
VxoXfpr6spc,261040,262880,think of the ruination that lied ahead
VxoXfpr6spc,262880,265040,after walking no more than five minutes
VxoXfpr6spc,265040,266479,i found another village and saw the
VxoXfpr6spc,266479,268240,beauty of a village yet thwarted by a
VxoXfpr6spc,268240,270400,minecraft player i ran swiftly in fear
VxoXfpr6spc,270400,271919,that the villagers would notice and hear
VxoXfpr6spc,271919,273199,word of what happened to their
VxoXfpr6spc,273199,274720,neighboring vill
VxoXfpr6spc,274720,276240,and then i ran back because i passed the
VxoXfpr6spc,276240,278320,portal i mined straight down to finish
VxoXfpr6spc,278320,280560,what i had started but to my surprise i
VxoXfpr6spc,280560,282800,didn't find the stronghold even after it
VxoXfpr6spc,282800,284880,went down in that exact location i
VxoXfpr6spc,284880,286960,started to tower back up desperately to
VxoXfpr6spc,286960,288639,look around a cave system i had mine
VxoXfpr6spc,288639,291280,passed earlier once again nothing at
VxoXfpr6spc,291280,292800,this point i thought strongholds didn't
VxoXfpr6spc,292800,294639,exist at all but then i saw a piece of
VxoXfpr6spc,294639,296400,mossy stone brick sticking out and mined
VxoXfpr6spc,296400,297680,into the stronghold to look for the
VxoXfpr6spc,297680,299759,portal after a brief search i started to
VxoXfpr6spc,299759,302080,run in circles as there were no other
VxoXfpr6spc,302080,304000,paths to take i dug for walls
VxoXfpr6spc,304000,306000,potentially blocking them off but after
VxoXfpr6spc,306000,307840,several minutes it dawned on me there
VxoXfpr6spc,307840,310400,was no end portal having felt defeated i
VxoXfpr6spc,310400,313039,told myself no way after all this time
VxoXfpr6spc,313039,315840,all this effort this is how it ends in a
VxoXfpr6spc,315840,317759,rage i decided to go into creative mode
VxoXfpr6spc,317759,318960,and to blow up the stronghold to
VxoXfpr6spc,318960,320400,hopefully find a portal to prove my
VxoXfpr6spc,320400,321520,theory wrong
VxoXfpr6spc,321520,322320,yet
VxoXfpr6spc,322320,323680,i was right
VxoXfpr6spc,323680,326400,there was no portal at least one that
VxoXfpr6spc,326400,328560,was generated i decided to give myself
VxoXfpr6spc,328560,330560,the final piece in this run and to at
VxoXfpr6spc,330560,332240,least finish what i had started i
VxoXfpr6spc,332240,334000,returned to survival mode and to rest
VxoXfpr6spc,334000,335600,before the big fight
VxoXfpr6spc,335600,337360,i entered each of the eyes of ender into
VxoXfpr6spc,337360,339280,the newly constructed portal and
VxoXfpr6spc,339280,341199,witnessed the portal open
VxoXfpr6spc,341199,343039,in contemplating jumping
VxoXfpr6spc,343039,345520,perhaps this was all a mistake
VxoXfpr6spc,345520,348000,perhaps i had somehow awakened something
VxoXfpr6spc,348000,351039,that was best left to be dormant
VxoXfpr6spc,351039,353039,i spawned on a floating platform and
VxoXfpr6spc,353039,354800,made my way to the end island to see
VxoXfpr6spc,354800,357520,what challenge awaits me upon bridging i
VxoXfpr6spc,357520,359039,remember that the ender dragon perches
VxoXfpr6spc,359039,361039,differently in bedrock to the point that
VxoXfpr6spc,361039,363120,there was a different setup and usage of
VxoXfpr6spc,363120,365520,lava in order to one cycle it therefore
VxoXfpr6spc,365520,367520,i stared at the pillar wishing i had
VxoXfpr6spc,367520,369199,gotten a bow and arrow from the
VxoXfpr6spc,369199,372080,villagers i treated so poorly and thus
VxoXfpr6spc,372080,373410,began the fall
VxoXfpr6spc,373410,374880,[Music]
VxoXfpr6spc,374880,376800,after pillaring up to the first crystal
VxoXfpr6spc,376800,378639,and destroying it i thought to use my
VxoXfpr6spc,378639,380160,ender pearl to get to the next couple of
VxoXfpr6spc,380160,381600,pillars in hopes of clearing the end
VxoXfpr6spc,381600,383680,faster however in this version of
VxoXfpr6spc,383680,385759,minecraft seemingly if you pearl to a
VxoXfpr6spc,385759,387919,crystal you instantly die whereas in
VxoXfpr6spc,387919,389759,java you normally skate away with
VxoXfpr6spc,389759,391759,minimal damage
VxoXfpr6spc,391759,393680,once getting back i bolted around my
VxoXfpr6spc,393680,395680,water bucket that i left behind turns
VxoXfpr6spc,395680,397039,out that the dragon get rid of your
VxoXfpr6spc,397039,398720,water source and destroy your items on
VxoXfpr6spc,398720,401120,the ground with this my only hope of
VxoXfpr6spc,401120,402560,getting to the pillars was by using
VxoXfpr6spc,402560,404720,blocks but without a pickaxe how is that
VxoXfpr6spc,404720,407199,possible well luckily the tnt had left
VxoXfpr6spc,407199,409120,behind a considerable amount of blocks
VxoXfpr6spc,409120,410400,and i grabbed everything from the
VxoXfpr6spc,410400,412240,explosion site to reach the remaining
VxoXfpr6spc,412240,414240,crystals however this dragon was
VxoXfpr6spc,414240,416560,immensely aggressive and even using a
VxoXfpr6spc,416560,418479,new move i have never seen in minecraft
VxoXfpr6spc,418479,419360,before
VxoXfpr6spc,419360,421280,it creates a vortex that does insane
VxoXfpr6spc,421280,423120,tick damage while levitating you up in
VxoXfpr6spc,423120,424080,the air
VxoXfpr6spc,424080,426000,this combined with his new strange
VxoXfpr6spc,426000,428639,patterns and new aggressive nature
VxoXfpr6spc,428639,432319,i kept trying again and again
VxoXfpr6spc,432319,434240,prying my way through the fight with the
VxoXfpr6spc,434240,437199,same strategy but losing my resources
VxoXfpr6spc,437199,438880,every attempt
VxoXfpr6spc,438880,440639,however the same tools constantly
VxoXfpr6spc,440639,442639,survived that being what i began to
VxoXfpr6spc,442639,444720,refer as my sword and my gold helmet
VxoXfpr6spc,444720,447039,which i began to symbolize as my crown
VxoXfpr6spc,447039,448800,due to seeing it as a motivation of
VxoXfpr6spc,448800,450880,sorts and growing more attached to it
VxoXfpr6spc,450880,453039,each time each time i ran out of blocks
VxoXfpr6spc,453039,454880,i'd return to the overworld more beaten
VxoXfpr6spc,454880,456800,up but a growing determination and grit
VxoXfpr6spc,456800,458720,i see whenever i face obstacles in front
VxoXfpr6spc,458720,460720,of my goals mining gravel with my bare
VxoXfpr6spc,460720,462880,hands mining old blocks to further my
VxoXfpr6spc,462880,465680,climbs time and time again
VxoXfpr6spc,465680,468160,until finally all the crystals were gone
VxoXfpr6spc,468160,470000,i threw the last of my items on the
VxoXfpr6spc,470000,471280,ground in order to retrieve them

VxoXfpr6spc,488479,490800,however my health bars seemed to do the
VxoXfpr6spc,490800,493520,same thing but much faster then again i
VxoXfpr6spc,493520,495520,was left shocked to my core the ender

VxoXfpr6spc,497280,499280,exiting the dimension even if all the
VxoXfpr6spc,499280,501280,crystals are destroyed the dragon had
VxoXfpr6spc,501280,503520,finally destroyed my crown the object i
VxoXfpr6spc,503520,506160,had clung onto during this process after
VxoXfpr6spc,506160,509120,having no luck i felt defeated yet i

VxoXfpr6spc,529920,532160,kept in my mind the crown i held so
VxoXfpr6spc,532160,534880,dearly that i wish to forge a new one in
VxoXfpr6spc,534880,536720,knowing that this run was soon to be
VxoXfpr6spc,536720,538480,finished and i could finally come out
