gVUmDZy3DWI,44879,47440,day at pad tier 13 starts with loads of
gVUmDZy3DWI,47440,49680,dough and that is where the similarities

gVUmDZy3DWI,66960,68400,butter
gVUmDZy3DWI,68400,72400,and sent to the walk-in oven

gVUmDZy3DWI,190319,192560,start a perfect samsa casing requires a
gVUmDZy3DWI,192560,194560,thicker middle section and a thinner rim
gVUmDZy3DWI,194560,196560,creating that perfect balance requires a
gVUmDZy3DWI,196560,198159,special rolling pin this is the cutest
gVUmDZy3DWI,198159,199599,rolling pin i've ever seen in my life i

gVUmDZy3DWI,245439,247680,important is the balance it's the
gVUmDZy3DWI,247680,249680,master's eye which can tell that i
gVUmDZy3DWI,249680,251200,should put more meat or i should put

gVUmDZy3DWI,376000,378639,is something
gVUmDZy3DWI,379039,381360,extracting the samsa is the easy part
gVUmDZy3DWI,381360,385360,managing the crowds is another story
gVUmDZy3DWI,386880,388479,it's harder to coordinate than i thought
gVUmDZy3DWI,388479,390000,some people are saying right now hey i
gVUmDZy3DWI,390000,391440,got my ticket i want to go so everyone
gVUmDZy3DWI,391440,393120,wants it fresh out of the oven and it
gVUmDZy3DWI,393120,394639,can't stay in here forever it's like a
gVUmDZy3DWI,394639,396240,limited window of time so he has to
gVUmDZy3DWI,396240,398160,really organize his cooking and his
gVUmDZy3DWI,398160,400720,delivery it's just complete chaos
gVUmDZy3DWI,400720,402639,the more happy patrons that grab their
gVUmDZy3DWI,402639,405199,fresh steaming samsa the closer i am to
gVUmDZy3DWI,405199,407280,tasting one for myself right here we
gVUmDZy3DWI,407280,409599,have two of the kebabs usually kebabs it
gVUmDZy3DWI,409599,411280,will just be put over a grill or
gVUmDZy3DWI,411280,414000,sometimes leaned into a tan door here he
gVUmDZy3DWI,414000,416319,stuffed the kebabs directly on the wall
gVUmDZy3DWI,416319,417840,of this oven so this is the side that
gVUmDZy3DWI,417840,419680,was on the wall it's a little bit more
gVUmDZy3DWI,419680,421440,wet looking and then here there's kind
gVUmDZy3DWI,421440,423280,of a crunchy crust that's developed on
gVUmDZy3DWI,423280,426880,the outside that was facing the fire
gVUmDZy3DWI,428800,430720,it's hot loaded with spices i'm like
gVUmDZy3DWI,430720,432479,what does it care about man it tastes
gVUmDZy3DWI,432479,434319,really different yeah so much seasoning
gVUmDZy3DWI,434319,435840,on there it's interesting because it has
gVUmDZy3DWI,435840,437440,a crust on it but essentially the meat
gVUmDZy3DWI,437440,439440,has kind of steamed this is nice it's
gVUmDZy3DWI,439440,441840,cold outside but it's warm in my belly
gVUmDZy3DWI,441840,443840,since we are standing here i wonder if
gVUmDZy3DWI,443840,445520,we could risk trying one more if you're
gVUmDZy3DWI,445520,447680,feeling so hungry you could eat a horse
gVUmDZy3DWI,447680,450240,sausage this next one is for you okay so
gVUmDZy3DWI,450240,452000,that is like our little horse sausage
gVUmDZy3DWI,452000,454240,burrito you can see how it was hanging
gVUmDZy3DWI,454240,455919,on the wall because the gravity has kind
gVUmDZy3DWI,455919,458400,of pulled it down it's golden brown a
gVUmDZy3DWI,458400,459759,little bit of black stuff but that's
gVUmDZy3DWI,459759,461440,fine and then here the crusty part that
gVUmDZy3DWI,461440,462800,was stuck to the wall oh that's going to
gVUmDZy3DWI,462800,465840,be hot af

gVUmDZy3DWI,471039,472960,above freezing and this is like my hand
gVUmDZy3DWI,472960,474879,warmer and my tummy warmer there's just
gVUmDZy3DWI,474879,477520,so much heat moisture and hot meat in

gVUmDZy3DWI,531360,533040,that's a huge difference actually now i
gVUmDZy3DWI,533040,534800,understand the purpose of the bowl it
gVUmDZy3DWI,534800,537200,contains a liquid more so everything is
gVUmDZy3DWI,537200,538700,extra juicier yeah

gVUmDZy3DWI,543120,544959,lot of oil but it's on contrary it's
gVUmDZy3DWI,544959,546880,like a very clean soup delicious very
gVUmDZy3DWI,546880,548480,rich but i like it to top off the
gVUmDZy3DWI,548480,550480,world's heaviest breakfast the deluxe
gVUmDZy3DWI,550480,552240,samsa
gVUmDZy3DWI,552240,554399,they put everything they could possibly
gVUmDZy3DWI,554399,556320,found and maybe something more cow
gVUmDZy3DWI,556320,558959,tongue chopped beef lamb sausage horse
gVUmDZy3DWI,558959,562480,sausage lamb skirt quail egg pistachios

gVUmDZy3DWI,577040,579839,family right
gVUmDZy3DWI,580880,582720,with the vegetables way different flavor
gVUmDZy3DWI,582720,584480,yeah tastes almost like a stew it's like
gVUmDZy3DWI,584480,586160,when you get grilled chilies and bell
gVUmDZy3DWI,586160,588080,peppers and onions with potatoes it
gVUmDZy3DWI,588080,590399,literally has its own soup it's wild
gVUmDZy3DWI,590399,592399,it's like a liquid in here and it's not
gVUmDZy3DWI,592399,594240,fat it's just the juice of the meat and
gVUmDZy3DWI,594240,595680,the rest of the ingredients i'm blown
gVUmDZy3DWI,595680,597600,away before i came to uzbekistan we had
gVUmDZy3DWI,597600,599040,some on a much different scale there's
gVUmDZy3DWI,599040,601040,like an independent guy doing his own
gVUmDZy3DWI,601040,602880,thing he had a couple ten doors for here
gVUmDZy3DWI,602880,604000,what they're doing here is very
gVUmDZy3DWI,604000,605440,impressive to be able to do pretty
gVUmDZy3DWI,605440,607200,complex food that has to be timed
gVUmDZy3DWI,607200,608640,perfectly and to get it in people's
gVUmDZy3DWI,608640,609920,hands at the perfect time while it's
gVUmDZy3DWI,609920,611279,still hot sometimes should we call it a
gVUmDZy3DWI,611279,614560,day no no man i need a nap after this
gVUmDZy3DWI,614560,616959,the opposite of fire is water but at our
gVUmDZy3DWI,616959,619120,next location i'm more concerned about
gVUmDZy3DWI,619120,621519,what's in the water whoa
gVUmDZy3DWI,621519,623440,this thing is like a snake
gVUmDZy3DWI,623440,625680,whoa
gVUmDZy3DWI,625680,627760,we're standing in front of on a
gVUmDZy3DWI,627760,630160,restaurant offering fresh fish recently
gVUmDZy3DWI,630160,632160,plucked from a nearby river in front of
gVUmDZy3DWI,632160,634880,us a catfish weighing in at over 20
gVUmDZy3DWI,634880,637279,pounds
gVUmDZy3DWI,638320,640800,this is a big boy they usually grow into
gVUmDZy3DWI,640800,642959,like a human size
gVUmDZy3DWI,642959,644880,this thing looks like a giant tadpole as
gVUmDZy3DWI,644880,646240,far as i'm concerned it looks like it's
gVUmDZy3DWI,646240,647839,going to become a big frog one day how
gVUmDZy3DWI,647839,650590,much beer has this fish been drinking
gVUmDZy3DWI,650590,652079,[Music]
gVUmDZy3DWI,652079,654079,this little fatty will be cooked up two
gVUmDZy3DWI,654079,656850,ways kebabs and stewed
gVUmDZy3DWI,656850,659120,[Music]
gVUmDZy3DWI,659120,661279,in this double landlocked country dining
gVUmDZy3DWI,661279,663279,of fresh fish is a treat reserved for
gVUmDZy3DWI,663279,665200,those who make the trip here near the
gVUmDZy3DWI,665200,668160,cerdaria river
gVUmDZy3DWI,668480,670000,if you want to know what's on the menu
gVUmDZy3DWI,670000,671360,just look in the water when you go to
gVUmDZy3DWI,671360,673120,tashkent can you see restaurants like
gVUmDZy3DWI,673120,675120,this with the live fish in front very
gVUmDZy3DWI,675120,676800,seldom yeah you got to keep them on life
gVUmDZy3DWI,676800,678399,support you have to have a defibrillator
gVUmDZy3DWI,678399,682000,all the way to taj can stay alive just
gVUmDZy3DWI,682000,683600,with a huge tank with the water oh
gVUmDZy3DWI,683600,685600,that's a better idea
gVUmDZy3DWI,685600,687600,after the catfish is cleaned it hangs
gVUmDZy3DWI,687600,690399,for a few minutes so the blood can drain
gVUmDZy3DWI,690399,692800,besides catfish carp and whitefish are
gVUmDZy3DWI,692800,694959,also familiar faces at this restaurant
gVUmDZy3DWI,694959,697839,is this one napping
gVUmDZy3DWI,698880,700800,it was freshly caught so it's like now
gVUmDZy3DWI,700800,704399,decompressing but he will adjust
gVUmDZy3DWI,705279,706959,now he's trying to pull it so he wants
gVUmDZy3DWI,706959,708640,you to show that it's still alive quite
gVUmDZy3DWI,708640,710320,unsuccessfully
gVUmDZy3DWI,710320,711519,hey

gVUmDZy3DWI,713040,715440,decompressing it was like i've had quite

gVUmDZy3DWI,728340,728840,[Applause]
gVUmDZy3DWI,728840,730720,[Music]
gVUmDZy3DWI,730720,732399,they season the fish with a blend of
gVUmDZy3DWI,732399,734840,salt paprika parsley and pepper
gVUmDZy3DWI,734840,737040,[Music]

gVUmDZy3DWI,747680,749040,seasoning on there simple
gVUmDZy3DWI,749040,750880,straightforward definitely catfish is
gVUmDZy3DWI,750880,752639,known for the fat so you can feel it's
gVUmDZy3DWI,752639,754480,not a lean it's like fatty and with this
gVUmDZy3DWI,754480,756639,fish you can really taste the minerality
gVUmDZy3DWI,756639,758000,you can taste the river right some
gVUmDZy3DWI,758000,759839,people don't love that riveriness that
gVUmDZy3DWI,759839,761760,minerality but guess what

gVUmDZy3DWI,770639,772720,then here the catfish i think we should
gVUmDZy3DWI,772720,775200,start with this and end with this
gVUmDZy3DWI,775200,777760,the snakehead fish is cleaned scored and
gVUmDZy3DWI,777760,780480,marinated with salt
gVUmDZy3DWI,780480,782480,they deep fry the whole thing until it
gVUmDZy3DWI,782480,785440,looks like modern art
gVUmDZy3DWI,785440,787760,you rip off a little fish steak this
gVUmDZy3DWI,787760,790000,looks nice thin cut extra fried crispy

gVUmDZy3DWI,800639,802320,food you know the trash is greasy this
gVUmDZy3DWI,802320,804320,doesn't taste nearly as rivery as the
gVUmDZy3DWI,804320,805920,catfish it doesn't have that um crazy
gVUmDZy3DWI,805920,807519,kind of mineral taste to it catfish
gVUmDZy3DWI,807519,809279,usually leaves in the bottom like a
gVUmDZy3DWI,809279,811200,spongebob so it ends up eating
gVUmDZy3DWI,811200,812320,everything
gVUmDZy3DWI,812320,814930,would you eat spongebob if you could
gVUmDZy3DWI,814930,818130,[Music]
gVUmDZy3DWI,820079,823440,now this is an epic treat
gVUmDZy3DWI,823440,825519,the catfish meat is deep fried along
gVUmDZy3DWI,825519,827780,with the head
gVUmDZy3DWI,827780,830480,[Music]
gVUmDZy3DWI,830480,832639,in a hazan toss in butter and layer
gVUmDZy3DWI,832639,836800,fried fish meat with herbs and veggies
gVUmDZy3DWI,837440,839360,finish with the head as the cherry on
gVUmDZy3DWI,839360,842360,top
gVUmDZy3DWI,845199,847279,after about 20 minutes the alluring
gVUmDZy3DWI,847279,849440,fragrance escaping the pan will let you
gVUmDZy3DWI,849440,851600,know it's ready
gVUmDZy3DWI,851600,855600,[Music]
gVUmDZy3DWI,855600,856880,i don't even know where to start we have
gVUmDZy3DWI,856880,858240,the head on top but all around it
gVUmDZy3DWI,858240,860000,there's a ton of big pieces of fish i'm
gVUmDZy3DWI,860000,862880,going to try to pull out this meat
gVUmDZy3DWI,862880,864639,i like it a little spongy that's about
gVUmDZy3DWI,864639,866480,spongebob spongy not that level but if
gVUmDZy3DWI,866480,868240,it's spongy way different array of
gVUmDZy3DWI,868240,869839,seasonings and spices here so what we
gVUmDZy3DWI,869839,871440,had already that was grilled much more
gVUmDZy3DWI,871440,873360,simple straightforward this has a much
gVUmDZy3DWI,873360,874720,more depth of flavor to it you want to
gVUmDZy3DWI,874720,877439,try soup yeah
gVUmDZy3DWI,877680,878480,yeah
gVUmDZy3DWI,878480,880160,that's really good beautiful delicious
gVUmDZy3DWI,880160,881519,super thick broth it's starting to warm
gVUmDZy3DWI,881519,883120,me up a little bit imagine putting some
gVUmDZy3DWI,883120,884800,ramen that would be really like a hot
gVUmDZy3DWI,884800,886000,pot
gVUmDZy3DWI,886000,888160,yeah
gVUmDZy3DWI,888160,889120,i'm going to give it a little bit of a
gVUmDZy3DWI,889120,890720,haircut they put all the veggies on here
gVUmDZy3DWI,890720,892320,they've kind of scored the head as well
gVUmDZy3DWI,892320,893920,so it looks a bit gnarly like it got
gVUmDZy3DWI,893920,895519,some prison scarf i'm going to grab just
gVUmDZy3DWI,895519,897680,some cheek meat fish head is prized all
gVUmDZy3DWI,897680,899360,over the world and the most sacred part
gVUmDZy3DWI,899360,902160,is the cheeks
gVUmDZy3DWI,902160,903360,i honestly i couldn't tell the
gVUmDZy3DWI,903360,904720,difference it tastes like just other

gVUmDZy3DWI,905760,907839,more soft not so spongy seasonings have
gVUmDZy3DWI,907839,909199,worked their way into there all right
gVUmDZy3DWI,909199,911120,let's open this mouth
gVUmDZy3DWI,911120,913760,in here we're gonna see a tongue oh

gVUmDZy3DWI,940560,942160,bone marrow maybe your piece did your
gVUmDZy3DWI,942160,943680,piece had a bit more fat than mine so we

gVUmDZy3DWI,190319,192560,start a perfect samsa casing requires a
gVUmDZy3DWI,192560,194560,thicker middle section and a thinner rim
gVUmDZy3DWI,194560,196560,creating that perfect balance requires a
gVUmDZy3DWI,196560,198159,special rolling pin this is the cutest
gVUmDZy3DWI,198159,199599,rolling pin i've ever seen in my life i

gVUmDZy3DWI,242799,245439,obviously fresh ingredients but more
gVUmDZy3DWI,245439,247680,important is the balance it's the
gVUmDZy3DWI,247680,249680,master's eye which can tell that i
gVUmDZy3DWI,249680,251200,should put more meat or i should put

gVUmDZy3DWI,376000,378639,is something
gVUmDZy3DWI,379039,381360,extracting the samsa is the easy part
gVUmDZy3DWI,381360,385360,managing the crowds is another story
gVUmDZy3DWI,386880,388479,it's harder to coordinate than i thought
gVUmDZy3DWI,388479,390000,some people are saying right now hey i
gVUmDZy3DWI,390000,391440,got my ticket i want to go so everyone
gVUmDZy3DWI,391440,393120,wants it fresh out of the oven and it
gVUmDZy3DWI,393120,394639,can't stay in here forever it's like a
gVUmDZy3DWI,394639,396240,limited window of time so he has to
gVUmDZy3DWI,396240,398160,really organize his cooking and his
gVUmDZy3DWI,398160,400720,delivery it's just complete chaos
gVUmDZy3DWI,400720,402639,the more happy patrons that grab their
gVUmDZy3DWI,402639,405199,fresh steaming samsa the closer i am to
gVUmDZy3DWI,405199,407280,tasting one for myself right here we
gVUmDZy3DWI,407280,409599,have two of the kebabs usually kebabs it
gVUmDZy3DWI,409599,411280,will just be put over a grill or
gVUmDZy3DWI,411280,414000,sometimes leaned into a tan door here he
gVUmDZy3DWI,414000,416319,stuffed the kebabs directly on the wall
gVUmDZy3DWI,416319,417840,of this oven so this is the side that
gVUmDZy3DWI,417840,419680,was on the wall it's a little bit more
gVUmDZy3DWI,419680,421440,wet looking and then here there's kind
gVUmDZy3DWI,421440,423280,of a crunchy crust that's developed on
gVUmDZy3DWI,423280,426880,the outside that was facing the fire
gVUmDZy3DWI,428800,430720,it's hot loaded with spices i'm like
gVUmDZy3DWI,430720,432479,what does it care about man it tastes
gVUmDZy3DWI,432479,434319,really different yeah so much seasoning
gVUmDZy3DWI,434319,435840,on there it's interesting because it has
gVUmDZy3DWI,435840,437440,a crust on it but essentially the meat
gVUmDZy3DWI,437440,439440,has kind of steamed this is nice it's
gVUmDZy3DWI,439440,441840,cold outside but it's warm in my belly
gVUmDZy3DWI,441840,443840,since we are standing here i wonder if
gVUmDZy3DWI,443840,445520,we could risk trying one more if you're
gVUmDZy3DWI,445520,447680,feeling so hungry you could eat a horse
gVUmDZy3DWI,447680,450240,sausage this next one is for you okay so
gVUmDZy3DWI,450240,452000,that is like our little horse sausage
gVUmDZy3DWI,452000,454240,burrito you can see how it was hanging
gVUmDZy3DWI,454240,455919,on the wall because the gravity has kind
gVUmDZy3DWI,455919,458400,of pulled it down it's golden brown a
gVUmDZy3DWI,458400,459759,little bit of black stuff but that's
gVUmDZy3DWI,459759,461440,fine and then here the crusty part that
gVUmDZy3DWI,461440,462800,was stuck to the wall oh that's going to
gVUmDZy3DWI,462800,465840,be hot af

gVUmDZy3DWI,467280,468800,man there's nowhere i'd rather be right
gVUmDZy3DWI,468800,471039,now it's about 40 degrees outside just
gVUmDZy3DWI,471039,472960,above freezing and this is like my hand
gVUmDZy3DWI,472960,474879,warmer and my tummy warmer there's just
gVUmDZy3DWI,474879,477520,so much heat moisture and hot meat in

gVUmDZy3DWI,531360,533040,that's a huge difference actually now i
gVUmDZy3DWI,533040,534800,understand the purpose of the bowl it
gVUmDZy3DWI,534800,537200,contains a liquid more so everything is

gVUmDZy3DWI,543120,544959,lot of oil but it's on contrary it's
gVUmDZy3DWI,544959,546880,like a very clean soup delicious very
gVUmDZy3DWI,546880,548480,rich but i like it to top off the
gVUmDZy3DWI,548480,550480,world's heaviest breakfast the deluxe
gVUmDZy3DWI,550480,552240,samsa
gVUmDZy3DWI,552240,554399,they put everything they could possibly
gVUmDZy3DWI,554399,556320,found and maybe something more cow

gVUmDZy3DWI,580880,582720,with the vegetables way different flavor
gVUmDZy3DWI,582720,584480,yeah tastes almost like a stew it's like
gVUmDZy3DWI,584480,586160,when you get grilled chilies and bell
gVUmDZy3DWI,586160,588080,peppers and onions with potatoes it

gVUmDZy3DWI,590399,592399,it's like a liquid in here and it's not
gVUmDZy3DWI,592399,594240,fat it's just the juice of the meat and
gVUmDZy3DWI,594240,595680,the rest of the ingredients i'm blown
gVUmDZy3DWI,595680,597600,away before i came to uzbekistan we had
gVUmDZy3DWI,597600,599040,some on a much different scale there's
gVUmDZy3DWI,599040,601040,like an independent guy doing his own
gVUmDZy3DWI,601040,602880,thing he had a couple ten doors for here
gVUmDZy3DWI,602880,604000,what they're doing here is very
gVUmDZy3DWI,604000,605440,impressive to be able to do pretty
gVUmDZy3DWI,605440,607200,complex food that has to be timed
gVUmDZy3DWI,607200,608640,perfectly and to get it in people's
gVUmDZy3DWI,608640,609920,hands at the perfect time while it's
gVUmDZy3DWI,609920,611279,still hot sometimes should we call it a
gVUmDZy3DWI,611279,614560,day no no man i need a nap after this
gVUmDZy3DWI,614560,616959,the opposite of fire is water but at our
gVUmDZy3DWI,616959,619120,next location i'm more concerned about
gVUmDZy3DWI,619120,621519,what's in the water whoa
gVUmDZy3DWI,621519,623440,this thing is like a snake
gVUmDZy3DWI,623440,625680,whoa
gVUmDZy3DWI,625680,627760,we're standing in front of on a
gVUmDZy3DWI,627760,630160,restaurant offering fresh fish recently
gVUmDZy3DWI,630160,632160,plucked from a nearby river in front of
gVUmDZy3DWI,632160,634880,us a catfish weighing in at over 20
gVUmDZy3DWI,634880,637279,pounds
gVUmDZy3DWI,638320,640800,this is a big boy they usually grow into
gVUmDZy3DWI,640800,642959,like a human size
gVUmDZy3DWI,642959,644880,this thing looks like a giant tadpole as
gVUmDZy3DWI,644880,646240,far as i'm concerned it looks like it's
gVUmDZy3DWI,646240,647839,going to become a big frog one day how
gVUmDZy3DWI,647839,650590,much beer has this fish been drinking
gVUmDZy3DWI,650590,652079,[Music]
gVUmDZy3DWI,652079,654079,this little fatty will be cooked up two
gVUmDZy3DWI,654079,656850,ways kebabs and stewed
gVUmDZy3DWI,656850,659120,[Music]

gVUmDZy3DWI,675120,676800,seldom yeah you got to keep them on life
gVUmDZy3DWI,676800,678399,support you have to have a defibrillator
gVUmDZy3DWI,678399,682000,all the way to taj can stay alive just
gVUmDZy3DWI,682000,683600,with a huge tank with the water oh
gVUmDZy3DWI,683600,685600,that's a better idea
gVUmDZy3DWI,685600,687600,after the catfish is cleaned it hangs
gVUmDZy3DWI,687600,690399,for a few minutes so the blood can drain
gVUmDZy3DWI,690399,692800,besides catfish carp and whitefish are
gVUmDZy3DWI,692800,694959,also familiar faces at this restaurant

gVUmDZy3DWI,698880,700800,it was freshly caught so it's like now
gVUmDZy3DWI,700800,704399,decompressing but he will adjust
gVUmDZy3DWI,705279,706959,now he's trying to pull it so he wants
gVUmDZy3DWI,706959,708640,you to show that it's still alive quite

gVUmDZy3DWI,775200,777760,the snakehead fish is cleaned scored and
gVUmDZy3DWI,777760,780480,marinated with salt
gVUmDZy3DWI,780480,782480,they deep fry the whole thing until it

gVUmDZy3DWI,802320,804320,doesn't taste nearly as rivery as the
gVUmDZy3DWI,804320,805920,catfish it doesn't have that um crazy
gVUmDZy3DWI,805920,807519,kind of mineral taste to it catfish
gVUmDZy3DWI,807519,809279,usually leaves in the bottom like a
gVUmDZy3DWI,809279,811200,spongebob so it ends up eating
gVUmDZy3DWI,811200,812320,everything

gVUmDZy3DWI,825519,827780,with the head
gVUmDZy3DWI,827780,830480,[Music]
gVUmDZy3DWI,830480,832639,in a hazan toss in butter and layer

gVUmDZy3DWI,839360,842360,top
gVUmDZy3DWI,845199,847279,after about 20 minutes the alluring
gVUmDZy3DWI,847279,849440,fragrance escaping the pan will let you
gVUmDZy3DWI,849440,851600,know it's ready
gVUmDZy3DWI,851600,855600,[Music]
gVUmDZy3DWI,855600,856880,i don't even know where to start we have
gVUmDZy3DWI,856880,858240,the head on top but all around it
gVUmDZy3DWI,858240,860000,there's a ton of big pieces of fish i'm
gVUmDZy3DWI,860000,862880,going to try to pull out this meat
gVUmDZy3DWI,862880,864639,i like it a little spongy that's about
gVUmDZy3DWI,864639,866480,spongebob spongy not that level but if
gVUmDZy3DWI,866480,868240,it's spongy way different array of
gVUmDZy3DWI,868240,869839,seasonings and spices here so what we
gVUmDZy3DWI,869839,871440,had already that was grilled much more
gVUmDZy3DWI,871440,873360,simple straightforward this has a much
gVUmDZy3DWI,873360,874720,more depth of flavor to it you want to
gVUmDZy3DWI,874720,877439,try soup yeah

gVUmDZy3DWI,878480,880160,that's really good beautiful delicious
gVUmDZy3DWI,880160,881519,super thick broth it's starting to warm
gVUmDZy3DWI,881519,883120,me up a little bit imagine putting some
gVUmDZy3DWI,883120,884800,ramen that would be really like a hot
gVUmDZy3DWI,884800,886000,pot
gVUmDZy3DWI,886000,888160,yeah
gVUmDZy3DWI,888160,889120,i'm going to give it a little bit of a
gVUmDZy3DWI,889120,890720,haircut they put all the veggies on here
gVUmDZy3DWI,890720,892320,they've kind of scored the head as well
gVUmDZy3DWI,892320,893920,so it looks a bit gnarly like it got
gVUmDZy3DWI,893920,895519,some prison scarf i'm going to grab just
gVUmDZy3DWI,895519,897680,some cheek meat fish head is prized all
gVUmDZy3DWI,897680,899360,over the world and the most sacred part

gVUmDZy3DWI,903360,904720,difference it tastes like just other

gVUmDZy3DWI,907839,909199,worked their way into there all right
