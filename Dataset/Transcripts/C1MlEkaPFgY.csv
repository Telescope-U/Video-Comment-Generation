C1MlEkaPFgY,4770,12111,"I am going to be hosting a huge art competition show  - and the winner literally   will win $100,000. - What?"
C1MlEkaPFgY,12144,17350," But in order to win,  they will have to be  up for the challenge.  - I hope everyone   likes push-ups. - Oh, man."
C1MlEkaPFgY,17383,24657, And when I say challenge...  - All: Whoa! - ...I mean it.  Each of you will be customizing electric vehicles.
C1MlEkaPFgY,24690,31464,"- Oh, my God. - Wow.  - This is insane, Zach. - What is that?   I'm going to push these  artists to their limits."
C1MlEkaPFgY,31497,36669,This is so heavy.   Some will succeed.  This is so good!   Some won't.
C1MlEkaPFgY,36702,42675,"Oh, my God.  - Some...  - Aah! Oh, my God!  - ...might break.  - I'm freaking out."
C1MlEkaPFgY,42708,45412," Wait, wait, wait, stop.  Editors, let's not get  ahead of ourselves."
C1MlEkaPFgY,48314,55188,Wait. I'm starting to get kind of nervous.   Some of you may have seen  my videos before.  - Yay! - But for those of you  who haven't...
C1MlEkaPFgY,55221,62528,This is my first YouTube video.   I started making videos  in my bedroom back in 2016.  This bed was part of my first video.
C1MlEkaPFgY,62561,68201,"- Have you guys seen it? - Yes!  It was mediocre.   At the time, I only had  a few subscribers."
C1MlEkaPFgY,68234,74541," But I knew I wanted  to make more videos  and build my channel.  We're going to be drawing until we hit 500,000 subscribers, which is insane."
C1MlEkaPFgY,75875,82248," It wasn't easy,  but I kept at it.   The videos got bigger.  I'm going to customize this entire school."
C1MlEkaPFgY,82281,88387,- The collaborations  got bigger.  - Subscribe to ZHC.   And now it's up to me to find  the next art influencer.
C1MlEkaPFgY,88420,95895,"- Nice. - What is up everyone?   This is my official audition.   I asked all of you  to send an audition tape  to be on the show,"
C1MlEkaPFgY,95928,101299," and immediately I had to sort  through lots of video.  I'm from Long Island, New York.  People call me JB."
C1MlEkaPFgY,101333,106672,"Just reached 1,000 subscribers.   And I found 10 artists  who have the artistic  talent and personality"
C1MlEkaPFgY,106705,111878,"- I was looking for  to take on the challenge.  - Aah!  - Boo! - Ahh!  Guess what. You're going to be on ""Instant Influencer."""
C1MlEkaPFgY,111911,119352,"- No! - Oh, my gosh. This is crazy.   Joining me on this  journey will be my cohost  Dayna Isom Johnson."
C1MlEkaPFgY,119385,124490,"You're going to have to paint underneath the bed.  - She, along with other  special guests...  - ( shouting )"
C1MlEkaPFgY,124523,129595,"- Hi, Zach. - ...will tell me  what they think.  You're killing it. Man, Zach, that's going to be tough on you."
C1MlEkaPFgY,129628,135334," But in the end,  the decision will be mine.  ( door opening )"
C1MlEkaPFgY,135367,141440," There will be one winner who  will walk home with $100,000   and become the next  instant influencer."
C1MlEkaPFgY,141473,149349,"- Yes! - That is it.  This is ""Instant Influencer With ZHC."""
C1MlEkaPFgY,152751,157957,"Hi, I'm Tyler. I'm from Chicago, Illinois, and I do art with hair."
C1MlEkaPFgY,157990,163930,"My art style is extremely unique, and it is 3-D hair art."
C1MlEkaPFgY,163963,171771,"My goal is truly to allow other black women to see my art  and feel better about themselves, and I want everyone to come to my page"
C1MlEkaPFgY,171804,181814,and take something positive and impactful with them.  I got into this influencing role completely 150 billion percent on accident.
C1MlEkaPFgY,181847,188888,"I started posting videos so I can go back and be like, ""Oh, JB, that was dope.""  I woke up with over a million views."
C1MlEkaPFgY,188921,195827,I work at a law firm now. The reason why I really started law  was because I wanted to help out people who look like me.
C1MlEkaPFgY,195861,203569,"With art, I want to do the same exact thing.  I'm definitely going to one hundred and fifty billion percent kill it."
C1MlEkaPFgY,203602,210376,My name's Jadon. I just got out of high school. I live with my parents.  I'm giving myself one year to make it as an influencer.
C1MlEkaPFgY,210409,216515,"We are customizing a projector. Boxing gear. Crocs.  All I want to do is customize, all day, every day."
C1MlEkaPFgY,216548,222955,"If I won the $100,000, I would buy a warehouse and customize everything in it.  I've been an athlete my whole life,"
C1MlEkaPFgY,222988,229962,"I'm super competitive, and I'm definitely here to win.  - Oh! - Gosh!"
C1MlEkaPFgY,229995,236535,- What? - Wow.  This is everything!  It feels really amazing to be here.
C1MlEkaPFgY,236568,243643,"I never would've thought I'd end up somewhere like this.  - Yes! - Look at that.  - No! It's so sick. - Oh, shoot."
C1MlEkaPFgY,243676,250750,"- That's a little-- - No way.  It feels like I was just sitting in my house,  and now I'm here filming a show."
C1MlEkaPFgY,250783,257889,"Get my good side, y'all.  - Hey! - Hello."
C1MlEkaPFgY,257923,264930,"- Oh, what's up? - The man himself.  Hi, artists. I'm ZHC, but since we're now all best friends, you can call me Zach."
C1MlEkaPFgY,264963,271703,"- Hey, Zach! - Let's go.  Over the next few weeks, I'm going to be putting you guys through multiple challenges."
C1MlEkaPFgY,271737,280446,"It's going to be fun. It'll be hard. And I mean, really hard.  - Oh, my God. - When it's all over,   one of you will win $100,000,"
C1MlEkaPFgY,280479,286652,"and a chance to do a collaboration video with me,  and become an instant influencer.  - All: Yeah. - Let's go."
C1MlEkaPFgY,286685,293725,"It all starts right now.  - What is that? - Oh, man."
C1MlEkaPFgY,293759,299632,Are we in a cage?  - Ta-da. Come on. - Okay.  What is that?
C1MlEkaPFgY,299665,305938,"- Oh, my. - What are we doing?  - Oh, my God. - This is a lot of stuff.  - It's like a yard sale. - All right. I'm locking   you guys in now."
C1MlEkaPFgY,305971,312445,"Wait, what?  - Hope you guys said   your goodbyes already. - Oh, no.  - Oh, he's like actually   locking us in. - Help us."
C1MlEkaPFgY,312478,317949,"I literally just got here and they're locking us in a cage.  Like, wasn't expecting that."
C1MlEkaPFgY,317983,325857,"Hope you went to the bathroom already.  Girl, I don't even know.  Before I tell you what the challenge is, I want to introduce you to my cohost."
C1MlEkaPFgY,325891,331496,Dayna Isom Johnson.  ( cheering ) 
C1MlEkaPFgY,331530,336634,"- Howdy. - Hi, artists.  - All: Hi. - Dayna's the trend   expert for Etsy"
C1MlEkaPFgY,336668,341774,"and a judge on ""Making It.""  She's going to be here all season  hanging out with us, looking at your art,"
C1MlEkaPFgY,341807,347947,"and most importantly,  talking about them behind their backs.  Mm-hmm. Yup, that's right."
C1MlEkaPFgY,347980,353919,"For the first challenge, we're going to lock you in here for the next four hours.  - Ooh. - Four hours."
C1MlEkaPFgY,353952,362495,"Zach, girl.  Here's the deal, if you want to be an art influencer,  you have to get used to the whole world watching you."
C1MlEkaPFgY,362528,371871,"So the theme of this challenge is ""All Eyes On You.""  You're going to have to create a fence mural using that pile of up-cycled junk."
C1MlEkaPFgY,371904,378778,"Using up-cycled junk is a hot trend right now,  and it's also better for the environment."
C1MlEkaPFgY,378811,385684,"You may notice that there are actually five sides to work on, but there are ten of you.  - What? - That's because for   your first challenge,"
C1MlEkaPFgY,385717,392691,you are going to work in teams of two whether you like it or not.  Partners? Nobody told me this.
C1MlEkaPFgY,392724,399632,"Inside that pile, you're going to find pairs of aprons that are all tied together.  That's how you're going to find your team."
C1MlEkaPFgY,399665,405905,"Like this? We got to dig through?  Zach: I'm looking for creativity, technique, as well as teamwork."
C1MlEkaPFgY,405938,412945,And speaking of teamwork...  ...the bottom team will be going home.
C1MlEkaPFgY,412978,419918,"Double elimination.  Oh, man. I was not expecting that.  All right. Your four hours starts now."
C1MlEkaPFgY,419952,426559,"- Okay, cool. - Okay.  - So... - Wait, wait. How do you?  - Kirsten and Jadon. - Oh, that's me."
C1MlEkaPFgY,426592,431897,"- Sophie, I found yours.   You're with Joseph. - Joseph.  I wonder if any of them are going to be upset with their teammates."
C1MlEkaPFgY,431930,438504,"- Ooh! - Yes, bitch!  - Let's go. - JB pulls out mine  because I'm incapable of finding anything."
C1MlEkaPFgY,438537,446579,"- It's going to look like   I'm wearing no pants. - Yes, I know!  Hi, I'm David, and I make the most magical colorful art you will ever see."
C1MlEkaPFgY,446612,452151,"I'm currently in art school, but cannot wait to get out  and do my own magical crazy thing, like this and like this."
C1MlEkaPFgY,452184,459824,"Growing up in Ohio, I've gotten a lot of ( clang )  for who I am and who I choose to love,  so I like to use my art to advocate for that and to help younger people"
C1MlEkaPFgY,459858,467233,who might be going through a similar thing.  What was your original idea?  My idea was to have a cup eye in the center made out of a cup.
C1MlEkaPFgY,467266,473606,"- That's what I want to do. - You literally want to do that?  - Yeah, yeah,   that's what I'm saying. - No! Okay. Okay.  - All right. We got it. - So I want an eye   in the center."
C1MlEkaPFgY,473639,482581,"- Yeah. - Like the eye of the storm.  - And around it it's, like,   a garbage trash storm. - Okay.  - And I can make these giant rose flowers that look cool. - Yeah."
C1MlEkaPFgY,482614,487785,"- I'm totally wearing   this wrong, right? - No, you're good.  All right, pencil for you, pencil for me.  Thank you. Here's your sketchbook."
C1MlEkaPFgY,487819,494793,"Okay, my idea was just to do a celestial type of thing.  - We add cool clouds   and planets and things. - I agree. I agree."
C1MlEkaPFgY,494826,500966,"Like, a sun and a moon type of thing.  - I had one like that, too. - Okay, so then--  - Let's just do that. - Okay."
C1MlEkaPFgY,500999,507172,Ahh!  - Okay. - I got to get   one other thing.
C1MlEkaPFgY,507205,512610,- I want to grab   this whole thing. - I know. I want everything.  I feel like everyone's going to do a big eye.  Everybody's gonna do a big eye.
C1MlEkaPFgY,512643,518617,So I feel like we need a story.  That's a really good idea.  So I was thinking if we could do a face or something.  - Okay. - With a nice lash.
C1MlEkaPFgY,518650,524290,"- Profile? - Yes. That's what   I was thinking.  - Okay. - Well, I typically add   real hair to my artwork,  - Okay. - So I figure that could   be a really cool element,"
C1MlEkaPFgY,524323,530595,- with string or some   sort of long material. - Yarn or something?  And I could braid it up and do something really dope that way.  - Okay. - So let's get   into this outline.
C1MlEkaPFgY,530629,536101,"Yes.  - Where you from? - I am from Sacramento, California."
C1MlEkaPFgY,536134,544276,"- Hey! - And now I live here with   my wife and our four boys.  - Oh, wow. Boy dad. - Yes.  Hey, what's up. I'm Ryan Murray. I'm a father of four crazy boys."
C1MlEkaPFgY,544309,551717,"All: Hi, Zach and team.  So if I had to tell you how many times we watch ZHC during the week? Um..."
C1MlEkaPFgY,551750,559191,"I probably can't keep track. It's so many.  So it means everything to me to be on ""Instant Influencer,""  and to be honest, my kids are going to think I'm a superhero."
C1MlEkaPFgY,566798,572003,"- We didn't even really   get to know each other. - I know.  - But what type of artwork   do you usually do? - I usually do 3-D work,"
C1MlEkaPFgY,572037,578310,"- and 3-D printing stuff. - Oh, that's cool. Okay.  The art I enjoy doing the most right now is 3-D design."
C1MlEkaPFgY,578343,583649,I just like to take objects that are kind of boring and put my own spin on it.  Here we have the keyboard farm.
C1MlEkaPFgY,583682,590155,"( bleating )  I've lived all over the world.  Because I moved around a lot, my friends came from YouTube,"
C1MlEkaPFgY,590188,597196,"and then when I started getting more serious about my art,  that's what my channel really became about.  It became a real community."
C1MlEkaPFgY,597229,605204,"I'm like complete opposite. I'm an old school acrylic painter.  So, I think that would be perfect to work together."
C1MlEkaPFgY,605237,610209,"- Yeah. - I first moved out to Los Angeles to become a model,   but it wasn't where  my passion was."
C1MlEkaPFgY,610242,617116,"So I decided to shift into painting, which was the best idea ever.   From the age of three,  I can remember myself having  my hands covered in paint,"
C1MlEkaPFgY,617149,622688,putting my handprints on the wall.  My apartment at home is becoming a little art gallery as well.
C1MlEkaPFgY,622721,628294," My bedroom, my friend's room,  the living room,  even the bathroom--   not to mention all the ones  I have stored in my closet."
C1MlEkaPFgY,632197,638971,"- So what kind of stuff   do you normally do? - I customize shoes.  - Nice. - Kind of what ZHC does.  I customize literally everything now, so..."
C1MlEkaPFgY,639004,645076,"Yeah. See, that's the one thing that I don't do. I don't really customize stuff.  I make the illustrations for people."
C1MlEkaPFgY,645110,650149,I do all my stuff on my iPad. I'm a digital artist.  - That's what I do. - Must be nice.
C1MlEkaPFgY,650182,657056,"Yeah, it really is because you've got the back button.  My name is Kirsten, I'm 18 years old, and I'm your country bumpkin."
C1MlEkaPFgY,657089,663762,So cute. Look at him. My backyard is literally an entire forest.  I go kayaking and fishing a lot.
C1MlEkaPFgY,663795,671102,"ZHC, I think he's pretty rad,  doing things that I would like to do, you know?  - Hi! - Like, have a YouTube Channel with all my friends."
C1MlEkaPFgY,671136,677109,"Oh, they're super rad. Ashlyn, Maya, Mon, Abby, Tiana, and Josh.  ( laughing )"
C1MlEkaPFgY,677142,682848,"They're a lot of fun.  Okay, we've got to move this space. I've got everything here."
C1MlEkaPFgY,682881,689154,"Move this.  - Aah! - Oh, I'm so sorry.  No, I'm being dramatic, come on."
C1MlEkaPFgY,689187,696161,"You work in a messy space, too, no?  Yeah, I'm always like a mess.  What do you do if it's not art?  I work as a computer scientist,"
C1MlEkaPFgY,696194,701266,"but I don't really like it, so...  I never really considered myself someone who was an artist."
C1MlEkaPFgY,701299,706338,"I just considered myself a person who does art, if that makes sense?"
C1MlEkaPFgY,706371,713212,I'm currently a computer scientist and things are often very logical  and straight-forward to me. Art is very subjective.
C1MlEkaPFgY,713245,721220,"Things can look good to someone and not good to another person.  If by some luck I happen to win this thing,"
C1MlEkaPFgY,721253,724890,maybe someday I'll actually be able to call myself a real artist.
C1MlEkaPFgY,727125,732530,"Right now, it's going to probably look crazy, but I think it'll come together.  - Yeah. - That's how my art works   on the whole."
C1MlEkaPFgY,732564,740037,"- It looks terrible,   until it looks-- - It looks--  Yeah, I just want to quit the second I start trying it.  Once I stick with it, it ends up looking pretty good."
C1MlEkaPFgY,740071,745410,"I think the first time in high school when I drew a superhero,  I was like, this was way better than I thought it was going to be,"
C1MlEkaPFgY,745443,752884,even though it was probably crap at the time.  Can I say crap? Yeah? Okay.  So that really just motivated me to keep getting better and better.
C1MlEkaPFgY,752918,759525,"I started watching ZHC and just seeing how he gives back  is everything I've always wanted to do, so that really got me into the influencer field."
C1MlEkaPFgY,759558,766298,"And I just love to be able to give back to the people who are already supporting me.  Oh, JB, tape has to stick."
C1MlEkaPFgY,766331,772503,"Whew! I gotta stand up.  - Hello! - Hey.  How are you all doing?  If you want to help us, that'd be great."
C1MlEkaPFgY,772537,778443,I don't think I'm allowed to.  But I do have something that can help you right now.
C1MlEkaPFgY,778476,784817,These are called put-in cups.  These are actually really useful because they fit right in these fences.
C1MlEkaPFgY,784850,791089,"And you just got to take one and shove it in, so they'll really help you.  - Yes. - Yes.  But only one team can get them."
C1MlEkaPFgY,791122,797262,"All right, what do I got to do?  Say hello to my little friends.  - Hey, friends. - Hello, little-- oh, no!"
C1MlEkaPFgY,797295,804069,"Whichever team rolls the highest number gets the put-in cups.  - Okay. - Come on, Marissa.  Oh, that's a nine."
C1MlEkaPFgY,804102,807406,"Kirsten and Jadon: Aww!  - Go. - Get into it, baby!  Nope, sorry."
C1MlEkaPFgY,809608,816181,"- I said the highest number. - And...  - No, no, no. - Oh, nice!"
C1MlEkaPFgY,816214,822120,"Whoa!  Sophie, Joseph, there you go."
C1MlEkaPFgY,822153,827459,"- Thank you. - Enjoy your put-in cups.  Oh, my God. This is so messy."
C1MlEkaPFgY,827492,834365,"I'm always a mess, so just like--  I think we got paired  for a reason...  - Yeah, pretty much. - ...because I'm a disaster."
C1MlEkaPFgY,834399,841139,"How you feeling on time? Do you think we need to pick it up a little bit?  I think we're doing really good on time, especially for being people--  I'm not very good at time management usually."
C1MlEkaPFgY,841172,848412,"- Yeah, me neither.   I just go for it. - So I think this is dope.  - I say let's do   another hour for eyes. - Yeah.   - And an hour for background. - Yes."
C1MlEkaPFgY,848446,854219,"It feels like I've known JB for forever and I just met her.  She's incredible, and I don't know how the other teams are working together,"
C1MlEkaPFgY,854252,860492,but I feel like we got this in the bag.  - All right.   Continue with this... - Okay.  ...and I'm going to get started on the eyes.
C1MlEkaPFgY,865530,871169,"After we're done with the umbrella, and I get done with the eyeballs,  I'll make the handle out of something. I don't know what yet,"
C1MlEkaPFgY,871202,877242,"- but we'll work it out. - And honestly, dude,   we have plenty of time.  We got it. Working as a team."
C1MlEkaPFgY,877275,885350,"I'm totally confident in Jadon's plan.  I feel like it's going to be okay.  Okay, after we get the sun and the clouds down,"
C1MlEkaPFgY,885383,891623,"- doing little planets and   stuff will be pretty easy. - Yeah.  Because there's like plates and stuff, they're already shaped as."
C1MlEkaPFgY,894693,898931,"Marissa, how long does it take you to do a flower?  - Uh, like 30 minutes? - Okay."
C1MlEkaPFgY,907405,913245,All right. This one's done. What do you think?  Let me see. Beautiful. Beautiful. It's really nice.
C1MlEkaPFgY,913278,921553,"- So if we put one, like... - Yes.  - Killing it, Marissa. - Thank you.  Oh, my God. Why am I sweating so much? This is weird."
C1MlEkaPFgY,921586,925624,Who turned up the heat? Why am I sweating so much? Why is it so hot?
C1MlEkaPFgY,929194,935067,"I did not anticipate being this sweaty.  Joseph, you're really breaking a sweat."
C1MlEkaPFgY,935100,942673,"- He is. - Yeah, I didn't realize   it'd be this hot.  Is it the heat or is it the pressure?  It's a little bit of both, but, you know, you work through it."
C1MlEkaPFgY,942707,949982,"Are these clouds we're looking at?  - Yes. - We're going with a sky, celestial, spacey theme."
C1MlEkaPFgY,950015,956722,"Solar systems. And then everything's going to be revolving around the sun,  because all eyes on the sun. It's the center of everything."
C1MlEkaPFgY,956755,962327,"- Wait, don't your eyes get   hurt if you stare at the sun? - That's true."
C1MlEkaPFgY,962360,968066,"- Hey, y'all. - Both: Hey!  - What's going on here? - Oh, we're killing it.  Yeah, we're destroying the game right now."
C1MlEkaPFgY,968099,973171,- Was it a rainbow butterfly? - Yeah.  - Yes. - Whoa.  Why a butterfly? What does it mean to you?
C1MlEkaPFgY,973204,980345,"You know how butterflies have those eye patterns?  I wanted to do something to kind of represent that.  So, incorporating the eye, but in a way that's not--"
C1MlEkaPFgY,980378,987586,"Dayna: Like a monarch butterfly type dot situation.  - I have a very   interesting question. - Oh, no.  Which team do you think is getting eliminated today?"
C1MlEkaPFgY,987619,995327,"- Oh, my gosh. - Ouch! Zach, already?  I mean, I got to ask.  I mean, they're doing an eyeball and that seems kind of basic."
C1MlEkaPFgY,995360,1001800,- Oh! - Ooh!  We weren't going to say anything.
C1MlEkaPFgY,1001833,1007205,"Jadon, Kirsten.  - Hello. - You guys don't have a lot up.  - Uh, not yet. - We don't."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1007238,1012210,"I'm a little nervous for you guys. I would start getting some stuff up.  - Yeah, we're fine. - It's slow, but it's steady."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1012243,1019351,"- Yeah. - The thought's there.  Yeah, it's like the tortoise and the hare, man.  You guys are so calm.  I think you're the calmest of the teams."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1019384,1025390,"And I believe you two are actually the youngest--  - Yeah, and I literally--   I just turned 18. - Oh."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1025423,1031496,Just curious. Are you two feeling intimidated?  - I'm not intimidated-- - I kind of am. I don't know.
C1MlEkaPFgY,1031529,1037770,"I know there's a story behind ours, so I don't know if everyone else has a theme.  - All right,   well, all right. - Keep working, y'all."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1043574,1047445,These eyeballs are going to look sick.  - I know. - Let's get that cut out.
C1MlEkaPFgY,1049114,1055787,"Oh, my God. My little biceps are getting a workout.  Oh, my God.  - I hate cardboard. - Oh, my God. Help. Okay."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1055820,1062160,"Here, take this one. I'll grab the other one.  This one goes on this side.  - Does it work? - It does."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1062193,1069234,"Oh, my God, yes. We have the most on our fence so far.  Really? Whew.  All right. I'm going to start this background."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1069267,1077276,"We should do a different color on the other side, right? Like a sun.  - A sunshiney day color-- - Yes.  - Artists, final hour. - Aah!"
C1MlEkaPFgY,1078576,1080579,I'm going to put the cups right here.
C1MlEkaPFgY,1084616,1092324,"All right. How's it look as far as the clouds go?  Hmm. Eh, you know what? Never mind, it's fine."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1092357,1099397,I don't like the cups for clouds.  I want like more-- I want something more puffy.
C1MlEkaPFgY,1099430,1106438,"The cups just look cheesy. The cups just don't look good in my opinion.  But, I mean, it is what it is."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1106471,1114246,"These coffee filters are kind of legit.  Oh, no.  - I think I might want to   leave this background to you. - Okay, that's fine."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1114279,1119551,- Because I keep   pushing them through. - That is fine.  And that's not okay. Let me cut her some hair.
C1MlEkaPFgY,1119584,1124589,"- Because she needs the hair. - Get all that hair.  I'm her hairstylist, okay?"
C1MlEkaPFgY,1124622,1131496,I feel like I'm very proud of this decision because this looks...  - Yup. - ...like something   I would hang up.  - You know what I'm saying? - It looks like   something we've planned.
C1MlEkaPFgY,1131529,1136735,"- Oh! - ( laughs )  Nick, this is looking kind of messy."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1136768,1142374,"Hold on. You're overthinking.  The green has to be neat, because the green is the part  - that's, like, the calm. - I think so, too."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1142407,1150348,Is there anything else we could use for the green?  We could weave this and this might look pretty neat.  - I like this color a lot. - Should we just get rid of everything that we've done
C1MlEkaPFgY,1150381,1155753,"- and put the ribbon?   It looks too messy. - I think so, yeah.  - Yeah, it's too messy.   It doesn't look good. - It's terrible.  - Let's restart. - Just get that out of here."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1155787,1161325,"Re-scramble.  I don't know if we have time to change the background,  but Marissa really seems stuck on it,"
C1MlEkaPFgY,1161359,1166731,so I guess we'll see how this goes.  It's going to be fine. Everything's fine.
C1MlEkaPFgY,1166764,1172671,"Artists.  My producer says you guys have to eat.  Jake, Michelle."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1172704,1178443,"Oh, yeah. Here.  - Pretzels. - Gummy bears."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1178476,1184316,"- Pretzels. - Oh, my God.  - Cookies. - Oh.  ( laughing )"
C1MlEkaPFgY,1184349,1189821,"Oh, you almost got Joseph.   ( music playing )"
C1MlEkaPFgY,1189854,1193792,"Enjoy the snacks.  - Thanks. - Why, thank you.  Bye!"
C1MlEkaPFgY,1195627,1200899,"Okay, so we need to get the earring.  - I think we should use   that gold record. - The record? Yeah."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1200932,1207639,"Oh, that's cool. We know we wanted some sort of a dramatic earring,  and using these records, I feel good."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1207672,1213912,- Looks like an earring. - That's dope. That's lit.  I'm starting to second guess these cups almost.
C1MlEkaPFgY,1213945,1219251,"I feel like, just plain old white clouds would be cheesy, so I got dark purplish."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1219284,1225523,"- Are they going to know   what that is, though? - Clouds. Definitely.  I'd honestly say leave it white. It balances it out."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1225556,1233298,"Because if we had too much color, then that umbrella is not going to look as bright.  Let's go for it, because if we leave the cups up there, it's not going to be great."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1233331,1238637,"Just don't want it to be wrong, because if it's wrong, it's a 100 grand mistake.  Let's just do it. I feel like it's going to work."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1238670,1245244,"Jadon: I'm a little bit nervous about the fence.  The purples clashed, in my opinion, and that honestly really scares me."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1248579,1254552,"- Here? - A little bit lower now.   A little higher now. Right there.  JB, I think that when we finish this,"
C1MlEkaPFgY,1254585,1262460,we need to go in with that iridescent and outline it again.  Because I think the butterfly's going to get lost.  So I feel we're going to need to take the iridescent and zigzag it.
C1MlEkaPFgY,1262493,1268767,"- Yeah. - It is like soaking wet, still.  What's the best way to attach this?  - You got it? - Yeah."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1268800,1276441,"It's like soaking wet. You're hands are going to be messy, too.  I'll just put-- ooh.  - Artists, 30 minutes. - Aah!"
C1MlEkaPFgY,1276474,1282814,"30 minutes, 30 minutes. What can we do in 30 minutes?  - Take a step back. - All right."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1282847,1288419,- What's up? - Just writing a little something--  - thinking about something   for a second. - Okay.
C1MlEkaPFgY,1288453,1294693,"Boy, there's around 30 minutes left,  and right now Jadon's just sitting on a ladder.  I'm not quite sure what he's doing."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1294726,1299898,Chilling. That's what he's doing. Chilling.  I need quiet. I can't think.
C1MlEkaPFgY,1299931,1306338,"- Should I do a pattern? - Yeah, I like that.   I like that.  - That's cool. We got this. - Yeah, we do."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1306371,1311843,"Marissa and Nick, do you guys have a team name by any chance?  The Perfect Disaster.  - The Perfect Disaster. - Oh."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1311876,1318783,"Joseph, Sophie?  - Our team name is Jophie. - Jophie.  - Kirsten, Jadon? - His name starts with a J."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1318816,1324456,"My name starts with a K. So, JK.  - Ryan and Tyler. - Paparazzi."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1324489,1329461,"David, JB?  - What's something gay? - Ooh!  - Team Pride? - Team Pride."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1329494,1335934,"- We're going to do that. - We'll do Team Pride.  Because we're so adorable.  All right, artists, eight minutes left."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1335967,1342507,Don't forget we need to see every space in that fence filled in.  - Home stretch. - Do you think that looks cool?
C1MlEkaPFgY,1342540,1348613,"Well, it looks cool now.  - Now we need to step on it. - ""Hust-le.""  Let me just braid this back."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1348646,1355554,"I want something in the background, but I don't know what could be quick.  Do you just wanna cut some squares out of this stuff.  Yes, let's go for it."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1357655,1363929,"I honestly have no idea what else to do, and it's spooking me.  - One minute left. - Aah!"
C1MlEkaPFgY,1365763,1373438,"Uh, tape, tape, tape, tape, tape.  Oh, my God. It's dripping.  5, 4, 3, 2..."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1373471,1378575, ( clock ticking )  ...one.  Step away from the art.
C1MlEkaPFgY,1378609,1385850,- Yay! - Whoo!  - Push it all in. - Yay!  - Did it. - We did it.
C1MlEkaPFgY,1385883,1392056,"- Oh, my gosh.   That was a great high-five. - That was amazing, right?  It made my ears ring.  Okay, guys. Are you ready to come out?"
C1MlEkaPFgY,1392089,1399931,- All: Yes. - For the second time.  And letting you out of the cage today is special guest Ethan from CrankGameplays.
C1MlEkaPFgY,1399964,1405170,"- ( cheering ) - Thank you.  Good job, everybody. I have the key."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1405203,1411576, Ethan is a huge YouTuber  that does super entertaining  commentary on video games.  Freaking love Ethan.
C1MlEkaPFgY,1411609,1417215,"I'm a fan, man. I look up to this guy.  You guys did a really, really great job."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1417248,1423655,"I don't even know how to draw anything,  so you can come out of your prison now."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1423688,1429895,"- Whoo. - Yay.  - Sweet. - All right, good job.  - Finally. - Get out."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1432497,1436133,Deep breath. We made it.
C1MlEkaPFgY,1438135,1443475,Zach: It's crazy. They only had four hours to work on these.  Ethan: I could not do this in four years.
C1MlEkaPFgY,1443508,1449580,"I love how the challenge was the same for everybody,  - but all of these   are wildly different. - Yeah."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1449614,1454919,"All right, Perfect Disaster, Marisa and Nick, come on up.  - What up? What up? - How're you guys doing?  - Good. - Pretty good."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1454952,1461893,"- Good. - Tell me about your piece.  What we were going for, an environmentalism kind of thing,  so it's the eye of the storm."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1461926,1467532,All eyes are on us because this is our generation's moment to do something about it.
C1MlEkaPFgY,1467565,1473204,"So you guys changed your plans about halfway through?  Yeah, so, at first, I started putting green tissue paper."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1473237,1480578,"And me and Nick wanted it to look more calm in the center versus messy on the outside.  So we kind of regrouped. ""Just take it all off,"
C1MlEkaPFgY,1480611,1485917,"and we'll just do the ribbon,"" and we like that so much better.  Dayna: I actually really love it."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1485950,1493958,"It starts with the beauty and then it goes out to all this chaos.  I love that the CDs were broken up, and that adds texture to the flower."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1493991,1499130,"- I really dig that. - Oh, thanks.  I love the little eye du-- is that a tear duct?"
C1MlEkaPFgY,1499163,1507305,"- Yeah, yeah. - It's a really small detail,  but it makes the whole thing come together more."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1507338,1513311,"I do really like how the flowers turned out.  It gives it a very 3-D look, and the eye was nice and shiny."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1513344,1520285,It has a little bit of a reflection. That was very nice.  I did hear one of the other teams call your piece a little bit basic.
C1MlEkaPFgY,1520318,1526090,"Psh! Basic? Okay.  Do you guys have any concerns about that?  Whatever. You got to love the haters, you know?"
C1MlEkaPFgY,1526123,1532163,"- Oof. - Got to love the haters.  All right, well, thank you, guys.  - Thank you. - Bye."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1532196,1540070,"Team Paparazzi, Ryan and Tyler,  would you like to explain what we're looking at here?  We wanted to do a silhouette and make sure that"
C1MlEkaPFgY,1540104,1546344,that was the main focal part of this piece.  We also wanted to create a piece where she's being amazing
C1MlEkaPFgY,1546377,1552917,"and all eyes are on her,  that's why people are taking pictures of her.  I really like what you guys did with the background."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1552950,1558189,"- Was it something   like coffee filters? - Coffee filters.  - Yeah.  - Yeah, gave it   a very clean look,"
C1MlEkaPFgY,1558222,1564629,"but you can also see a lot of texture on it, which I kind of like.  The main focus on this seems to be the hair over here."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1564662,1571135,Do you want to tell me about the hair?  I wanted to make sure that we were creating things  that literally picked up on what we're strong at.
C1MlEkaPFgY,1571168,1577942,"We're good at portrait work, and then, for me, the hair art.  So I wanted to create these strands of hair so it could really stand out"
C1MlEkaPFgY,1577975,1583381,and be literally draping off the canvas.  This is like Black Girl Magic at its finest.  - You know it. - I love it. I love it!
C1MlEkaPFgY,1583414,1589287,I just want to put this up against my ear and rock it.  Oops. I messed up her earring. I'm so sorry.
C1MlEkaPFgY,1589320,1594892,"Um, so many details. So many things to look at.  Also, who's idea was it for the record earrings?"
C1MlEkaPFgY,1594925,1600298,"- Ryan. - Yup.  - Nice, Ryan. - You don't have to be   so shy about it."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1600331,1608806,"I think you guys did such a good job on the background. I love how 3-D it is, too.  I love how the hair really pops off of the wall."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1608839,1615213,"- I think it looks amazing. - Thank you.  Team Jophie, tell us what you did here."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1615246,1620918,We obviously have the focal point as the moon and the sun.  And in the background we incorporated different planets
C1MlEkaPFgY,1620951,1626758,"and clouds to give it some texture and dimension.  How it comes together with the ""All Eyes On You"" theme"
C1MlEkaPFgY,1626791,1634165,"is the sun centers our solar system, so all eyes are up at the sun.  Zach: I actually really like how it's really split up. There's a lot of contrast."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1634198,1639303,I'm a big fan of just splitting things down the middle  and having two different sides to things.
C1MlEkaPFgY,1639336,1644942,"I agree. I think this is wonderful.  I did realize something, though."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1644975,1651182,"Zach, remember all those put-in cups we were tossing up.  - I know you would   bring those up. - Yeah, we knew that."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1651215,1658221,"- I forgot about those. - We really just had   a vision in our mind,  and we didn't think that we necessarily needed the cups."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1658255,1664195,"We thought it would kind of make it look like we took the easy way out.  Yeah, we just really wanted to prove that we were well-prepared"
C1MlEkaPFgY,1664228,1669801,and we didn't want to take any cheats.  - That's kind of a flex.   You get an advantage... - Wow.  - ...and you don't even use it. - I know.
C1MlEkaPFgY,1669834,1675073,"We really did it, so, yeah.  - Well, thank you so much. - Thank you.  Thank you, guys. Great job."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1676140,1682313,"Team JK, Jadon and Kirsten.  What are we looking at here?  Well, when we heard the theme ""All Eyes On You,"""
C1MlEkaPFgY,1682346,1689087,we thought about our circumstances right now. We're both 18.  We both are leaving the house for the first time to come do this show.
C1MlEkaPFgY,1689120,1694792,The umbrella represents our home and our families  that we've always been protected under.
C1MlEkaPFgY,1694825,1702400,"And now that we're out and doing this show,  we have a bunch of eyes on us, so the raindrops are the eyes."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1702433,1709173,I actually really like the story behind this.  I think it was nice and relatable that you guys  are going out for the first time and it's a little scary.
C1MlEkaPFgY,1709206,1715313,"I'm just curious, since there were so many materials to choose from  why you guys mostly went with fabric as the background"
C1MlEkaPFgY,1715346,1722018,"rather than picking out a ton of different materials?  We wanted a clean background so that you could focus on the rain and the umbrella,"
C1MlEkaPFgY,1722052,1729926,"which is when we did the purple fabric.  Before there were cups up here, which was going to give it kind of that clash of color."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1729960,1736267,"To me, I feel like, that was an added piece of texture  and kind of look like storm clouds a bit,"
C1MlEkaPFgY,1736300,1742073,so I kind of miss that visual part of it.  What made you make the decision to cover that?
C1MlEkaPFgY,1742106,1748279,"It was actually kind of my idea, because looking at it from afar,  I just felt like it was a lot for the eye to see."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1748312,1756821,"We already had a bunch of the rain,  and I was like, if I put the tablecloth stuff over the cups,  then it would give a more storm cloudy effect, you know?"
C1MlEkaPFgY,1756854,1764395,"So that's kind of what I was hoping on going for there, but...  I was a little unsure about underneath the umbrella with nothing behind it,"
C1MlEkaPFgY,1764428,1772069,and I thought you could've added a little bit more in there.  But I really like the story behind it.  I think we can all sort of relate to that.
C1MlEkaPFgY,1772102,1777975,"Thank you.  - Team Pride, David and JB. - How you guys doing?"
C1MlEkaPFgY,1778008,1786050,"- Good. How are you? - Fabulous!  So, tell us what we're looking at.  We both identity as part of the LGBTQ+ community."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1786083,1792089,"We wanted to bring the Pride celebration here,  and then we wanted to find a kind of creative way to incorporate the eyes"
C1MlEkaPFgY,1792122,1800231,"since the theme was ""All Eyes On You.""  So we wanted to kind of find that surreal, cool way  to incorporate the eyes in the butterfly, if that makes sense."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1800264,1805570,It's just so vibrant. It just makes me want to smile.  - Aww. Thank you. - Very happy.
C1MlEkaPFgY,1805603,1813010,"I love the highlights in the eyes.  - Really, really well done.   I love those. - Thank you.  I really like all the colors in the shiny CDs."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1813043,1818249,"I would say, I probably would've liked to see a little  bit more attention to detail on the background."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1818282,1825289,"I feel like the centerpiece was gorgeous,  but the background could've used a little bit more work,  and then the butterfly body kind of"
C1MlEkaPFgY,1825322,1830461,"blends into the background as well with the black.  Thank you, David and JB. Great job."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1830494,1838503,"- Thank you, guys.   Appreciate it. - Thank you.  I loved what we did. I was super proud of what we did,  but Zach said he doesn't like our background."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1845175,1851082,I know this was a crazy first day.  You got locked in a cage and you made fence art out of garbage.
C1MlEkaPFgY,1851115,1859323,"- Yeah. - Are you glad you signed up?  - All: Yes. - 100 percent.  Dayna: Joseph and Sophie, we're looking at you."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1859356,1865630,You guys know that somebody has to be sent home.  That makes me nervous. Not going to lie.
C1MlEkaPFgY,1865663,1871402,"Well, you two...  have won today's challenge."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1871435,1877341,"- No, way. - Good job, you guys.  The use of the celestial bodies watching over us"
C1MlEkaPFgY,1877374,1884649,"was a very creative interpretation  of the theme ""All Eyes On You,"" so congratulations.  - Thank you. - Good job, guys."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1884682,1890021,"- You did great. High-five. - Another high-five.  I know you guys are tired, so go chill in the lounge."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1890054,1897095,"- Okay! - Let's go before   they change their minds.  Yes, we did it! I can rest now."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1900230,1909040,"Okay. It is time to get to the nitty gritty.  JB and David, Kirsten and Jadon."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1909073,1915146,"Zach: I'm not going to mess with you.  I hate to say this, but your two teams are in the bottom."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1917381,1923554,I am shocked. We are in the bottom.  I'm so sad and surprised.
C1MlEkaPFgY,1923587,1931429,"Though your fence art was very creative,  I felt like the technique was  a little bit sloppy and could've been executed a little bit better."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1931462,1938235,"Ryan and Tyler, Marissa and Nick, you made it through.  Go to the lounge and chill."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1938268,1943106,"- We did it. - Great job, guys.  - Thank you. - Good job.  Good luck, you guys."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1945709,1953217,"All right, guys. We'd like for you guys to head back to the video labs.  That's the place where you guys will be making your videos throughout the season,"
C1MlEkaPFgY,1953250,1959457,"and also awaiting your fate.  The decision is ultimately going to be all on Zach here, okay?"
C1MlEkaPFgY,1959490,1966030,"And he-- yeah, man.  - Oh, man. - It's all on you.  He thinks he's nervous, we're the last two."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1966063,1972636,"So when he's ready, he'll come and tell you.  One team will move on and one team will go home."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1972669,1980077,"So you're telling me, I got a chance.  - Okay, see you in a bit. - Cool.  - See you guys, soon. - I'm sorry.   I love all of you guys."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1980110,1986350,"Oh, we love you.  - I do not envy you at all,   in any way. - Not at all."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1986383,1993324,"Well, both teams did an amazing job, considering it's four hours.  - Yeah. - But both teams struggled   with execution a little bit."
C1MlEkaPFgY,1997728,2006137,"Oh, my God.  Kirsten and Jadon's story was so strong,"
C1MlEkaPFgY,2006170,2011475,"but the art was not half\ as strong as the story.  I would agree with that. At the end of the day,"
C1MlEkaPFgY,2011508,2015780,"it's about the piece itself,  not necessarily the story behind it."
C1MlEkaPFgY,2017214,2023320,"Dayna: David and JB,  at least there was some elements of difficult techniques"
C1MlEkaPFgY,2023353,2032663,"with the shading that they did and the eyes.  The only thing that I would say,  their piece I don't think executed upon"
C1MlEkaPFgY,2032696,2039837,"the theme as well as Kirsten and Jadon's.  As far as theme goes, I feel like we went with the theme."
C1MlEkaPFgY,2039870,2046710,"Nailed with the theme. And the story.  Our storyline, the best by far.  Both teams had some parts where it was a little bit messy."
C1MlEkaPFgY,2046743,2054185,Could've been done better.  I think this is going to end up being a pretty close call.  - And it's a call that   you have to make. - Ahh!
C1MlEkaPFgY,2054218,2061559,"- All eyes on you now, sir. - Oh, I hate this part.  - We're here.   We're your support. - ( panting )"
C1MlEkaPFgY,2061592,2066763,"- I mean, we won't   be there physically. - Right.  - You do have to do it alone. - Right.  And all the pressure is on you."
C1MlEkaPFgY,2066797,2072269,"- Got it. - Okay. You can do it.  Well, Ethan, thanks so much for coming on today. I really appreciate it."
C1MlEkaPFgY,2072302,2077341,"Yeah, thank you, guys, so much for having me. This was super fun.  And, Dayna, I will see you soon."
C1MlEkaPFgY,2077374,2085648,"- See ya. - All right.  - You've got this. - Bye.  Ugh, okay.  - I'm trembling. - I know."
C1MlEkaPFgY,2085681,2089854,I don't want to come all the way out here to get out first round.  Praying we get through.
C1MlEkaPFgY,2101265,2106504,"When he called our name, I was like, ""Oh, man."" My heart sunk right?  - I know. - Oh!"
C1MlEkaPFgY,2106537,2112877,"- Oh, my-- - I stopped breathing   that entire time.  - Congrats, guys. - Thank you."
C1MlEkaPFgY,2112910,2118415,- Welcome back! - My heart is--  I've never been that anxious ever. I'm never doing that again.
C1MlEkaPFgY,2118448,2123420,"- Never doing that again. - I was tearing up.   I was shaking.  - Yeah, we were both-- - I wasn't nervous until   we sat on that damn bench."
C1MlEkaPFgY,2123453,2130427,"And I was like, ""Bitch."" My whole stomach dropped. I was like, ""Girl.""  Good job.  Jadon, Kirsten."
C1MlEkaPFgY,2130460,2138434,"- May I sit down, too? - Totally. Totally.  All right.  Well, unfortunately,"
C1MlEkaPFgY,2138468,2145176,"you guys didn't make it to the next round.  Honestly, if I were 18 years old  on such a big show, I'd be so scared."
C1MlEkaPFgY,2145209,2150614,"- It was a fun   experience though. - It was.  You both have a lot ahead of you, and keep going at it."
C1MlEkaPFgY,2150647,2157855,"Yeah. Thanks, dude. It means a lot, honestly.  Well, we're going to do a sign off.  This was Kirsten. This is Jadon."
C1MlEkaPFgY,2157888,2165296,"Y'all can find me at ""krimmins."" It's K-I-R--  K-R-I-M-M-I-N-S. Sorry. Spelling's hard."
C1MlEkaPFgY,2165329,2170467,"You can find me, MIXTCustoms on YouTube."
C1MlEkaPFgY,2170500,2176339,"Go. Subscribe to them right now.  - Yes, please. - Or I'll be kind of mad.  Trying to hit 100K by the end of the year."
C1MlEkaPFgY,2176373,2182479,"Come on, get them to 100K at least please.  Yes, please. Unfortunately, I did get cut,"
C1MlEkaPFgY,2182512,2188452,"I got to go home, but that doesn't stop me.  I had a goal set before this,  and I'm going to continue that goal after."
C1MlEkaPFgY,2188485,2195826,"Kirsten: I'm disappointed. I'm sad.  I mean, I'd be a madman to say I'm not sad about this."
C1MlEkaPFgY,2195859,2202667,"But, like, definitely, I'm just going--  I'm going to put it forward, I'm going to use it  as inspiration to just pop back up."
