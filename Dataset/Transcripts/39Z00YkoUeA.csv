39Z00YkoUeA,610,1677,- [Narrator] What do you do when there's
39Z00YkoUeA,1677,3750,"a big, bald, biker guy"
39Z00YkoUeA,3750,6690,who knows everything about your personal finances.
39Z00YkoUeA,6690,8650,- You make sure he gets the best darn
39Z00YkoUeA,8650,10870,Intel extreme tech upgrade possible.
39Z00YkoUeA,10870,12570,Guys we're gonna have some fun today.
39Z00YkoUeA,12570,15040,Meet Clarence from our accounting department.
39Z00YkoUeA,15040,15873,- Hi Guys!
39Z00YkoUeA,15873,17250,"- We are gonna be taking his living room,"
39Z00YkoUeA,17250,20430,which appears to already be adorn with electronics
39Z00YkoUeA,20430,23010,from work.
39Z00YkoUeA,23010,25060,That's becoming a bit of a theme in these.
39Z00YkoUeA,25060,26240,And we are gonna turn it into
39Z00YkoUeA,26240,29010,a surround sound home entertainment system.
39Z00YkoUeA,29010,30860,"Then we're gonna take his office,"
39Z00YkoUeA,30860,34410,"which, I think I also recognize this triple monitor stand,"
39Z00YkoUeA,34410,35400,but that's okay.
39Z00YkoUeA,35400,36890,It's in need of an upgrade too.
39Z00YkoUeA,36890,40140,And we are gonna be turning it into a sick battle station
39Z00YkoUeA,40140,42989,with three 32 inch 4k monitors.
39Z00YkoUeA,42990,47990,"Also, there's a memory foam bed topper, king size?"
39Z00YkoUeA,48580,51590,"Um, okay, not electronics, but hey, Intel"
39Z00YkoUeA,51590,54930,"didn't specify what you have to spend your $5,000 budget on."
39Z00YkoUeA,54930,58820,So let's have some fun and huge shout out to Intel
39Z00YkoUeA,58820,61560,for sponsoring Intel Extreme Tech Upgrade.
39Z00YkoUeA,61560,62393,Here we go.
39Z00YkoUeA,64948,65782,(beeping)
39Z00YkoUeA,65782,68365,(upbeat music)
39Z00YkoUeA,75270,76109,"Now I have to confess,"
39Z00YkoUeA,76110,78880,this was the most surprising part of your upgrade to me
39Z00YkoUeA,78880,80930,because you've actually got a pretty decent laptop.
39Z00YkoUeA,80930,82530,It's got a six gen processor.
39Z00YkoUeA,82530,84210,- [Clarence] I hate that computer.
39Z00YkoUeA,84210,85080,"- Okay then, there's"
39Z00YkoUeA,85080,87250,"- I've had nothing but problem with it since I bought it,"
39Z00YkoUeA,87250,90230,that's like the fifth chassis that it's been on and
39Z00YkoUeA,90230,91063,- Oh.
39Z00YkoUeA,91063,91896,- I hate that thing.
39Z00YkoUeA,91896,92729,- Okay.
39Z00YkoUeA,92729,97729,But then why did you go for such an OP creator spec laptop?
39Z00YkoUeA,97900,99130,Let's get this thing fired up
39Z00YkoUeA,99130,102229,'cause it's the MSI creator Z 16.
39Z00YkoUeA,102230,104820,"This thing is so over the top,"
39Z00YkoUeA,104820,107480,like you don't even game as far as I know.
39Z00YkoUeA,107480,111270,"- Don't, but it's gonna last me the next five, seven years."
39Z00YkoUeA,111270,113659,I want something that's gonna be around for a long time.
39Z00YkoUeA,113659,115960,"- You know, what's really funny is even internally,"
39Z00YkoUeA,115960,120159,people do a lot of their tech shopping based on LTT videos.
39Z00YkoUeA,120160,123650,"And Clarence comes to me after we do the sponsored on this,"
39Z00YkoUeA,123650,127230,"which was a while back. He goes, give it to me straight."
39Z00YkoUeA,127230,128447,Is it actually good?
39Z00YkoUeA,128447,129720,"And I go, yeah. Yeah."
39Z00YkoUeA,129720,130910,It's really good.
39Z00YkoUeA,130910,133540,So here it is with the sponsorship.
39Z00YkoUeA,133540,137430,Well behind us creator Z 16
39Z00YkoUeA,137430,138599,core I nine
39Z00YkoUeA,138600,139900,11th gen
39Z00YkoUeA,139900,144030,"RTX graphics. Amazing display, but that you won't be using."
39Z00YkoUeA,144030,147110,"So was three 27, oh these are 24's,"
39Z00YkoUeA,147110,148630,I guess it was time for an upgrade
39Z00YkoUeA,148630,149463,- Yep.
39Z00YkoUeA,149463,150295,- [Host] So you're going three.
39Z00YkoUeA,150296,153350,- [Host] Those are those aren't even HDMI monitors.
39Z00YkoUeA,153350,154280,"- Oh, okay."
39Z00YkoUeA,154280,155640,Not that that matters.
39Z00YkoUeA,155640,158090,"DVI and HTMI have no signal quality difference,"
39Z00YkoUeA,158090,159379,- Not DVI. VGA.
39Z00YkoUeA,159380,161213,"- These are, these are VG."
39Z00YkoUeA,161213,162170,Oh wow. Okay.
39Z00YkoUeA,162170,163002,"Yeah, it was time."
39Z00YkoUeA,163003,163836,Okay. Nevermind.
39Z00YkoUeA,163836,165260,I take it. Everything back
39Z00YkoUeA,165260,166510,"by the way, I love your calculator."
39Z00YkoUeA,166510,168540,Please tell me this has a story.
39Z00YkoUeA,168540,170819,- Oh yeah. This I got when I started working
39Z00YkoUeA,170820,174550,for the accounting firm in 2001
39Z00YkoUeA,174550,176150,and it's been with me ever since
39Z00YkoUeA,176150,178030,"I'll cry If I ever lose this calculator,"
39Z00YkoUeA,178030,179230,"- [Host] I, I won't take it from,"
39Z00YkoUeA,179230,181379,- there's still some guys that I know from my PWC days.
39Z00YkoUeA,181380,183730,"And we talk about this calculator, right Casey?"
39Z00YkoUeA,185310,186709,- Let's get this all sorted out for you here.
39Z00YkoUeA,186710,189010,Let's get these monitors going. Shall we?
39Z00YkoUeA,189010,192239,Now you're not expecting to reuse this same monitor stand.
39Z00YkoUeA,192240,193350,"Are you? Oh, you're"
39Z00YkoUeA,193350,194460,- too small.
39Z00YkoUeA,194460,195293,"Okay, good."
39Z00YkoUeA,195293,196630,I was hoping that you knew that
39Z00YkoUeA,198070,200520,the monitor stand that you took from the office.
39Z00YkoUeA,200520,201800,"- No, no. That was in the garbage."
39Z00YkoUeA,201800,203200,I picked it out of the garbage trailer.
39Z00YkoUeA,203200,204940,"- I, I remember saying they could get rid of it."
39Z00YkoUeA,204940,206940,"Yeah. Cause we tried to, we tried to give it away."
39Z00YkoUeA,206940,207810,We couldn't even give it away.
39Z00YkoUeA,207810,210222,And then Clarence turns out he wanted it.
39Z00YkoUeA,210223,211650,Apparently it's just so heavy.
39Z00YkoUeA,211650,213239,"No one, no one wanted it."
39Z00YkoUeA,213240,217530,This is so janky. You're using those old EVGA.
39Z00YkoUeA,217530,221130,Like what are these like USV to VGA adapter things.
39Z00YkoUeA,221130,223610,- Yep. But for years those have worked fine.
39Z00YkoUeA,223610,224840,They've done everything I need.
39Z00YkoUeA,224840,226620,"- That's fair. But I would've,"
39Z00YkoUeA,226620,229799,I would've at least hoped that you would use the DVA.
39Z00YkoUeA,229800,231370,I put on them.
39Z00YkoUeA,232589,234890,- I didn't have DVI cables.
39Z00YkoUeA,234890,237040,- We have an entire bin of them
39Z00YkoUeA,237040,239750,that we never touch at the office.
39Z00YkoUeA,239750,240720,- My keyboard. - Yeah.
39Z00YkoUeA,240720,242630,- I've used that exact one for the last 10 years.
39Z00YkoUeA,242630,243463,- Yeah.
39Z00YkoUeA,243463,244640,That's the keyboard that I use at Linus
39Z00YkoUeA,244640,245472,I brought it from home.
39Z00YkoUeA,245473,246980,So I had the same keyboard at Linus.
39Z00YkoUeA,246980,247812,"- Oh, oh really?"
39Z00YkoUeA,247813,248646,Yep.
39Z00YkoUeA,248646,250493,- Is that what you call work? Just Linus.
39Z00YkoUeA,251910,252743,- Sure.
39Z00YkoUeA,254383,255670,- Your Name is on the building.
39Z00YkoUeA,255670,259769,- I've heard most people shorten it to LMG or Linus Media.
39Z00YkoUeA,259769,261340,How many of these? You got.
39Z00YkoUeA,261340,262600,- Three. I have three of them.
39Z00YkoUeA,262600,264780,My fingers know exactly where every key is
39Z00YkoUeA,264780,266580,and that's why I don't wanna switch.
39Z00YkoUeA,267890,269100,"- I hear you. I mean,"
39Z00YkoUeA,269100,270270,I can understand why you'd need
39Z00YkoUeA,270270,272530,this much monitor real estate at work.
39Z00YkoUeA,272530,275720,"And you have almost this much monitor real estate at work,"
39Z00YkoUeA,275720,278283,but why do you need it at home?
39Z00YkoUeA,278283,280160,- I work some private clients.
39Z00YkoUeA,280160,280993,Ohh Okay.
39Z00YkoUeA,280993,281950,- Yep.
39Z00YkoUeA,281950,284610,- So it's for the same thing then essentially
39Z00YkoUeA,284610,285443,got it.
39Z00YkoUeA,285443,287889,We got him hooked on that monitor candy then.
39Z00YkoUeA,287890,291010,"- Oh, I was hooked long before I met you guys."
39Z00YkoUeA,291010,293440,"I, I used to work with a guy who had six."
39Z00YkoUeA,293440,294400,- Wow.
39Z00YkoUeA,294400,296650,- Awesome. 'cause every monitor had a purpose.
39Z00YkoUeA,296650,298560,I could totally have six.
39Z00YkoUeA,298560,300660,- Now we need to talk about this
39Z00YkoUeA,300660,304860,"because, the plug-able hub that Clarence is using"
39Z00YkoUeA,304860,306990,is actually not available yet.
39Z00YkoUeA,306990,309235,"- This is the MK two version two,"
39Z00YkoUeA,309235,312289,which we are the first people outside of plugable
39Z00YkoUeA,312290,313530,that actually have our hands on it.
39Z00YkoUeA,313530,315530,- So what's different about the mark two.
39Z00YkoUeA,315530,318020,- It has three
39Z00YkoUeA,318020,319090,display ports.
39Z00YkoUeA,319090,321460,The other one had two display ports and an HDMI.
39Z00YkoUeA,321460,323720,- Oh I see. So it's just.
39Z00YkoUeA,323720,326080,- Plus plus it does more power delivery.
39Z00YkoUeA,326080,327919,There's a bunch more ports on the front.
39Z00YkoUeA,327920,328802,- Got it.
39Z00YkoUeA,328802,329900,- It's just a cool upgrade.
39Z00YkoUeA,329900,331580,- Now you said you were sure all three of them
39Z00YkoUeA,331580,332669,were gonna fire up.
39Z00YkoUeA,332670,333503,- Yep
39Z00YkoUeA,333503,335220,"And I said, I wasn't sure about that."
39Z00YkoUeA,335220,337070,Which side did you plug into.
39Z00YkoUeA,337070,337903,- The other side?
39Z00YkoUeA,337903,338930,- You did plug into the other side.
39Z00YkoUeA,338930,339763,Let's try that
39Z00YkoUeA,340610,342560,and see if it behaves a little bit differently.
39Z00YkoUeA,342560,343750,- Oh. Now that there ya go.
39Z00YkoUeA,343750,344890,- Interesting.
39Z00YkoUeA,344890,345910,"So,"
39Z00YkoUeA,345910,347730,the thing about USB-C
39Z00YkoUeA,347730,351560,is that USB-C is just a connector.
39Z00YkoUeA,351560,355810,"So it depends on how that USB-C,"
39Z00YkoUeA,355810,359260,female port on your device is wired up internally
39Z00YkoUeA,359260,361010,what its capabilities are.
39Z00YkoUeA,361010,364000,So what that means as far as I can tell
39Z00YkoUeA,364000,365780,is that this side
39Z00YkoUeA,366720,370750,"Um, may have more display port lanes"
39Z00YkoUeA,370750,373160,available to it than this side potentially.
39Z00YkoUeA,373160,374850,But let's try the other side again.
39Z00YkoUeA,374850,376270,And what I suspect is gonna happen is
39Z00YkoUeA,376270,377763,it's gonna to say no again.
39Z00YkoUeA,378640,380010,- Here's my next question. - Yes.
39Z00YkoUeA,380010,381510,- I have a 90 degree L.
39Z00YkoUeA,381510,382370,"- No, it's fine. Nevermind."
39Z00YkoUeA,382370,383270,"- Oh good, great."
39Z00YkoUeA,383270,385930,"I, I have a 90 degree elbow."
39Z00YkoUeA,385930,388340,"So the cable doesn't stick that way, it goes."
39Z00YkoUeA,388340,389173,Will that work?
39Z00YkoUeA,389173,390006,"- I'm gonna give you a big,"
39Z00YkoUeA,390006,391220,probably not on that one.
39Z00YkoUeA,391220,394420,This is a very edge of the
39Z00YkoUeA,394420,396120,like edge of the spec
39Z00YkoUeA,396120,397440,configuration that you're running here.
39Z00YkoUeA,397440,398273,- Yeah.
39Z00YkoUeA,398273,399350,- You could try it. Do you wanna grab it?
39Z00YkoUeA,399350,400183,- If I can find it?
39Z00YkoUeA,400183,401270,- Yeah. Give it a shot.
39Z00YkoUeA,401270,403780,"This is really cool. It specifies on the back of that hub,"
39Z00YkoUeA,403780,405490,that two of the ports are display link.
39Z00YkoUeA,405490,407250,So those are the ones being driven
39Z00YkoUeA,407250,410250,by the laptops dedicated GPU.
39Z00YkoUeA,410250,412630,And then one of them is display port
39Z00YkoUeA,412630,414840,like alt mode over type C.
39Z00YkoUeA,414840,417699,And that one has to be driven by the onboard graphics.
39Z00YkoUeA,417700,419160,"So that's what I was talking about before,"
39Z00YkoUeA,419160,423120,when I was saying it depends on how everything is linked up
39Z00YkoUeA,423120,426380,"within your device, how a USB-C port might behave."
39Z00YkoUeA,426380,429410,"So we've got a compatible setup here, which is great."
39Z00YkoUeA,429410,431380,But one thing that's really important is if Clarence
39Z00YkoUeA,431380,434470,"or his kids or whatever ever wanted to actually play games,"
39Z00YkoUeA,434470,435610,this is totally capable of it.
39Z00YkoUeA,435610,438020,"It's got RTX 30, 60 GPU in it,"
39Z00YkoUeA,438020,441440,but we wanna make sure that our middle monitor
39Z00YkoUeA,441440,444390,"is one of the ones that's running in display link mode,"
39Z00YkoUeA,444390,446950,"and actually being driven by the proper GPU,"
39Z00YkoUeA,446950,448050,"Somehow, without"
39Z00YkoUeA,448050,450069,"putting anything confidential on the screen,"
39Z00YkoUeA,450070,452620,"can you show us what your, you know,"
39Z00YkoUeA,452620,455530,what you look like when you're in your accounting zone?
39Z00YkoUeA,455530,456900,- I can tell you.
39Z00YkoUeA,456900,457800,"- Yeah, sure."
39Z00YkoUeA,457800,459000,- I've got out look on this screen.
39Z00YkoUeA,459000,460650,- Okay. - So I monitor my email.
39Z00YkoUeA,461870,463460,Excel is usually running on this screen.
39Z00YkoUeA,463460,464293,- Okay.
39Z00YkoUeA,464293,466000,And QuickBooks or whatever I need to do
39Z00YkoUeA,466000,467470,is my second working screen.
39Z00YkoUeA,467470,469210,- Second working screen. Got it.
39Z00YkoUeA,469210,472750,You're the first one to go laptop for your daily driver.
39Z00YkoUeA,472750,474890,Why did you choose a laptop over a desktop?
39Z00YkoUeA,474890,475970,- Cause I'm not a gamer.
39Z00YkoUeA,475970,479140,And I take my laptop around tons of places.
39Z00YkoUeA,479140,480510,I like the portability.
39Z00YkoUeA,480510,481510,- Fair enough. - Yeah.
39Z00YkoUeA,481510,483427,"I mean these days, you're not even,"
39Z00YkoUeA,483427,485310,you're not even giving up that much in terms of performance
39Z00YkoUeA,485310,487720,is what like eight core CPU or something stupid like that.
39Z00YkoUeA,487720,489640,"- It's, it's gonna be a long time"
39Z00YkoUeA,489640,491800,"before I have to upgrade this laptop,"
39Z00YkoUeA,491800,493789,which is why I went the way that I did.
39Z00YkoUeA,493790,495710,- Yeah. Eight core 16 threads.
39Z00YkoUeA,495710,497690,32 gigs Ram.
39Z00YkoUeA,497690,499540,"Yeah, you're right. It'll be a while."
39Z00YkoUeA,500380,502200,And that's even accounting for that
39Z00YkoUeA,502200,504240,Clarence is one of those.
39Z00YkoUeA,504240,505160,I'm gonna use the word.
39Z00YkoUeA,505160,508240,One of those freaks who uses Excel so hard
39Z00YkoUeA,508240,510669,that it can actually take a while to process
39Z00YkoUeA,510670,511810,what he's doing.
39Z00YkoUeA,511810,513130,- I think my record is something like
39Z00YkoUeA,513130,514930,12 million calculations in one sheet.
39Z00YkoUeA,514930,516930,"- Yeah. I don't, I don't that doesn't surprise me."
39Z00YkoUeA,516930,519469,"Yeah. Now come, come, come on in, now"
39Z00YkoUeA,519469,521289,"you got to tell me about the plan here,"
39Z00YkoUeA,521289,524949,because obviously this guy's gonna go.
39Z00YkoUeA,524950,526550,- Most of this stuff is just here for looks.
39Z00YkoUeA,526550,527690,"These speakers are going,"
39Z00YkoUeA,527690,528523,these speakers are going
39Z00YkoUeA,528523,530500,they're from a totally different system.
39Z00YkoUeA,530500,533180,These two black ones or these two white ones are gonna be
39Z00YkoUeA,533180,534450,the left and rights.
39Z00YkoUeA,534450,536540,The other one's gonna be my center channel.
39Z00YkoUeA,536540,540170,And I've got these little guys they're going wireless
39Z00YkoUeA,540170,542510,to back behind the chairs for my full surround.
39Z00YkoUeA,542510,544350,- Cool. Okay.
39Z00YkoUeA,544350,548240,And I noticed that you tried to pull one over on me here
39Z00YkoUeA,549110,550800,"by covering it up,"
39Z00YkoUeA,550800,554339,but it's still a sin to put your TV above a fireplace.
39Z00YkoUeA,554340,555173,Let the record show.
39Z00YkoUeA,555173,556180,- Not a working fireplace.
39Z00YkoUeA,556180,557110,- Not a working fire.
39Z00YkoUeA,557110,557990,"Well, okay. All right."
39Z00YkoUeA,557990,560339,"So at least you don't have the heat concerns, but."
39Z00YkoUeA,560340,561660,"- Oh, you know what you didn't see,"
39Z00YkoUeA,561660,563600,There's a big ass sub behind that chair.
39Z00YkoUeA,563600,564472,- Ooh.
39Z00YkoUeA,565640,568420,Well you can't have base without a big ass sub.
39Z00YkoUeA,568420,569880,Get it big aa
39Z00YkoUeA,569880,573230,It doesn't matter. (laughing)
39Z00YkoUeA,573230,574600,"Okay, perfect."
39Z00YkoUeA,574600,576829,So I guess what we're trying to decide.
39Z00YkoUeA,576830,580160,"Do you have any kind of, any brilliant ideas for mounting?"
39Z00YkoUeA,580160,582850,Like these are supposed to be kinda like outdoor speakers.
39Z00YkoUeA,582850,586560,- I do. It's gonna eventually get mounted here like this.
39Z00YkoUeA,586560,588101,"- Oh, interesting. - I just ran out of time."
39Z00YkoUeA,588101,588934,"- Oh, okay."
39Z00YkoUeA,588934,590790,- So for today we're just gonna stick it right here.
39Z00YkoUeA,590790,592800,"Probably right there. It'll looks silly, but."
39Z00YkoUeA,592801,595050,- And what is this.
39Z00YkoUeA,595050,596799,- Woodish stuff.
39Z00YkoUeA,596799,597893,- Woodish. TM.
39Z00YkoUeA,600640,601880,What else we got here?
39Z00YkoUeA,601880,604950,"Harry Potter fan, but not of actually reading the books."
39Z00YkoUeA,604950,606217,"- Oh, hold on. There's a story behind that."
39Z00YkoUeA,606217,607360,"- Oh, There's a story. Sorry."
39Z00YkoUeA,607360,608576,"I figured, I figured there had to be a story."
39Z00YkoUeA,608577,610710,- I read to my kids every night.
39Z00YkoUeA,610710,611690,- But not Harry Potter.
39Z00YkoUeA,611690,612740,- That's our next series.
39Z00YkoUeA,612740,613573,- Okay.
39Z00YkoUeA,613573,615330,- So we read through all of
39Z00YkoUeA,615330,617170,this is all The Chronicles of Narnia.
39Z00YkoUeA,617170,619899,We read through you ever heard of the Land of Stories?
39Z00YkoUeA,619900,621110,Best book series ever.
39Z00YkoUeA,621110,622680,"My kids cried when we read through it,"
39Z00YkoUeA,622680,623513,"- Really,"
39Z00YkoUeA,623513,624780,- we are legitimate readers in this house.
39Z00YkoUeA,624780,626120,I read to my kids every night.
39Z00YkoUeA,626120,627510,- That's good. Super important.
39Z00YkoUeA,627510,629480,We're on Half-Blood Prince with my son.
39Z00YkoUeA,629480,630610,"I've been doing Harry Potter with him,"
39Z00YkoUeA,630610,632050,the girls are a little young.
39Z00YkoUeA,632050,634800,"They found it a little scary actually, which is really cute."
39Z00YkoUeA,634800,637060,"Um, Alright, what else can we poke around at here?"
39Z00YkoUeA,637060,639040,Now this I already know. This is super cute.
39Z00YkoUeA,639040,641839,The jar of awesome contains ticket stubs for everything fun
39Z00YkoUeA,641840,642690,they've done for the year.
39Z00YkoUeA,642690,645310,And then at the end they smash it on the concrete and then
39Z00YkoUeA,645310,646490,"get their fingers all cut up,"
39Z00YkoUeA,646490,648459,digging through the stubs to see what fun stuff they did.
39Z00YkoUeA,648460,649753,"- Exactly. - You don't smash it, Do you?"
39Z00YkoUeA,649753,652610,"- No. -No, Okay. Fair enough. Safety first."
39Z00YkoUeA,652610,654640,"All right, what else we got here?"
39Z00YkoUeA,654640,656930,Just start digging through stuff.
39Z00YkoUeA,656930,659390,HDM these are definitely stolen from work.
39Z00YkoUeA,659390,661600,Because they have work cable ties on them.
39Z00YkoUeA,661600,663769,- Everything I have have cable ties.
39Z00YkoUeA,663770,666100,"- Uh huh, yeah, but these are LTT cable ties"
39Z00YkoUeA,666100,668350,and CSawnic at cable ties.
39Z00YkoUeA,668350,669457,Wow. A DVD player.
39Z00YkoUeA,669457,674389,"That's that's uh, that's good technology right there."
39Z00YkoUeA,674390,675850,Google homed up though.
39Z00YkoUeA,675850,677370,Play my favorite song.
39Z00YkoUeA,677370,678880,It's gonna gonna be something really embarrassing.
39Z00YkoUeA,678880,680460,(easy music playing)
39Z00YkoUeA,680460,681590,Not what I imagined.
39Z00YkoUeA,681590,682860,"- Yeah, but I've got two girls."
39Z00YkoUeA,682860,684351,They're eight and nine. I just.
39Z00YkoUeA,684351,685500,"- I just, I was just expecting something"
39Z00YkoUeA,685500,686921,"like a little more hardcore, ya know."
39Z00YkoUeA,686921,689130,- That's what I listened to at work hailstorm.
39Z00YkoUeA,689130,692610,"- Yeah, Yeah. For sure. Without further ado,"
39Z00YkoUeA,692610,694910,let's actually get this show on the road then. Shall we?
39Z00YkoUeA,694910,697190,I see you've got a big roll of Rocket Fish
39Z00YkoUeA,697190,698130,speaker wire here.
39Z00YkoUeA,698130,701590,"I guess this is what's gonna drive our front speakers,"
39Z00YkoUeA,701590,702882,"but the surrounds are wireless, right?"
39Z00YkoUeA,702882,704270,- Yes. Okay.
39Z00YkoUeA,704270,706750,"Perfect. Oh, and we've got more speaker wire."
39Z00YkoUeA,706750,708480,Why do we need this much Speaker wire?
39Z00YkoUeA,708480,710584,- I've collected it over the years and I've never used it.
39Z00YkoUeA,710584,711417,- All right. Okay. Fair enough.
39Z00YkoUeA,711417,712830,Now you said that you wanted
39Z00YkoUeA,712830,715490,to remove this mantle piece here
39Z00YkoUeA,715490,717620,and get the TV farther back.
39Z00YkoUeA,717620,720320,So the idea is what you want to take this off?
39Z00YkoUeA,720320,722580,- Yeah. See these. See these two brackets.
39Z00YkoUeA,722580,723970,There should be just two screws.
39Z00YkoUeA,723970,726279,- Are we gonna gain that much more space though?
39Z00YkoUeA,726280,728160,Because this looks like a brick.
39Z00YkoUeA,728160,729600,- It is.
39Z00YkoUeA,729600,731980,We gain nothing. Okay. Let's not do it.
39Z00YkoUeA,731980,733260,"- Well, I mean it, I don't know."
39Z00YkoUeA,733260,735961,It's it's a couple inches. Last time I heard that counts.
39Z00YkoUeA,735961,738080,- Here. Use this takes less than that.
39Z00YkoUeA,738080,740790,"- Hey, look, you work in the accounting department,"
39Z00YkoUeA,740790,743230,you know the importance of LTT store.com. All right.
39Z00YkoUeA,743231,744510,There it is.
39Z00YkoUeA,744510,745973,- LTT store.com.
39Z00YkoUeA,748200,749230,- All right.
39Z00YkoUeA,749230,752032,"- Woodworking grade eight, 10 outta 10."
39Z00YkoUeA,753130,756169,"- Hey Clarence, have you ever used the bathroom in 105?"
39Z00YkoUeA,756169,757002,- Yeah. - Okay.
39Z00YkoUeA,757002,758643,Do you know that weird picture on the wall? There's a
39Z00YkoUeA,758643,759730,- I haven't spent that much time in there.
39Z00YkoUeA,759730,761930,"- There's a super weird picture. It's like a,"
39Z00YkoUeA,761930,764600,a bird lizard scorpion thing in the desert.
39Z00YkoUeA,764600,765630,"- Ooh, that one!"
39Z00YkoUeA,765630,767820,- Yeah. Okay. So that's my grade eight art project.
39Z00YkoUeA,767820,768660,- Oh really?
39Z00YkoUeA,768660,771750,- I did not get 10 outta 10.
39Z00YkoUeA,771750,772960,- That looks better. Doesn't it?
39Z00YkoUeA,772960,775310,I was about to say I can't tell the difference!
39Z00YkoUeA,777610,778587,- I like it.
39Z00YkoUeA,778587,780740,"- Okay, good. Good. If you're happy, I'm happy."
39Z00YkoUeA,780740,784399,"Now, is there any reason we couldn't just mount that today?"
39Z00YkoUeA,784400,786900,"Where, what, what do we need for that?"
39Z00YkoUeA,786900,788600,- I'd want to put a 2x4 backing up there
39Z00YkoUeA,788600,789758,to make it a little stronger.
39Z00YkoUeA,789758,791339,- Do you have a 2x4?
39Z00YkoUeA,791340,792173,- I do.
39Z00YkoUeA,792173,794970,- Yeah. You seem like the kind of guy who would have a 2x4.
39Z00YkoUeA,794970,795910,"I mean, look at this innovative"
39Z00YkoUeA,795910,797879,strategy to keep the table up here.
39Z00YkoUeA,797880,799480,- You know what I don't have?
39Z00YkoUeA,799480,800949,I don't have the right length screws.
39Z00YkoUeA,800950,802330,- No screws.
39Z00YkoUeA,802330,804090,"- Oh, I've got screws,"
39Z00YkoUeA,804090,806360,but they'll poke out the top of the table.
39Z00YkoUeA,806360,808290,- Do you have bolt cutters?
39Z00YkoUeA,808290,810630,"- I don't have bolt cutters, but I got an angle grinder."
39Z00YkoUeA,810630,811760,- Angle grinder will do.
39Z00YkoUeA,811760,813700,"- Ready for, for some power tool action."
39Z00YkoUeA,813700,814610,- Yeah. All right.
39Z00YkoUeA,814610,816670,"Please tell me you have eye protection. You're at home,"
39Z00YkoUeA,816670,818519,but you're still technically at work.
39Z00YkoUeA,819920,822850,"You can tell he wasn't gonna, he wasn't gonna use use those."
39Z00YkoUeA,822850,825319,Why I gotta be here to supervise
39Z00YkoUeA,825320,827740,"for all the good your 32 inch monitors are gonna do you,"
39Z00YkoUeA,827740,829050,"if you can't see anymore,"
39Z00YkoUeA,829050,831558,those are definitely not protective glasses.
39Z00YkoUeA,831559,834976,(angle grinder grinding)
39Z00YkoUeA,838398,839428,- Ow! Ah Ah!
39Z00YkoUeA,839428,841050,(Clarence laughing)
39Z00YkoUeA,841050,843060,"- Um, well that might go in."
39Z00YkoUeA,843060,844330,- Let start. (Clarence laughing)
39Z00YkoUeA,844330,846146,Start it with these ones.
39Z00YkoUeA,846146,847515,"- Start. Oh yeah. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
39Z00YkoUeA,847515,848348,Okay. Yeah.
39Z00YkoUeA,848348,850420,"Yeah, so okay, I'll keep one good one."
39Z00YkoUeA,850420,852339,And then I need three more cutoff.
39Z00YkoUeA,852340,853540,- I'll go outside and finish the rest.
39Z00YkoUeA,853540,855435,"- Okay I believe,"
39Z00YkoUeA,855435,857800,(drill whirring)
39Z00YkoUeA,857800,859959,"You know, I thought I was a pretty janky boy"
39Z00YkoUeA,859960,863633,and then I went to Clarence's and David's place.
39Z00YkoUeA,863633,864466,(monitor crashing)
39Z00YkoUeA,864466,865722,Ooh Ho
39Z00YkoUeA,865722,868472,(drill whirring)
39Z00YkoUeA,870400,873070,How much sentimental attachment do you have to this?
39Z00YkoUeA,873070,874010,"What, what is this called?"
39Z00YkoUeA,874010,875473,Like a side table or whatever.
39Z00YkoUeA,875473,877923,"- If we put hole through the top, I can patch it."
39Z00YkoUeA,880530,881890,- Okay. I think that's in the right spot.
39Z00YkoUeA,881890,884418,And as long as we can just have a mark.
39Z00YkoUeA,884418,888163,Good. Okay. (drill whirring)
39Z00YkoUeA,890998,891831,- I'm in.
39Z00YkoUeA,891831,892760,"- Ah, Nope, You're not."
39Z00YkoUeA,892760,894343,"- Oh, neither were you."
39Z00YkoUeA,896627,897820,"- Did we? - No, no, no. We're good."
39Z00YkoUeA,897820,898653,We're good.
39Z00YkoUeA,898653,899486,- Okay.
39Z00YkoUeA,901190,904170,"- Oh, sure. Okay. Uh, Yeah. Fine. Okay. Yeah, sure."
39Z00YkoUeA,904170,905683,Okay. Okay. Great.
39Z00YkoUeA,907240,908740,"Okay, - Dude, Perfect."
39Z00YkoUeA,908740,909620,- Getting toasty here.
39Z00YkoUeA,909620,912140,And all we've done is mount a center channel.
39Z00YkoUeA,912140,913940,It's kind of on there. Isn't it?
39Z00YkoUeA,913940,916410,"I mean, if you didn't know, you wouldn't know."
39Z00YkoUeA,916410,918060,- Nobody's gonna know.
39Z00YkoUeA,918060,919490,- Everybody's gonna know.
39Z00YkoUeA,919490,920870,- Nobody's gonna know.
39Z00YkoUeA,920870,923490,- Can I humbly request that we at least move them
39Z00YkoUeA,923490,926360,"to the outside of the, of the side table?"
39Z00YkoUeA,926360,929420,"Ah, I'm worried about this chair actually interfering, but."
39Z00YkoUeA,929420,931310,"- If, if they fit, absolutely, I just put em there"
39Z00YkoUeA,931310,932630,because I didn't think they'd fit.
39Z00YkoUeA,932630,936410,- What I really want is to get them two feet up.
39Z00YkoUeA,936410,938600,"I feel like it's a tall, tall order."
39Z00YkoUeA,938600,940759,"- I'll build two platforms off each side,"
39Z00YkoUeA,940760,942500,two little wings and I can put it on top.
39Z00YkoUeA,942500,944080,"- Okay. I mean, here's an idea."
39Z00YkoUeA,944080,946160,"Decorative speaker, speaker stand."
39Z00YkoUeA,946160,947237,- I have two of those.
39Z00YkoUeA,947237,948437,- You have two of these.
39Z00YkoUeA,949420,950430,- Taa Daa!
39Z00YkoUeA,950430,953149,Now what I would like is just some like blue tack
39Z00YkoUeA,953150,954020,or something like that
39Z00YkoUeA,954020,955248,so that we don't get vibration passing
39Z00YkoUeA,955248,958890,"through to the, the decorative Subwoofer here."
39Z00YkoUeA,958890,961750,- What color Playdough do you think Linus is gonna want?
39Z00YkoUeA,961750,963290,- I'll take acoustic Yellow.
39Z00YkoUeA,963290,966230,What I'm imagining is you ever made a snake?
39Z00YkoUeA,966230,967670,- Yep. - Made a Playdough snake.
39Z00YkoUeA,967670,969769,"So I want two snakes, one at the front,"
39Z00YkoUeA,969770,973340,one at the back and it'll just help us keep the vibrations
39Z00YkoUeA,973340,976030,from passing from the speakers to the thing under it.
39Z00YkoUeA,976030,977840,To be clear. This is not a perfect solution.
39Z00YkoUeA,977840,979110,Clarence is gonna build his wings
39Z00YkoUeA,979110,982149,and then that will be the proper solution.
39Z00YkoUeA,982150,984047,- In 10 years.
39Z00YkoUeA,984047,984880,- Oh God .
39Z00YkoUeA,986930,989230,"Okay, so we've got our front"
39Z00YkoUeA,989230,990899,"actually, I guess that's it then because the others"
39Z00YkoUeA,990900,991733,are wireless.
39Z00YkoUeA,991733,993449,So where's your transmitter for these guys?
39Z00YkoUeA,993450,994760,- That's this?
39Z00YkoUeA,994760,996930,- So that's part of the Intel Extreme Tech Upgrade.
39Z00YkoUeA,996930,997763,- Yep. - Got it.
39Z00YkoUeA,997763,999250,That's for the rears. - Great.
39Z00YkoUeA,999250,1001040,- And
39Z00YkoUeA,1001040,1002329,that's the sub.
39Z00YkoUeA,1002330,1003163,"- Oh, perfect."
39Z00YkoUeA,1003163,1004020,Okay.
39Z00YkoUeA,1004020,1006790,Did you research this one or is this something that someone
39Z00YkoUeA,1006790,1009759,else advised you? I've never heard of this before?
39Z00YkoUeA,1009760,1011040,- Yeah.
39Z00YkoUeA,1011040,1012170,- Sorry. Which one?
39Z00YkoUeA,1012170,1013560,- Oh no. I did research it.
39Z00YkoUeA,1013560,1016290,"- Oh, okay, Cool. This seems extremely straightforward."
39Z00YkoUeA,1016290,1017579,"You got your power in,"
39Z00YkoUeA,1017580,1021603,you got your Subwoofer and line in speakers in.
39Z00YkoUeA,1021603,1026603,"Then you got your speakers out. Subwoofer out, volume knob."
39Z00YkoUeA,1027100,1028750,"Yeah. Not, not a whole lot to it."
39Z00YkoUeA,1029750,1031990,"- Hey, Linus, does that do both speakers and sub"
39Z00YkoUeA,1031990,1032823,"- Yeah, Looks like it."
39Z00YkoUeA,1032823,1034439,- Cause I got separate boxes for the sub.
39Z00YkoUeA,1034439,1037629,"- Oh, well I don't think you need that."
39Z00YkoUeA,1037630,1038990,- Oh. Cool.
39Z00YkoUeA,1038990,1041079,"- Where do you want the sub,"
39Z00YkoUeA,1041079,1042299,"there, Oh, well, I mean,"
39Z00YkoUeA,1042300,1043621,"in that case, why do you,"
39Z00YkoUeA,1043621,1045339,why are you going wireless to the sub it's right there.
39Z00YkoUeA,1045339,1046419,- You can go wired.
39Z00YkoUeA,1046420,1049620,"- Yeah. Do you have a, do you have an RCA cable?"
39Z00YkoUeA,1049620,1050823,He's got an RCA cable.
39Z00YkoUeA,1051880,1052713,He'll find it.
39Z00YkoUeA,1054380,1056710,- I know why Linus. I don't have one long enough.
39Z00YkoUeA,1056710,1057628,"- Oh,"
39Z00YkoUeA,1057629,1058462,"but wait,"
39Z00YkoUeA,1058462,1061613,then you bought a wireless Subwoofer kit instead of a cable.
39Z00YkoUeA,1062600,1063433,- Yeah.
39Z00YkoUeA,1063433,1064266,"- Oh, okay."
39Z00YkoUeA,1066349,1067379,- Thanks Intel.
39Z00YkoUeA,1067379,1068650,- Yeah. Thanks Intel.
39Z00YkoUeA,1068650,1069800,"In that case, we'll probably"
39Z00YkoUeA,1069800,1071380,need the separate box anyway then.
39Z00YkoUeA,1071380,1073987,"So maybe you had already thought of that, but just forgot."
39Z00YkoUeA,1073987,1076830,- Did We talk about like why we choose this?
39Z00YkoUeA,1076830,1079070,"- Ah, We didn't really have a good reason other than that."
39Z00YkoUeA,1079070,1080289,- Oh yeah. I have a very good reason.
39Z00YkoUeA,1080290,1082590,"- What, I thought you just told me, it just was like,"
39Z00YkoUeA,1082590,1083840,you just picked it.
39Z00YkoUeA,1083840,1084950,- Oh no.
39Z00YkoUeA,1084951,1087260,"The system I picked the system 'cause it's good,"
39Z00YkoUeA,1087260,1089480,but I picked the wireless cause I hate wires.
39Z00YkoUeA,1089480,1091510,- Oh. Do you have any flexibility
39Z00YkoUeA,1091510,1093140,on the positioning of the subwoofer?
39Z00YkoUeA,1093140,1096340,Is there any reason not to have it in this corner?
39Z00YkoUeA,1096340,1097773,- Wireless move it.
39Z00YkoUeA,1099210,1100070,- All right.
39Z00YkoUeA,1100070,1102779,My main concern and the reason for doing this is just that
39Z00YkoUeA,1102780,1105730,I don't want any more wireless devices in the room
39Z00YkoUeA,1105730,1108010,"than we absolutely have to have because yes,"
39Z00YkoUeA,1108010,1110690,"wireless has the benefit of, fewer wires,"
39Z00YkoUeA,1110690,1113639,but it also has the drawback of potential interference.
39Z00YkoUeA,1113640,1115130,"So if we can have just one system,"
39Z00YkoUeA,1115130,1118160,I would prefer that I think you've stolen more cable ties
39Z00YkoUeA,1118160,1119840,"than anyone else, so far"
39Z00YkoUeA,1119840,1120950,LTTStore.com.
39Z00YkoUeA,1120950,1122750,"- yeah, but I'm the cable management master."
39Z00YkoUeA,1122750,1126070,"- Oh, I don't know if cable management master is necessarily"
39Z00YkoUeA,1126070,1127700,the term I would use.
39Z00YkoUeA,1127700,1129529,It's not even plugged in Clarence!
39Z00YkoUeA,1129530,1133228,- It's never been used Mr. Cable management king.
39Z00YkoUeA,1133228,1134940,"It doesn't, it's easy to cable manage."
39Z00YkoUeA,1134940,1137080,When you don't have to plug anything into the wall.
39Z00YkoUeA,1137080,1140159,- I was waiting for you to come install it. (laughing)
39Z00YkoUeA,1140160,1141440,"- Well, at least you didn't wait for me to come"
39Z00YkoUeA,1141440,1142273,paint your wall.
39Z00YkoUeA,1142273,1143730,"That was, that was the worst one."
39Z00YkoUeA,1143730,1145919,"Yeah. That's right, Andy."
39Z00YkoUeA,1145920,1146930,- You're welcome.
39Z00YkoUeA,1146930,1148260,- Where'd you get this thing from.
39Z00YkoUeA,1148260,1150410,- Craigslist. - Craigslist. Okay. Perfect.
39Z00YkoUeA,1151460,1152813,Subwoofer out. Okay.
39Z00YkoUeA,1154410,1156740,Do you wanna power on the back unit and we'll see what
39Z00YkoUeA,1156740,1160093,happens here. (white noise sound)
39Z00YkoUeA,1161840,1163730,It did not
39Z00YkoUeA,1163730,1165559,"grab our rear speakers,"
39Z00YkoUeA,1165560,1167750,but it grabbed the Subwoofer.
39Z00YkoUeA,1167750,1170440,"- I'm gonna have a look at the front, right wiring here."
39Z00YkoUeA,1170440,1171610,It's seems fine on.
39Z00YkoUeA,1171610,1173320,"- Hey Linus, this has a volume switch."
39Z00YkoUeA,1173320,1175100,It was almost off.
39Z00YkoUeA,1175100,1175933,- Oh.
39Z00YkoUeA,1176780,1179410,- Well that could be it. You know what?
39Z00YkoUeA,1179410,1180950,Okay. These are loose.
39Z00YkoUeA,1180950,1182408,Here's what I think happened.
39Z00YkoUeA,1182408,1184159,This is one of those speakers.
39Z00YkoUeA,1184160,1185570,"I forget the term for it right now,"
39Z00YkoUeA,1185570,1186889,but where you can
39Z00YkoUeA,1188190,1192860,drive the tweeter and the woofer separately.
39Z00YkoUeA,1192860,1196090,And it's not set up that way right now.
39Z00YkoUeA,1196090,1200409,"Okay. See the inputs are just bridged, but these were loose."
39Z00YkoUeA,1200410,1201360,So I think what was happening
39Z00YkoUeA,1201360,1205893,was we were just driving the tweeter. (white noise sound)
39Z00YkoUeA,1209724,1210580,"What? - Oh, watch it."
39Z00YkoUeA,1210580,1212350,There. There was a seventh speaker.
39Z00YkoUeA,1212350,1213183,Run it again.
39Z00YkoUeA,1213183,1214890,- What the? Devil
39Z00YkoUeA,1216820,1219019,It's running these as subwoofer.
39Z00YkoUeA,1219020,1223423,"- Maybe, Maybe that thing can't run a sub."
39Z00YkoUeA,1224788,1228069,"- Stop, stop, stop, stop. Stoop."
39Z00YkoUeA,1228069,1229350,Mute.
39Z00YkoUeA,1229350,1231923,"Nope. Ah, I figured it out."
39Z00YkoUeA,1233570,1236500,I felt these were more rear channels
39Z00YkoUeA,1236500,1237680,because of their positioning.
39Z00YkoUeA,1237680,1239400,So I plugged them into rear
39Z00YkoUeA,1239400,1242450,and it comes up on the report.
39Z00YkoUeA,1242450,1244320,"Oh no rear detected,"
39Z00YkoUeA,1244320,1246490,but it never actually tries the test them.
39Z00YkoUeA,1246490,1250500,"So let's get them into the surround, the regular surround,"
39Z00YkoUeA,1250500,1251810,not surround back ports.
39Z00YkoUeA,1251810,1253835,And then I think that'll address it.
39Z00YkoUeA,1253835,1258252,(white noise going in surround mode)
39Z00YkoUeA,1263980,1266100,- Yay.
39Z00YkoUeA,1266100,1266933,Woop Woop.
39Z00YkoUeA,1266933,1267970,- Story. Really starts.
39Z00YkoUeA,1267970,1269570,- Whoa. Oh yeah.
39Z00YkoUeA,1269570,1272179,- That was four months ago on my team's first mission.
39Z00YkoUeA,1272180,1273350,- The sub works.
39Z00YkoUeA,1273350,1275210,- Yes. The sub is working.
39Z00YkoUeA,1275210,1276902,- Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
39Z00YkoUeA,1276902,1280190,Little bit compared to how bad the TV speaker.
39Z00YkoUeA,1280190,1281970,- My chair is shaking.
39Z00YkoUeA,1281970,1284270,"- Yeah, looks so much better too."
39Z00YkoUeA,1284270,1285103,- Looks good. Doesn't it?
39Z00YkoUeA,1285103,1286390,- Yeah looks
39Z00YkoUeA,1286390,1287740,Just way better.
39Z00YkoUeA,1287740,1289090,- You know what I think I'm gonna do
39Z00YkoUeA,1289090,1290580,get some black cloth
39Z00YkoUeA,1290580,1292360,and cover that speaker with black cloth.
39Z00YkoUeA,1292360,1295970,"- Heck yeah. While I disapprove of the height of your TV,"
39Z00YkoUeA,1295970,1297830,I absolutely approve of the fact that you don't
39Z00YkoUeA,1297830,1298860,have any motion smoothing
39Z00YkoUeA,1298860,1300330,or any of that nonsense turned on.
39Z00YkoUeA,1300330,1301659,"We've taught you well,"
39Z00YkoUeA,1301660,1303070,either that or it was already set up
39Z00YkoUeA,1303070,1304120,and you didn't touch the settings.
39Z00YkoUeA,1304120,1305340,When you went into the Christmas party.
39Z00YkoUeA,1305340,1309291,"- Uhhh, I, uh, set it the way he said."
39Z00YkoUeA,1309291,1310950,"- Haha, Now the only thing left"
39Z00YkoUeA,1310950,1314549,is the weirdest part of this upgrade the mattress topper.
39Z00YkoUeA,1314550,1317960,I'm experiencing some regret about our strategy of taking
39Z00YkoUeA,1317960,1320763,everything that was in our way and dumping it here.
39Z00YkoUeA,1320763,1323269,(mimicking crying)
39Z00YkoUeA,1323270,1324103,"- Oh, oh well, we'll move it."
39Z00YkoUeA,1324103,1325940,- Okay. Here we go.
39Z00YkoUeA,1325940,1326907,We're basically just
39Z00YkoUeA,1326907,1328760,"playing the,"
39Z00YkoUeA,1328760,1331060,the one free space game
39Z00YkoUeA,1331060,1332480,because I don't wanna end up buying
39Z00YkoUeA,1332480,1333997,you a new bed.
39Z00YkoUeA,1333998,1335590,(crashing noise)
39Z00YkoUeA,1335590,1338494,I'm gonna let you do the actual crawling around on it.
39Z00YkoUeA,1338494,1340000,"- Before, before you open it."
39Z00YkoUeA,1340000,1341560,Let's rip all the bedsheets and everything off.
39Z00YkoUeA,1341560,1342810,- Oh. For sure. Okay.
39Z00YkoUeA,1342810,1345930,You'll see if it breaks. It's not because I touched it.
39Z00YkoUeA,1345930,1347180,I'm trying to get it out.
39Z00YkoUeA,1348720,1351289,"It's it's trying to expand as I,"
39Z00YkoUeA,1351290,1354020,as I try and slide the slip off of it.
39Z00YkoUeA,1354020,1355820,Is this the right size?
39Z00YkoUeA,1355820,1357120,- I think so.
39Z00YkoUeA,1357120,1360670,"- Looks a little short. Well, is it gonna expand,"
39Z00YkoUeA,1360670,1363650,"give mattress topper time to rise, to intended size."
39Z00YkoUeA,1363650,1364483,"So yeah,"
39Z00YkoUeA,1364483,1367290,I think it actually just needs to sit here for a while.
39Z00YkoUeA,1367290,1369640,"Oh, I learned something the other day."
39Z00YkoUeA,1369640,1371470,Do you wanna know how to put the sheet on right
39Z00YkoUeA,1371470,1372809,first try every time.
39Z00YkoUeA,1372810,1373643,- Yep.
39Z00YkoUeA,1373643,1376899,- The tag is in the bottom right corner.
39Z00YkoUeA,1376900,1380120,It's one of those USB port type things where I would try it
39Z00YkoUeA,1380120,1381570,"this way then this way,"
39Z00YkoUeA,1381570,1384990,"then this way again until finally settling, see"
39Z00YkoUeA,1384990,1385990,Life hack.
39Z00YkoUeA,1385990,1388470,- I was today years old. When I learned that
39Z00YkoUeA,1388470,1393100,"- this guy with the memes, with the young people slang."
39Z00YkoUeA,1393100,1396030,"Well, you gotta try it. You gotta tell us how it feels."
39Z00YkoUeA,1396030,1396863,"All right. I mean,"
39Z00YkoUeA,1396863,1399120,"it's probably not reached its final state yet, but."
39Z00YkoUeA,1399120,1400679,"- Oh, okay."
