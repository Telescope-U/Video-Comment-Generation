VJI88QIW7H4,2802,5472,( indistinct chatter )
VJI88QIW7H4,7573,10576,"Let's, uh, see what people think about you."
VJI88QIW7H4,10643,14346,"- Oh, my God. - Whoa, look at this guy."
VJI88QIW7H4,14413,17550,- What is this? - What year was this?
VJI88QIW7H4,18784,20086,- ( computer beeps ) - Oh.
VJI88QIW7H4,20153,23456,( computer beeping )
VJI88QIW7H4,23523,26192,I feel like I'm in a hospital.
VJI88QIW7H4,26259,30296,"Honestly, though, these would be cute coasters."
VJI88QIW7H4,30363,32631,This is definitely a computer.
VJI88QIW7H4,32698,35634,- Yes. Right. - 100% computer.
VJI88QIW7H4,35701,38104,I've never-- is this Apple?
VJI88QIW7H4,38171,40372,- This is the Apple I? - Is this is the first Mac?
VJI88QIW7H4,40439,42607,"It is, in fact, the first Mac."
VJI88QIW7H4,42675,45845,"- Oh, ( bleep ). - The original from 1984."
VJI88QIW7H4,45912,48413,- Wow. - I wasn't even born yet.
VJI88QIW7H4,48481,49815,"Same, same."
VJI88QIW7H4,49882,53819, ( music playing )
VJI88QIW7H4,53886,58324, I'm Marques Brownlee  and I review dope new tech.
VJI88QIW7H4,58391,60493," But on this show,  I'm rewinding the clock"
VJI88QIW7H4,60560,62661, to discover  the tech of the past
VJI88QIW7H4,62728,64564, that changed  our lives forever.
VJI88QIW7H4,66399,69568," This is  ""Retro Tech: Macintosh."""
VJI88QIW7H4,69635,71537,"Hey, what's up, guys? MKBHD here,"
VJI88QIW7H4,71604,76375,And today we're going to be talking about the 1984 Mac.
VJI88QIW7H4,76442,77743, The original.
VJI88QIW7H4,77810,80779," So this came out  nine years before I was born,"
VJI88QIW7H4,80846,84150,"so by the time I was actually using computers,"
VJI88QIW7H4,84217,86819,this thing would have been gathering dust in my parents' basement.
VJI88QIW7H4,86886,88888,"This wasn't the first ever personal computer,"
VJI88QIW7H4,88955,91357,but this was the one that changed the way we think
VJI88QIW7H4,91424,93759,about what computers are and what they can do.
VJI88QIW7H4,93826,95127,It's so easy to think of Apple
VJI88QIW7H4,95194,98197,"as this massive company, because they are one now."
VJI88QIW7H4,98264,99398,"But it wasn't always that way,"
VJI88QIW7H4,99465,100665,and this is one of the computers
VJI88QIW7H4,100733,103202,that helped define what they've become today.
VJI88QIW7H4,103269,105638,"So, uh, let's take a closer look in the box."
VJI88QIW7H4,105705,108607, ( music playing )
VJI88QIW7H4,108674,111710,"So, we got your user guide. Oh, look at that."
VJI88QIW7H4,111777,114813,That's how you should be using your Mac. Just kick back.
VJI88QIW7H4,114880,117850,Apple stickers. These are probably worth a lot.
VJI88QIW7H4,117917,119885,"Also, the plastic has an Apple logo on it."
VJI88QIW7H4,119952,121554,Even the plastic is Apple plastic.
VJI88QIW7H4,121621,123389,It's special.
VJI88QIW7H4,123456,125558,And there are two floppy disks--
VJI88QIW7H4,125625,128259,"""A Guided Tour of Macintosh"" and your system disk."
VJI88QIW7H4,128326,131263,Don't lose that.
VJI88QIW7H4,131330,133299,Something about tech at this time
VJI88QIW7H4,133366,135433,is always this color for some reason.
VJI88QIW7H4,135501,138571,"I don't know why, but that's where we're at."
VJI88QIW7H4,138638,143242,"Ah, this is the keyboard. Guess what color."
VJI88QIW7H4,143309,145444,1980s brown.
VJI88QIW7H4,145511,148314,"All right, so I'm fully ready for the Mac at this point."
VJI88QIW7H4,148381,149415,"That's convenient, actually."
VJI88QIW7H4,149482,151984,There's a handle right at the top.
VJI88QIW7H4,152051,154386,We can just pick up the whole Mac just like that.
VJI88QIW7H4,154453,156789,"Just like-- just like a bowling ball, basically."
VJI88QIW7H4,156856,159225,"That's about the weight of a good bowling ball, too."
VJI88QIW7H4,159292,160893,"You know, tech demos these days are always trying to show you"
VJI88QIW7H4,160960,163529,what you can do with it. This was a very effective demo.
VJI88QIW7H4,163596,166999,"Oh, yeah. Come with me. I have my computer with me."
VJI88QIW7H4,167066,168667,"Of course, you need to plug it into the wall and everything,"
VJI88QIW7H4,168734,170069,but I like that handle.
VJI88QIW7H4,170135,172905,"So what do you say we, uh, get this thing turned on?"
VJI88QIW7H4,174940,177443,( beeps )
VJI88QIW7H4,177510,180547,( whirring )
VJI88QIW7H4,181847,183682,( buzzing )
VJI88QIW7H4,183749,185618,It's making noises for sure.
VJI88QIW7H4,188988,191457,All right. Screen is functional.
VJI88QIW7H4,191524,192525,Mouse is functional.
VJI88QIW7H4,192592,194760,It's just giving me a question mark.
VJI88QIW7H4,194827,197496,"Oh, I need the system disk, don't I?"
VJI88QIW7H4,197563,200499,"Even in all this space, there's no internal memory."
VJI88QIW7H4,200566,203769,There's no way for it to know how to start up without this.
VJI88QIW7H4,203836,206472,This is the important piece right here.
VJI88QIW7H4,206539,208775,This is the OS. This is the system.
VJI88QIW7H4,213779,216315,That's still super-satisfying.
VJI88QIW7H4,216382,217850,Would you look at that?
VJI88QIW7H4,217917,219785,"""Welcome to Macintosh."""
VJI88QIW7H4,219852,220986,Let's get into it.
VJI88QIW7H4,221053,223555, ( music playing )
VJI88QIW7H4,223622,226424, The OG Macintosh is something  I know very little about.
VJI88QIW7H4,226492,229928," In fact, I didn't even own  a Mac until 2010."
VJI88QIW7H4,229995,231830, But I always see that '84 Mac
VJI88QIW7H4,231897,234533, referenced as one of  the most important computers
VJI88QIW7H4,234600,237936," of all time, which seems like  a pretty big deal."
VJI88QIW7H4,238003,240639, So what is it about  the original 1984 Mac
VJI88QIW7H4,240706,242674, that changed the game  and made way
VJI88QIW7H4,242742,245611, for everything else  that followed?
VJI88QIW7H4,245678,248047,"- Ken, thanks for doing this. - Yeah, my pleasure."
VJI88QIW7H4,248114,249681,"- Great to meet you. - You, too."
VJI88QIW7H4,249749,251750,"All right. I'm gonna start, actually,"
VJI88QIW7H4,251817,254086,by having you check underneath your seat.
VJI88QIW7H4,254153,255754,- Is it something-- - There's something   there for you.
VJI88QIW7H4,255821,258489,"- Oh. - Oh, look at that!"
VJI88QIW7H4,258557,262928,"And there it is, the original Macintosh keyboard."
VJI88QIW7H4,262995,265464,Just the sound of it reminds me of being a kid.
VJI88QIW7H4,265531,266332,( clacking )
VJI88QIW7H4,266399,267500,I like a nice loud keyboard.
VJI88QIW7H4,267566,268367,It makes me feel like I'm doing something.
VJI88QIW7H4,268434,269435,I'm working hard over here!
VJI88QIW7H4,269502,273739,This is great. This is so great.
VJI88QIW7H4,273806,275341,Did the average person in the '60s or '70s
VJI88QIW7H4,275408,276709,even really know what a computer was?
VJI88QIW7H4,276776,279845,The average person had no idea what a computer was.
VJI88QIW7H4,279912,282981,Announcer:  The strange world  of the computers.
VJI88QIW7H4,283048,284049, Devised by engineers...
VJI88QIW7H4,284116,285417,"Pre-Apple, the computer industry"
VJI88QIW7H4,285484,288587, was really found  in just a handful of places--
VJI88QIW7H4,288654,291623," the military,  scientific institutes."
VJI88QIW7H4,291690,294126,Humphrey:  It was something  that companies did
VJI88QIW7H4,294193,296794, to crunch massive amounts  of data.
VJI88QIW7H4,296862,298897,"The original computers, they were very cinematic in a way."
VJI88QIW7H4,298964,301065, They took up an entire room.
VJI88QIW7H4,301133,303001,They had the giant reel-to-reel  tape machines on them.
VJI88QIW7H4,303068,305471, They whirred and clicked  and made cool noises.
VJI88QIW7H4,305538,307072,( imitating whirring )
VJI88QIW7H4,307139,308607,You had guys in white lab coats
VJI88QIW7H4,308674,309575, who were the only ones  who were allowed to use them.
VJI88QIW7H4,309641,312378, They didn't even have screens.
VJI88QIW7H4,312445,314413,"Humphrey: So at that time,"
VJI88QIW7H4,314480,316749, IBM was the biggest computer  company in the world.
VJI88QIW7H4,316816,320686,Segall: IBM-- International  Business Machines.
VJI88QIW7H4,320753,323655,You couldn't have a more cold and inhuman name.
VJI88QIW7H4,323722,325758,"Ackerman:  They'd been around making,  you know, calculators"
VJI88QIW7H4,325825,327659, and other things for decades.
VJI88QIW7H4,327726,329595," They eventually started  making computers,"
VJI88QIW7H4,329662,332831,but they had no concept of the home computer.
VJI88QIW7H4,332898,334967," How are you gonna take  an idea like the computer,"
VJI88QIW7H4,335034,337736," this big room-size  intimidating machine,"
VJI88QIW7H4,337803,339471, and make it  a mainstream thing?
VJI88QIW7H4,339538,342441,"Well, the answer is the microprocessor."
VJI88QIW7H4,342508,344710," Pioneered in the early '70s,  it basically said"
VJI88QIW7H4,344777,346712, we can take the brain  of the computer
VJI88QIW7H4,346779,348814, and shrink it down  to micro-size.
VJI88QIW7H4,348881,352684,"Humphrey:  So that really allows for  smaller, faster,"
VJI88QIW7H4,352751,354052, and much cheaper hardware.
VJI88QIW7H4,354119,355953, And I think Steve Jobs  was such a visionary
VJI88QIW7H4,356021,359024,that he saw where that could go.
VJI88QIW7H4,359091,362060," Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak,"
VJI88QIW7H4,362127,365097,"Ronald Wayne, they were computer hobbyists in a club."
VJI88QIW7H4,365164,368700,"Panitz: In its early days,  Apple was a couple of guys  in a garage"
VJI88QIW7H4,368767,371703,"just kicking around ideas and putting together some, frankly,"
VJI88QIW7H4,371770,373305,pretty janky-looking prototypes.
VJI88QIW7H4,373372,375908,"Humphrey: The Apple I  was their first computer,"
VJI88QIW7H4,375975,378877, and it literally was just  a circuit board.
VJI88QIW7H4,378944,382681,Panitz:  The Apple I looks like a bad  woodshop class in high school.
VJI88QIW7H4,382748,384149,"And companies like HP go,"
VJI88QIW7H4,384216,386452,"""Listen, nobody's ever gonna want that."
VJI88QIW7H4,386519,388454, Computers are for work.  They're for science.
VJI88QIW7H4,388521,390456," They're not for people  in their homes."""
VJI88QIW7H4,390523,392057, Steve Jobs knew  they were wrong.
VJI88QIW7H4,392124,395494,"And from there, he just changed the entire game."
VJI88QIW7H4,395561,397763,Marques:  There were many  personal computers
VJI88QIW7H4,397830,399931," that predated  the 1984 Macintosh,"
VJI88QIW7H4,399999,403134, but what was it that made  the Mac so unique
VJI88QIW7H4,403202,405237, in comparison to  all the rest?
VJI88QIW7H4,405304,406438, Since I've got a lot
VJI88QIW7H4,406505,408707," of computer history  to catch up on,"
VJI88QIW7H4,408774,411610," I asked fellow  YouTube creator iJustine,"
VJI88QIW7H4,411677,413245," who's pretty much  an Apple guru,"
VJI88QIW7H4,413312,414680, to help me out with this.
VJI88QIW7H4,414747,416115, She's reviewed just about  every Apple product
VJI88QIW7H4,416182,419051," of the last decade,  and has been a devoted fan"
VJI88QIW7H4,419118,420953, of the brand  since she was a kid.
VJI88QIW7H4,421020,423754," Today, we're at one of  the biggest tech warehouses  in Brooklyn"
VJI88QIW7H4,423822,426658, so she can show me  what happened  in personal computing
VJI88QIW7H4,426725,430162, between the Apple II  and the 1984 Mac.
VJI88QIW7H4,430229,433031, ( music playing )
VJI88QIW7H4,433098,436535,- I can't believe   this is a real place. - Record players.
VJI88QIW7H4,436602,438904,( gasps )
VJI88QIW7H4,438971,441039,"- Oh, this is-- this is-- - This-- this should have   my name on it."
VJI88QIW7H4,441106,442807,This is Justine's aisle right here.
VJI88QIW7H4,442874,446745,- No way! - I remember my fourth grade   teacher had one of these.
VJI88QIW7H4,446812,449081,"- You could play, like,   cards on it if you were good. - Yeah."
VJI88QIW7H4,449148,452718,I was a few years above that.
VJI88QIW7H4,452785,453953,- But... - And the mice.
VJI88QIW7H4,454020,454919, They've got just about  every piece
VJI88QIW7H4,454987,457856," of retro tech imaginable here,"
VJI88QIW7H4,457923,459758, so what better place  to check out some  of these computers
VJI88QIW7H4,459825,462160, that predated  the original Mac?
VJI88QIW7H4,462227,465030,This looks like all of my latest eBay searches. It's incredible.
VJI88QIW7H4,465097,467666,"I know you as a connoisseur  of all things Apple,"
VJI88QIW7H4,467733,470836,but there's a bunch of other stuff that may have even competed with the Mac here.
VJI88QIW7H4,470903,473972,"Yes. Starting up here, this is the Apple II."
VJI88QIW7H4,474039,477142,So this was around 1977. This was kind of Apple's first introduction...
VJI88QIW7H4,477209,481280,- Marques: The Apple-II.  - ...into creating  the personal computer.
VJI88QIW7H4,481347,483715,"Now, I might need a little help, because I can't reach it,"
VJI88QIW7H4,483782,485083,- but there's an on button. - Is this it?
VJI88QIW7H4,485150,487553,"- Yeah, that's it. - ( whirring )"
VJI88QIW7H4,487620,491123,"- Whoa. - So, obviously, it's probably   seen some better days."
VJI88QIW7H4,491190,492891,- Sure. I'll give it credit   for turning on. - It's there.
VJI88QIW7H4,492958,495260,"But, you know, I mean, back then this was obviously"
VJI88QIW7H4,495327,496528,something that was revolutionary
VJI88QIW7H4,496595,499765,until this over here-- the RadioShack Tandy.
VJI88QIW7H4,499832,502768,"And it's crazy, because this outsold the 1977 Mac"
VJI88QIW7H4,502835,504870, because this was $600.
VJI88QIW7H4,504937,506171,"Marques: If you pop-quizzed me and said,"
VJI88QIW7H4,506238,508173,"""Did RadioShack ever make a computer"
VJI88QIW7H4,508240,510108,"and did it outsell Apple's computer at that time?"","
VJI88QIW7H4,510175,511776,I would have laughed.
VJI88QIW7H4,511844,513745,"Well, it's unfortunately true."
VJI88QIW7H4,513812,516114,Marques: It's also the only thing here
VJI88QIW7H4,516181,517215,that's sort of a space gray color.
VJI88QIW7H4,517281,519016,- Yeah. - I'm a fan of this color.
VJI88QIW7H4,519084,520586,We can turn this one on as well.
VJI88QIW7H4,520653,522621,- Really? - There we go.
VJI88QIW7H4,522688,523789,"I wanted to turn it like it was a knob,"
VJI88QIW7H4,523856,525057,- like a TV or something. - Like a TV.
VJI88QIW7H4,525124,527593,The power button on this and the power button on this
VJI88QIW7H4,527660,530329,are already immensely better than any computer I have now.
VJI88QIW7H4,530396,532264,- Yeah. - The power buttons   on today's computers?
VJI88QIW7H4,532331,535133,"- They don't live up to these. - Then we come down here,"
VJI88QIW7H4,535200,537069,and this is where things kind of get crazy.
VJI88QIW7H4,537136,540739,So this is the first introduction to a personal computer by IBM.
VJI88QIW7H4,540806,543075, This came out around 1981.
VJI88QIW7H4,543142,546211,"IBM was the computer company at that time, so they're huge."
VJI88QIW7H4,546278,548814,Marques: It's got a much more monolithic look.
VJI88QIW7H4,548881,551016,"And IBM was kind of late to get into the, sort of, personal computer..."
VJI88QIW7H4,551083,552918,- Right. - ...because they were mostly   focused on business.
VJI88QIW7H4,552985,555287,This wasn't something they thought was going to be a success.
VJI88QIW7H4,555354,560292,And this is kind of what started the huge conflict with Mac versus PC.
VJI88QIW7H4,560359,563028,- This is it?   There's notably no mouse. - Yeah.
VJI88QIW7H4,563095,564396,And what's crazy is this is the only way that you were able
VJI88QIW7H4,564463,566031,to communicate with your computer-- command lines.
VJI88QIW7H4,566098,569401,- You had to know what to   type to make it work. - Yeah.
VJI88QIW7H4,569468,571703,"It's cool, but it's not very fun."
VJI88QIW7H4,571770,576008,"- Right. - Then next, this is   the Compaq-Portable 286,"
VJI88QIW7H4,576075,577676, and what's nuts about this
VJI88QIW7H4,577743,580078, is this was meant to be  taken places.
VJI88QIW7H4,580145,583015,"There's these little notches right here, so this keyboard actually folds up into this."
VJI88QIW7H4,583082,585016,And there's a luggage handle on the back.
VJI88QIW7H4,585084,586852,Just go take a little look. Just go look.
VJI88QIW7H4,586919,588320,"If you're going to call it portable, you need a handle."
VJI88QIW7H4,588387,591957,"Portable? Um, I'd put that in air quotes for sure."
VJI88QIW7H4,592024,594793,It's like a suitcase.
VJI88QIW7H4,594860,599063,"So, the personal computer from the mega-goliath IBM"
VJI88QIW7H4,599131,600865,"sets, like, waves for the industry."
VJI88QIW7H4,600933,604836,"And then the copycats, they're trying to do things"
VJI88QIW7H4,604903,606938,like be a little cheaper or a little more portable
VJI88QIW7H4,607005,609941,or have their little gimmick that sells them over IBM.
VJI88QIW7H4,610008,613145,"- This was the start   of the clones, so-- - The clone wars."
VJI88QIW7H4,613212,614813,"The clone wars. I mean, it definitely happened,"
VJI88QIW7H4,614880,619718,and that was in sort of this time frame before the 1984 Mac.
VJI88QIW7H4,619785,622920,- That leads us to this. - The Mac.
VJI88QIW7H4,622988,625923,- It's so beautiful. - It's notably smaller
VJI88QIW7H4,625991,628360,"- than the other two by a lot.  - And it's so insane,"
VJI88QIW7H4,628427,632064,because everything was stored on these disks.
VJI88QIW7H4,632131,635901,"So if you wanted to boot the system, you'd have to use the floppy disk."
VJI88QIW7H4,635968,637636,"And then if you wanted to play a game, you'd have to take that out,"
VJI88QIW7H4,637703,640872,"put another disk in. And then if it's like, ""Oh, hold on a second."
VJI88QIW7H4,640939,642708,"I need something back from this system memory,"""
VJI88QIW7H4,642775,644343,- you'd have to swap 'em out. - Yeah.
VJI88QIW7H4,644410,647912,"So it was such a process because it is loading everything into the RAM,"
VJI88QIW7H4,647980,649781,and you obviously don't have a lot of it to work with.
VJI88QIW7H4,649848,652284,"- Not a ton of storage. - And I always will remember,"
VJI88QIW7H4,652351,654886,"I think I was probably in college whenever Apple was like,"
VJI88QIW7H4,654953,657923,"""We are not gonna have a floppy drive in our computers."""
VJI88QIW7H4,657990,660391,"We're like, ""No, what do you mean? We need that."""
VJI88QIW7H4,660459,662160,Apple is kind of known for killing off ports
VJI88QIW7H4,662227,663295,they don't think we need anymore.
VJI88QIW7H4,663361,665430,- Headphone jack? - Headphone jack.
VJI88QIW7H4,665497,668500,- Don't need it.  - Don't really need  that anymore.
VJI88QIW7H4,668567,670135,- FireWire I think  they killed off.  - CD drive.
VJI88QIW7H4,670202,672771,"Marques:  CD drive, they were early  to get rid of that."
VJI88QIW7H4,672838,675373,"- Full size USB.  - Yep, all of it."
VJI88QIW7H4,675440,676875,"But, yeah, floppy drive's another one."
VJI88QIW7H4,676941,679376,Justine: This was one of the first computers with a mouse.
VJI88QIW7H4,679444,681980,There are no arrow keys on this keyboard.
VJI88QIW7H4,682047,684816,"- Oh, right. - That was to force the user   to learn to use the mouse."
VJI88QIW7H4,684883,686016,"And I thought that was something that's really interesting,"
VJI88QIW7H4,686084,687985,"because even though you do use a mouse,"
VJI88QIW7H4,688053,690388,I think those arrow keys are pretty helpful.
VJI88QIW7H4,690455,692457,This may be the first instance of Apple killing off something
VJI88QIW7H4,692524,695092,"- and then bringing   it back later. - Yes, yes."
VJI88QIW7H4,695160,698964,"- Okay, fair. - So we gotta turn it on."
VJI88QIW7H4,699031,701133,"Okay, here we go. I'm gonna give this to you."
VJI88QIW7H4,701200,702968,"Yeah. Oh, there it is."
VJI88QIW7H4,703035,704902,"- It's saying ""no disk."" - Oh, gosh. Okay, hold on."
VJI88QIW7H4,704970,707806,I gotta come around. I gotta see this.
VJI88QIW7H4,707873,710108,"- ""Welcome to Macintosh."" - Look at this."
VJI88QIW7H4,710175,713211,"Looking at this next to the last two computers,"
VJI88QIW7H4,713278,716281,"I mean, green text on a black screen, mouse, UI--"
VJI88QIW7H4,716348,719551,- This 1984 Mac really did   change everything. - Right.
VJI88QIW7H4,719618,722553,It's what made graphical user interface popular.
VJI88QIW7H4,722621,724823,Marques: Dragging something to a trash can
VJI88QIW7H4,724890,728860,is such an obvious mental visual to have.
VJI88QIW7H4,728927,730796,- Yeah. - But that's one of the first   times they do that.
VJI88QIW7H4,730862,735066,"Yeah. I mean, this is essentially the same setup that we currently have now."
VJI88QIW7H4,735133,736401,"- It's a Mac OS. - More or less, yeah."
VJI88QIW7H4,736468,738036,"I mean, you still have that Apple menu up there."
VJI88QIW7H4,738103,741206,"Look at this! Oh, man, I'm freaking out. This is so great."
VJI88QIW7H4,741273,743175,Do you want to try typing on it?
VJI88QIW7H4,743242,746578,"- ( keyboard clacking ) - The sound you get, too,   is, like, kind of unique."
VJI88QIW7H4,746645,749881,( clacking )
VJI88QIW7H4,749948,751917,"- Yeah, it's good. - It's so great."
VJI88QIW7H4,751984,754186,- They don't make 'em   like they used to. - They don't.
VJI88QIW7H4,754253,755554,Marques:  Now that I've seen
VJI88QIW7H4,755621,758490," some of the Macintosh's  competitors firsthand,"
VJI88QIW7H4,758557,761860," I want to know  how did Apple take on  its biggest threat,"
VJI88QIW7H4,761927,764229, computer giant IBM?
VJI88QIW7H4,764296,767566,"Back then, Apple was still the little David company versus the Goliath."
VJI88QIW7H4,767633,769234,"Newscaster:  Industry analysts  predicted that Apple,"
VJI88QIW7H4,769301,771169," like many other  smaller companies,"
VJI88QIW7H4,771236,772471, would be forced out  of business.
VJI88QIW7H4,772537,775073,I think Steve Jobs enjoyed being the underdog.
VJI88QIW7H4,775140,779177,I think Apple is the only thing standing between them
VJI88QIW7H4,779244,780812,and total industry dominance.
VJI88QIW7H4,780879,782147,"Humphrey:  So Steve Jobs and the rest  of their crew,"
VJI88QIW7H4,782214,784750, they knew they were going to  have to come up
VJI88QIW7H4,784816,786852, with something spectacular  to put a dent in the universe.
VJI88QIW7H4,786919,789187,"I was the Creative Director of Apple for,"
VJI88QIW7H4,789254,791289,"like, 17 years altogether."
VJI88QIW7H4,791356,793258,There were a number of things about working with Steve.
VJI88QIW7H4,793325,796928,"First thing was he was smart. And I mean, like, really smart."
VJI88QIW7H4,796995,799063, But what really set him apart
VJI88QIW7H4,799131,800966, was the marketing  side of him.
VJI88QIW7H4,801033,802301, I've worked with  many big companies.
VJI88QIW7H4,802368,805503, I've never met a CEO  who had that passion
VJI88QIW7H4,805570,807939, and talent for marketing.
VJI88QIW7H4,808006,809975,He knew that every product had to tell a story.
VJI88QIW7H4,810042,812477,Humphrey:  So Apple created a commercial.
VJI88QIW7H4,812544,815247," It was in, I think,  the third quarter  of the Super Bowl,"
VJI88QIW7H4,815314,818316,so you had all of the eyeballs of America on this thing.
VJI88QIW7H4,818383,821953, They got Ridley Scott  of all people to direct  this commercial.
VJI88QIW7H4,822020,825257,"Ackerman:  It was a takeoff  on George Orwell's ""1984."""
VJI88QIW7H4,825324,827925,"Humphrey:  There was Big Brother  out there watching you,"
VJI88QIW7H4,827993,830495,and they sort of likened IBM to Big Brother.
VJI88QIW7H4,830562,833164,"Ackerman:  And this woman comes in  running in slow motion,"
VJI88QIW7H4,833231,836001," swinging the hammer,  throws it against the screen  and shatters it..."
VJI88QIW7H4,836068,838436,( explosion )
VJI88QIW7H4,838503,840272,"...freeing you from the IBM,"
VJI88QIW7H4,840339,843341,the International Business Machine's slog.
VJI88QIW7H4,843408,845110,"Announcer:  On January 24th,"
VJI88QIW7H4,845177,848446, Apple Computer  will introduce Macintosh.
VJI88QIW7H4,848513,854286," And you'll see why 1984  won't be like ""1984."""
VJI88QIW7H4,854353,855721,Good evening.
VJI88QIW7H4,855788,856822,Marques: Soon after  that commercial aired...
VJI88QIW7H4,856889,857889,I'm Steve Jobs from Apple Computer.
VJI88QIW7H4,857957,860191,We're very glad to be here tonight.
VJI88QIW7H4,860258,861391," ...Steve Jobs took the stage,"
VJI88QIW7H4,861459,863527, ready to unveil  his latest creation
VJI88QIW7H4,863595,866131, to an excited crowd  of onlookers.
VJI88QIW7H4,866198,868934,"Panitz:  The anticipation of what  was gonna come out,"
VJI88QIW7H4,869001,872136,it was like Halloween wrapped into Christmas
VJI88QIW7H4,872204,873404,wrapped into my birthday.
VJI88QIW7H4,873472,876407,The original unveiling of the first Macintosh
VJI88QIW7H4,876475,878076,was once of those Steve moments.
VJI88QIW7H4,878143,879144,What I'd like to do now
VJI88QIW7H4,879211,880946,is show you the Macintosh in person.
VJI88QIW7H4,881013,883649,Segall:  He was a master showman.
VJI88QIW7H4,890689,894326,( cheering )
VJI88QIW7H4,894393,895627, It was all so human.
VJI88QIW7H4,895694,898496,Having the computer introduce itself
VJI88QIW7H4,898563,901266," was Steve's big moment to say,  ""We're different."""
VJI88QIW7H4,901333,906104,"Marques: The 1984 Mac  was different than everything  else at the time,"
VJI88QIW7H4,906171,910241, but it was still limited  compared to what we have now.
VJI88QIW7H4,910308,912544," There wasn't much  internal storage on the Mac,"
VJI88QIW7H4,912611,914512, but it left room for  third party developers
VJI88QIW7H4,914579,917315, to create a multitude  of software.
VJI88QIW7H4,917382,920518,So I've invited a special guest  to test some of it out.
VJI88QIW7H4,920585,923588,"128k, people."
VJI88QIW7H4,923655,926091,And K stands for... kilobyte?
VJI88QIW7H4,926158,928259,- Yes. - Okay. Okay.
VJI88QIW7H4,928326,929527,- Jeez. - Got it.
VJI88QIW7H4,929594,931396,Kids today.
VJI88QIW7H4,931463,933531,"Marques:  Back when I was  in elementary school,"
VJI88QIW7H4,933598,935700," the science teacher would roll  the TV into the classroom,"
VJI88QIW7H4,935767,939137, and we'd get lessons from  Bill Nye the Science Guy.
VJI88QIW7H4,939204,942373,"So, computers count with binary bits."
VJI88QIW7H4,942441,945477, So who better to help me learn  about the 1984 Mac
VJI88QIW7H4,945544,948146, other than Bill Nye himself?
VJI88QIW7H4,948213,949647,"So, Bill, I'll play a little game"
VJI88QIW7H4,949714,951649,"that I call ""Dope Or Nope."""
VJI88QIW7H4,951716,955487,"""Dope or Nope."" Nope, nope, nope."
VJI88QIW7H4,955554,957555,"So, the original Mac came with original software,"
VJI88QIW7H4,957622,959691,"but then, of course, several came out since then."
VJI88QIW7H4,959758,963061,We're gonna go through some of those pieces of software
VJI88QIW7H4,963128,965162,"and the first one's called ""Earth Plot."""
VJI88QIW7H4,965230,969401,"- ""Earth Plot."" - Okay, we pick a latitude   and longitude,"
VJI88QIW7H4,969468,972637,and it's gonna kind of Google Earth-style just make a map.
VJI88QIW7H4,972704,975040,"So, do you have a favorite latitude and longitude?"
VJI88QIW7H4,975107,978276,"Well, Los Angeles is at-- uh, may I click?"
VJI88QIW7H4,978343,980311,- Do I just do this?   What happened? - I think it's just a slider.
VJI88QIW7H4,980378,981846,"- Oh, yeah, yeah. - You knew to hold   the mouse down"
VJI88QIW7H4,981913,984482,"- and then release on   the menu item? - Yeah, yeah."
VJI88QIW7H4,984549,986451,"- When did that change? - I don't know, man."
VJI88QIW7H4,986518,988386,- Okay. - That was deep within me.
VJI88QIW7H4,988453,989654,"- Yeah, you just knew. - Whoa."
VJI88QIW7H4,989721,991189,"- Muscle memory. - Yeah, it's muscle memory."
VJI88QIW7H4,991256,995459,- Huh. - You see that?   It's plotting North America.
VJI88QIW7H4,995527,996828,- So you can probably   zoom back in. - But how gorgeous.
VJI88QIW7H4,996895,998830,Look at that. This is-- this is dope.
VJI88QIW7H4,998897,1001433,- And it's taking more time. - Yeah.
VJI88QIW7H4,1001500,1006071,- This is so dope. - I'm gonna give   the loading time a nope.
VJI88QIW7H4,1006138,1009107,- But the final result? - I'm saying this is dope.
VJI88QIW7H4,1009174,1012644,"You can be critical of the time, but this is 35 years ago."
VJI88QIW7H4,1012711,1015513,"Yeah. So, you know, they did their best, people."
VJI88QIW7H4,1015580,1017182,"- But look at that, man. - There it is."
VJI88QIW7H4,1017248,1020584,- That is dope. - The full Earth.   This is definitely dope.
VJI88QIW7H4,1020652,1024121,- This is so dope. - I'm gonna quit and open   the next thing.
VJI88QIW7H4,1024188,1027626,"- Cool, yeah.   Earth's plotted out. - Plotted it."
VJI88QIW7H4,1029928,1032663,"- All right, this is ""Asteroid."" - Yeah, ""Asteroids,"" plural."
VJI88QIW7H4,1032730,1035600,"- Oh, there you go.   ""Asteroids."" - Yeah."
VJI88QIW7H4,1035667,1037635,"So you click it, and then here come the asteroids,"
VJI88QIW7H4,1037702,1040371,"and you gotta, you know, break 'em apart so things don't go wrong."
VJI88QIW7H4,1040438,1044141,"- How do I move? - The world's gonna end, dude!   Come on."
VJI88QIW7H4,1044209,1047145,"I didn't move at all. Wait, I don't know how to move my, uh..."
VJI88QIW7H4,1047212,1049614,"- There you go.   You got it to rotate. - Z and X, okay."
VJI88QIW7H4,1049681,1052484,- Z and X are my rotation. - ( beeps )
VJI88QIW7H4,1052551,1056488,"- Oh, you got yourself blasted. - The physics of this   are fascinating."
VJI88QIW7H4,1056555,1059224,"- Okay. I think I can--   oh, oh, oh, oh! - There you go."
VJI88QIW7H4,1059291,1061226,It's just eating us alive. There you go.
VJI88QIW7H4,1061293,1063328,- I'm gonna spin you around   and get this one right here. - I'm spinning around.
VJI88QIW7H4,1063395,1064630,How about that move? How about that move?
VJI88QIW7H4,1064696,1066631,"Get some of that. Get some of that, asteroid."
VJI88QIW7H4,1066698,1068766,"With practice, it wouldn't take two people."
VJI88QIW7H4,1068833,1071436,- Take me down there. Yes. - There it is.
VJI88QIW7H4,1071503,1074539,"- 2,080? Oh, killing it. - 2,080 for just one thing."
VJI88QIW7H4,1074606,1076674,"Killing it. I think ""Asteroids"" is dope, right off the bat."
VJI88QIW7H4,1076741,1078242,I think it's dope. I think it's so dope.
VJI88QIW7H4,1078309,1079377,"- I got no problem   with ""Asteroids."" - I'm doping up."
VJI88QIW7H4,1079444,1080612,- That was awesome. - So here's the floppy.
VJI88QIW7H4,1080678,1083247,So what I have to do to start the next one
VJI88QIW7H4,1083315,1085149,is I have to get rid of this floppy and start the next one?
VJI88QIW7H4,1085217,1087752,- Cha-chunk it. - I have to cha-chunk it?
VJI88QIW7H4,1087819,1090320,Do you know how to get back to the main screen from here?
VJI88QIW7H4,1090388,1092824,"Well, you gotta eject and it's not ejecting."
VJI88QIW7H4,1092891,1095460,"Now, what we would have to do,"
VJI88QIW7H4,1095527,1096895,and I'm not saying-- see this hole?
VJI88QIW7H4,1096962,1100198,"- Mm-hmm. - You would take   a bent paper clip,"

VJI88QIW7H4,1102334,1105703,"but that seems like a catastrophic move, doesn't it?"
VJI88QIW7H4,1105770,1109240,"Yeah, there's gotta be a way."
VJI88QIW7H4,1109307,1111476,So does anybody have a paper clip?
VJI88QIW7H4,1111543,1116180, ( music playing )
VJI88QIW7H4,1116248,1120185,"So, teach a man to fish-- gently push it in this hole."
VJI88QIW7H4,1120252,1121954,- Gently. - ( clicks )
VJI88QIW7H4,1122020,1123855,"- Oh, I had to go-- okay,   all right, all right. - There you go."
VJI88QIW7H4,1123922,1126324,"But still, that was a catastrophic failure."
VJI88QIW7H4,1126391,1128693,I think we want to cycle the power off.
VJI88QIW7H4,1128760,1131396,"- Off. - And then let that CRT,"
VJI88QIW7H4,1131463,1135700,that cathode ray tube shut itself down.
VJI88QIW7H4,1135767,1138469,Let the electronics drain.
VJI88QIW7H4,1138536,1141573,"- Drain, man. - ( Marques chuckles )"
VJI88QIW7H4,1141640,1144742,"- ( beeps )  - Three, two."
VJI88QIW7H4,1144809,1147878,- Look how happy he or she is. - That is adorable.
VJI88QIW7H4,1147946,1149948,It's adorbs. Totally adorbs.
VJI88QIW7H4,1150015,1153284,"Marques: Okay, the last one is ""Mac Surgeon."""
VJI88QIW7H4,1153351,1156888,"All right, ""Mac Surgeon."" What do you want? Body parts? And here we go."
VJI88QIW7H4,1156955,1160857,"""Mr. Thomas Jones, a 65-year-old-man with a history of heart problems,"
VJI88QIW7H4,1160925,1162727,came in with problems of lower back pain.
VJI88QIW7H4,1162794,1164762,You thought he felt a pulsating mass in the abdomen.
VJI88QIW7H4,1164829,1167999,"You ordered X-rays of the abdomen. They showed nothing."""
VJI88QIW7H4,1168066,1170602,- I think we gotta order   an ultrasonic. - That's the spine?

VJI88QIW7H4,1173538,1176341,"- This was how we rolled, man. - Oh, my goodness."
VJI88QIW7H4,1176408,1179476,It was not the good old days. It was the old days.
VJI88QIW7H4,1179544,1183314,- Let's operate. - Let's operate. Sure.
VJI88QIW7H4,1183381,1184749,- He's got a tear. - Let's make an incision.
VJI88QIW7H4,1184816,1186551,"- Where? Right about here? - Yeah, right up the center."
VJI88QIW7H4,1186618,1189554,- Oh. There you go. - There it goes. Went around   the belly button.
VJI88QIW7H4,1189621,1192624,Pressure's now a hundred-- then what are we doing?
VJI88QIW7H4,1192691,1194626,Marques: How realistic is-- are we sewing this back up?
VJI88QIW7H4,1194693,1197629,I guess so. I'm really not sure what we're doing.
VJI88QIW7H4,1197696,1199897,"Ooh, this one. This is a needle and thread."
VJI88QIW7H4,1199964,1202767,Okay. His blood pressure's dropping.
VJI88QIW7H4,1202834,1205370,"- He'll be fine. - Well, okay. You may be right."
VJI88QIW7H4,1205437,1207872,"- Marques: What? - He's bleeding like crazy, man."
VJI88QIW7H4,1207939,1211309,"- Uh, maybe he's not   doing so good. - ( flatline )"
VJI88QIW7H4,1211376,1212444,"""I'm sorry, doctor. The patient's heart has stopped."""
VJI88QIW7H4,1212510,1216447,You say that like that's a big deal.

VJI88QIW7H4,1218850,1221686,- But it's quite troubling. - So where are you at   on this one?
VJI88QIW7H4,1221753,1224956,- I think this has   potential for dope. - On the nope or dope scale?
VJI88QIW7H4,1225023,1227424,But I'd have to spend a lot more time.
VJI88QIW7H4,1227492,1229861,This seems like one that has a bit of a higher learning curve.
VJI88QIW7H4,1229928,1232497,Yes. Higher learning curve.
VJI88QIW7H4,1232564,1236668,- Yeah. I'm gonna   give this a nope. - Yes!
VJI88QIW7H4,1236735,1239337,"So, I appreciate you helping out with the Dope Or Nope segment."
VJI88QIW7H4,1239404,1241206,I'm learning a lot about the original Mac.
VJI88QIW7H4,1241273,1244376,- This has been a lot of fun.   Appreciate it. - Let's change the world.
VJI88QIW7H4,1249047,1250515,Marques:  Steve Jobs knew that in order
VJI88QIW7H4,1250582,1253551," to differentiate the Macintosh  from its competitors,"
VJI88QIW7H4,1253618,1255520, he'd need to get it  on the radar
VJI88QIW7H4,1255587,1259524," of both the tech crowd  and the ""it"" crowd."
VJI88QIW7H4,1259591,1262360,Humphrey:  Steve Jobs really did  a great job
VJI88QIW7H4,1262427,1264729,of getting Macintosh into the hands of influencers.
VJI88QIW7H4,1264796,1268499, He gifted it  to John Lennon's son Sean.
VJI88QIW7H4,1268566,1270868," And then Andy Warhol  got his hands on one,"
VJI88QIW7H4,1270935,1274605, and actually ended up  using it in one of his  art installations.
VJI88QIW7H4,1274672,1276107, Steve Jobs created that buzz
VJI88QIW7H4,1276174,1278443," because if  the cool people like it,"
VJI88QIW7H4,1278510,1280278,"then, of course, everybody's gonna like it."
VJI88QIW7H4,1280345,1283013,Ackerman:  The Macintosh really conquered  the popular conception
VJI88QIW7H4,1283081,1284282, of what a computer should be.
VJI88QIW7H4,1284349,1285717," And they said,  ""We're gonna make sure"
VJI88QIW7H4,1285784,1286952, you have the software tools  that you need most
VJI88QIW7H4,1287018,1289721," so you're gonna buy  our machine."""
VJI88QIW7H4,1289788,1291756, Here's MacWrite.  Here's MacPaint.
VJI88QIW7H4,1291823,1294959,"When MacPaint came out, it allowed creatives"
VJI88QIW7H4,1295026,1298730, to make what they do  orders of magnitude easier.
VJI88QIW7H4,1298797,1301866," So you really only need  your own creativity,"
VJI88QIW7H4,1301933,1304135, and it's absolutely  a straight line to Photoshop.
VJI88QIW7H4,1304202,1305803,It all started with MacPaint.

VJI88QIW7H4,1310475,1313010, are still using  MacPaint today.
VJI88QIW7H4,1313077,1315713," Many of his works  have gone viral,"
VJI88QIW7H4,1315780,1318649," like his animation  of Donald Glover's  ""This is America."""

VJI88QIW7H4,1329694,1331062,"super detailed, like, individual pixels."
VJI88QIW7H4,1331129,1332898,Yeah...
VJI88QIW7H4,1333998,1335000,Marques: Whoa.
VJI88QIW7H4,1337135,1338570,Yeah.
VJI88QIW7H4,1339671,1341873,"Wow, that's crazy."
VJI88QIW7H4,1341940,1344674,Why continue to use this computer
VJI88QIW7H4,1344742,1347346,versus all the crazy modern stuff we have available now?
VJI88QIW7H4,1359157,1360592,I'm a terrible artist.

VJI88QIW7H4,1373605,1376041,- Yeah. - So everything they do is sort   of revolutionary in a way.
VJI88QIW7H4,1377242,1378809,Let me put the finishing touches on this.
VJI88QIW7H4,1380612,1382046,"I mean, I drew a whole tree, and you can--"
VJI88QIW7H4,1382113,1383548,can you tell it's a tree?
VJI88QIW7H4,1390154,1394058,I appreciate how generous you're being about my drawing.
VJI88QIW7H4,1394125,1397762,- ( laughing ) - I sent you a video   not too long ago...
VJI88QIW7H4,1397829,1399197,- Mm-hmm. - ...with a little bit   of movement in it.
VJI88QIW7H4,1399264,1401199,This is that video.
VJI88QIW7H4,1401266,1404735,"And you had some time to make an animated version of it,"
VJI88QIW7H4,1404802,1407906,- which I'm super excited   to possibly see. - Yeah.
VJI88QIW7H4,1418216,1421152,Marques: And it would kind of be the first animation software
VJI88QIW7H4,1421219,1422987,anyone could get their hands on...
VJI88QIW7H4,1423054,1425823,- Yeah. - ...as far as personal   hobbyist animation.
VJI88QIW7H4,1425890,1427426,"Yeah, yeah."
VJI88QIW7H4,1432697,1434499,Look at that. That's so good.
VJI88QIW7H4,1438670,1440205,- ( laughter ) - Yeah.
VJI88QIW7H4,1452116,1453552,"Wait, I gotta look back at the video now."
VJI88QIW7H4,1456621,1459558,Yeah. The amount of pixels being held next to each other.
VJI88QIW7H4,1460725,1462961,"Yeah, thank you."

VJI88QIW7H4,1476941,1480912,The legacy of the Macintosh is the fact that
VJI88QIW7H4,1480979,1485149, Steve Jobs was able to put a computer in all of our homes.

VJI88QIW7H4,1498730,1500898," Something that's useful,  but very personal,"
VJI88QIW7H4,1500965,1502934, and you make that choice  based on how you feel

VJI88QIW7H4,1508006,1510207," not only changed the way  we use computers,"
VJI88QIW7H4,1510274,1513778,but also has pigeonholed the computer industry
VJI88QIW7H4,1513845,1516580, into just doing what they do.
VJI88QIW7H4,1516648,1519049,"It was the human technology company,"

VJI88QIW7H4,1552917,1555119, and the vision behind it.  It's pretty incredible.
