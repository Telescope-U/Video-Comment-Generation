Z1hch9COSOU,640,4480,the weirdest medieval sports
Z1hch9COSOU,4560,6560,in the dreamworks movie the road to el
Z1hch9COSOU,6560,8559,dorado we see the two main characters
Z1hch9COSOU,8559,10000,playing a ball game against their
Z1hch9COSOU,10000,12400,mesoamerican hosts that involves trying
Z1hch9COSOU,12400,14400,to shoot balls through a hoop high up on
Z1hch9COSOU,14400,16720,the side of a wall the game continues
Z1hch9COSOU,16720,18560,all day until the sun's shadow reaches
Z1hch9COSOU,18560,20800,the bottom step of the temple
Z1hch9COSOU,20800,22880,but what you might not know is that this
Z1hch9COSOU,22880,25199,was based on real mesoamerican ball
Z1hch9COSOU,25199,28640,games played from 1650 bce up to around
Z1hch9COSOU,28640,30880,1600 ce
Z1hch9COSOU,30880,32960,while there were numerous variations
Z1hch9COSOU,32960,34559,surviving bosses from the mayan
Z1hch9COSOU,34559,36640,civilization often showed players with
Z1hch9COSOU,36640,39040,painted faces and bumping the balls with
Z1hch9COSOU,39040,40800,their hips to score
Z1hch9COSOU,40800,42800,while this game sounds like a lot of fun
Z1hch9COSOU,42800,45200,it represents only one of many truly
Z1hch9COSOU,45200,46800,unique sports to emerge from the
Z1hch9COSOU,46800,48800,medieval era let's take a look at some
Z1hch9COSOU,48800,51120,today
Z1hch9COSOU,51360,54559,army mock battles and tournaments
Z1hch9COSOU,54559,56719,as a type of sport the tournament
Z1hch9COSOU,56719,58800,emerged in popularity on the european
Z1hch9COSOU,58800,61280,continent in the early 12th century
Z1hch9COSOU,61280,63840,the armies of normandy england often
Z1hch9COSOU,63840,66159,took part in mock battles in order to
Z1hch9COSOU,66159,68320,prepare for the real thing and to make
Z1hch9COSOU,68320,69840,it more fun they turned the whole
Z1hch9COSOU,69840,72799,occasion into a sport basically it was a
Z1hch9COSOU,72799,75360,lot like modern day larping
Z1hch9COSOU,75360,76960,these battles were also one of the few
Z1hch9COSOU,76960,79040,ways that landless piers and knights
Z1hch9COSOU,79040,81119,could rise through the social hierarchy
Z1hch9COSOU,81119,83280,through displays of skill and strength
Z1hch9COSOU,83280,85119,in the mock fights
Z1hch9COSOU,85119,86960,like a real battle there were a few
Z1hch9COSOU,86960,88720,rules and so it often gradually
Z1hch9COSOU,88720,91040,descended into organized chaos with
Z1hch9COSOU,91040,93600,subterfuge and shady tactics on both
Z1hch9COSOU,93600,94640,sides
Z1hch9COSOU,94640,96560,knights could be injured or even killed
Z1hch9COSOU,96560,98479,in these displays
Z1hch9COSOU,98479,100640,by the 13th century these mock battles
Z1hch9COSOU,100640,102799,had become even more elaborate dramatic
Z1hch9COSOU,102799,105520,affairs moving from open fields to town
Z1hch9COSOU,105520,106640,centers
Z1hch9COSOU,106640,109280,in 1331 for example the cheapside
Z1hch9COSOU,109280,112159,tournament took place edward iii and his
Z1hch9COSOU,112159,114320,favorite knights dressed as tartars and
Z1hch9COSOU,114320,117119,led their ladies using silver chains
Z1hch9COSOU,117119,119439,mock battles were turning into more like
Z1hch9COSOU,119439,121520,festivals where individual knights would
Z1hch9COSOU,121520,124000,showcase over-the-top elaborate heroics
Z1hch9COSOU,124000,126240,for the benefit of the crowd
Z1hch9COSOU,126240,128080,by the middle of the 15th century the
Z1hch9COSOU,128080,130080,mock battles were less reminiscent of
Z1hch9COSOU,130080,132319,warfare and more reminiscent of a stage
Z1hch9COSOU,132319,133280,play
Z1hch9COSOU,133280,135200,the sport had become a theatrical
Z1hch9COSOU,135200,137760,performance often involving story lines
Z1hch9COSOU,137760,141440,costumes and audience interaction
Z1hch9COSOU,141440,144400,falconry or hawking
Z1hch9COSOU,144400,146720,the medieval upper class like to display
Z1hch9COSOU,146720,149520,their wealth in any way possible not too
Z1hch9COSOU,149520,151760,different from today's upper class
Z1hch9COSOU,151760,153840,one way they did this was by acquiring
Z1hch9COSOU,153840,156959,expensive falcons and other noble birds
Z1hch9COSOU,156959,159280,including peregrines lanners and various
Z1hch9COSOU,159280,161519,species of hawk to use in the sport of
Z1hch9COSOU,161519,164480,falconry or hawking the richer the noble
Z1hch9COSOU,164480,166800,the more of these birds they may possess
Z1hch9COSOU,166800,168800,they required extensive training before
Z1hch9COSOU,168800,170879,they were allowed to fly sending them to
Z1hch9COSOU,170879,172959,track and kill specific prey as the
Z1hch9COSOU,172959,175680,humans galloped along below taking part
Z1hch9COSOU,175680,178239,in more of a spectator sport fashion
Z1hch9COSOU,178239,180159,of course the winning bird would lead to
Z1hch9COSOU,180159,182800,praise heaped upon the owner as if they
Z1hch9COSOU,182800,184400,had personally killed the prey
Z1hch9COSOU,184400,186560,themselves
Z1hch9COSOU,186560,188159,tennis
Z1hch9COSOU,188159,191120,we all know tennis a court a ball and
Z1hch9COSOU,191120,193280,two to four players with a racket each
Z1hch9COSOU,193280,194720,but did you know that way back in the
Z1hch9COSOU,194720,196959,15th century tennis used to be a far
Z1hch9COSOU,196959,200239,more painful and weird sport
Z1hch9COSOU,200239,202159,a favorite among the french elite and
Z1hch9COSOU,202159,204239,bourgeois tennis was similar to the
Z1hch9COSOU,204239,206799,version we have today only tennis balls
Z1hch9COSOU,206799,208959,weren't quite as fancy as they are now
Z1hch9COSOU,208959,211040,and were just usually pieces of cloth
Z1hch9COSOU,211040,213200,packed tightly and sowed
Z1hch9COSOU,213200,215440,this version of early tennis originated
Z1hch9COSOU,215440,217599,in monasteries and villages in southern
Z1hch9COSOU,217599,220319,france way back in the 11th century
Z1hch9COSOU,220319,222799,originally they called it je de pomme
Z1hch9COSOU,222799,225120,literally translating to game of the
Z1hch9COSOU,225120,227200,palm that's because instead of the
Z1hch9COSOU,227200,228959,rackets players would use their own
Z1hch9COSOU,228959,231280,hands imagine literally smacking the
Z1hch9COSOU,231280,234959,ball with your open hand ouch
Z1hch9COSOU,234959,236720,this video was brought to you by
Z1hch9COSOU,236720,239040,established titles instead of being
Z1hch9COSOU,239040,241280,treated like a lord do you often feel
Z1hch9COSOU,241280,243599,more like the court jester historically
Z1hch9COSOU,243599,245439,in the beautiful highlands of scotland
Z1hch9COSOU,245439,247840,anyone who owned land was called a laird
Z1hch9COSOU,247840,250319,lord or lady regardless if they presided
Z1hch9COSOU,250319,252400,over one square foot of grass or acres
Z1hch9COSOU,252400,254959,of ground ripe for a mock battle and

Z1hch9COSOU,262240,264960,a true member of the gentry every title
Z1hch9COSOU,264960,266880,pack gives you at least one square foot
Z1hch9COSOU,266880,268800,of dedicated land that you can call your

Z1hch9COSOU,308240,310639,simple history today
Z1hch9COSOU,310639,313360,icelandic horse fights
Z1hch9COSOU,313360,315919,in iceland a popular but rather weird
Z1hch9COSOU,315919,317600,sport took place throughout the medieval
Z1hch9COSOU,317600,319360,period all the way up to the 17th
Z1hch9COSOU,319360,322000,century horse fighting or as the
Z1hch9COSOU,322000,325199,icelandic people called it gestaviv
Z1hch9COSOU,325199,327039,what we know of horse fighting mainly
Z1hch9COSOU,327039,329440,comes from offhand remarks in the epic
Z1hch9COSOU,329440,331840,icelandic sagas making it difficult to
Z1hch9COSOU,331840,334800,know quite how exactly it took place
Z1hch9COSOU,334800,336479,it appears that they most commonly took
Z1hch9COSOU,336479,338479,place between summer and early autumn
Z1hch9COSOU,338479,340639,according to one source and were usually
Z1hch9COSOU,340639,343440,between two stallions of good breeding
Z1hch9COSOU,343440,345360,horse fighting could only occur if both
Z1hch9COSOU,345360,347440,owners consented they would then send
Z1hch9COSOU,347440,349520,invitations out across the district with
Z1hch9COSOU,349520,351520,many turning up to spectate
Z1hch9COSOU,351520,353120,the whole thing would be turned into a
Z1hch9COSOU,353120,355120,big event with people setting up food
Z1hch9COSOU,355120,356880,and drink stalls and other forms of
Z1hch9COSOU,356880,358560,entertainment
Z1hch9COSOU,358560,360880,for the horse fight itself usually a
Z1hch9COSOU,360880,362800,nearby paddock would be cleared so
Z1hch9COSOU,362800,364639,people could easily gather and watch the
Z1hch9COSOU,364639,365600,action
Z1hch9COSOU,365600,367680,sometimes like modern wrestlers they'd
Z1hch9COSOU,367680,369759,place the horses in categories like
Z1hch9COSOU,369759,371919,young stallions to decide which would go
Z1hch9COSOU,371919,373680,up against which
Z1hch9COSOU,373680,376240,then finally the horses would fight the
Z1hch9COSOU,376240,377759,owners of the horses would choose a
Z1hch9COSOU,377759,379840,helper called their second to be in the
Z1hch9COSOU,379840,382160,paddock with the horses on their behalf
Z1hch9COSOU,382160,383840,the owners would then prod them with
Z1hch9COSOU,383840,385520,sticks or staffs that would cause the
Z1hch9COSOU,385520,387680,horses to rear up and clash against each
Z1hch9COSOU,387680,389759,other in a vicious battle of hooves and
Z1hch9COSOU,389759,390639,teeth
Z1hch9COSOU,390639,392800,it could last for hours until one of the
Z1hch9COSOU,392800,394560,horses either collapsed due to
Z1hch9COSOU,394560,396880,exhaustion or succumbed to its injuries
Z1hch9COSOU,396880,399199,and died at which point the spectators
Z1hch9COSOU,399199,401280,would cheer and celebrate because who
Z1hch9COSOU,401280,404240,doesn't love beating a dead horse
Z1hch9COSOU,404240,406160,cannot liquor
Z1hch9COSOU,406160,408720,cannot like was a norse ball game played
Z1hch9COSOU,408720,411039,from antiquity to the middle ages it
Z1hch9COSOU,411039,413440,involved a ball a stick and seemed to be
Z1hch9COSOU,413440,415599,usually played on a field of ice
Z1hch9COSOU,415599,417120,although there are reports of it being
Z1hch9COSOU,417120,419199,played in summer too suggesting it
Z1hch9COSOU,419199,420880,didn't have to be icy for the game to
Z1hch9COSOU,420880,424000,commence what we know of knotlikker
Z1hch9COSOU,424000,426240,comes from epic sagas so how the game
Z1hch9COSOU,426240,428800,was played exactly has been lost but we
Z1hch9COSOU,428800,431520,can ascertain it was played one-on-one
Z1hch9COSOU,431520,433840,or involved many players and like a lot
Z1hch9COSOU,433840,435919,of things in the medieval era was often
Z1hch9COSOU,435919,438160,reduced to violence
Z1hch9COSOU,438160,440800,many historians such as ebe herzberg and
Z1hch9COSOU,440800,443199,bjorn bjarnassen liken it to lacrosse
Z1hch9COSOU,443199,445360,with a stick used to catch and hurl the
Z1hch9COSOU,445360,447039,small hard ball
Z1hch9COSOU,447039,448720,there are many descriptions of players
Z1hch9COSOU,448720,450720,deliberately aiming for each other and
Z1hch9COSOU,450720,453280,causing bruises or injuries suggesting
Z1hch9COSOU,453280,455039,it was most likely played with a ball
Z1hch9COSOU,455039,458319,made from wood or tightly packed leather
Z1hch9COSOU,458319,460000,generally there didn't seem to be a huge
Z1hch9COSOU,460000,462319,amount of rules to cannot decker instead
Z1hch9COSOU,462319,464240,it seemed popular to throw the ball with
Z1hch9COSOU,464240,466240,the aim of hurting the opposing player
Z1hch9COSOU,466240,468319,and allowing the game to quickly devolve
Z1hch9COSOU,468319,470240,into a violent wrestling match where
Z1hch9COSOU,470240,472560,everyone walked away bruised
Z1hch9COSOU,472560,474960,in true icelandic fashion the entire
Z1hch9COSOU,474960,477599,time spectators would watch drink and
Z1hch9COSOU,477599,479520,holler at the players and even get
Z1hch9COSOU,479520,483199,involved in the brawls themselves
Z1hch9COSOU,483199,486639,naval tourneys or naval jousting
Z1hch9COSOU,486639,488560,jousting is the most famous of all
Z1hch9COSOU,488560,490879,medieval sports it involves two nights
Z1hch9COSOU,490879,492800,on horseback galloping towards each
Z1hch9COSOU,492800,494960,other with long lances each attempting
Z1hch9COSOU,494960,497599,to unhorse their opponent but what is
Z1hch9COSOU,497599,499360,less known is that there was a naval
Z1hch9COSOU,499360,501039,version of jousting
Z1hch9COSOU,501039,502879,as described by thomas beckett's
Z1hch9COSOU,502879,505360,biographer william fitzsteven naval
Z1hch9COSOU,505360,506960,tornies were very similar to the
Z1hch9COSOU,506960,509280,jousting we all know and love but played
Z1hch9COSOU,509280,511440,on the water instead
Z1hch9COSOU,511440,513760,in one format two opposing players would
Z1hch9COSOU,513760,515760,face off in small vessels holding a
Z1hch9COSOU,515760,518240,lance a shield would stand in the middle
Z1hch9COSOU,518240,520320,of the river on a post and the player
Z1hch9COSOU,520320,521599,would attempt to hit it without
Z1hch9COSOU,521599,523360,splintering his lance
Z1hch9COSOU,523360,525440,if he failed he'd be thrown off by the
Z1hch9COSOU,525440,527680,weight of his own hit and usually end up
Z1hch9COSOU,527680,529920,falling and emerging down river coughing
Z1hch9COSOU,529920,531760,and sputtering
Z1hch9COSOU,531760,533600,in another format similar to the
Z1hch9COSOU,533600,535680,classical rules two opponents would
Z1hch9COSOU,535680,537519,joust against one another from the bow
Z1hch9COSOU,537519,539600,of a small vessel with the intention of
Z1hch9COSOU,539600,541200,sending the other crashing into the
Z1hch9COSOU,541200,542480,water
Z1hch9COSOU,542480,544399,in either circumstance it seems like the
Z1hch9COSOU,544399,546399,people prepared for this eventuality
Z1hch9COSOU,546399,548800,with watchers poised in boats ready to
Z1hch9COSOU,548800,550640,snatch up any of the submerged
Z1hch9COSOU,550640,552959,competitors as soon as they appeared
Z1hch9COSOU,552959,555959,downstream
