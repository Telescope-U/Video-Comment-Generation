D45kcWgVJ7s,137680,139200,countries but it seems that they've come
D45kcWgVJ7s,139200,140879,to an agreement and that they're going
D45kcWgVJ7s,140879,143440,to move forward uh there's at least an
D45kcWgVJ7s,143440,144879,understanding that this is going to
D45kcWgVJ7s,144879,146319,happen and what of course it means for
D45kcWgVJ7s,146319,148239,those two countries is that if they are
D45kcWgVJ7s,148239,149760,if this does happen when this does
