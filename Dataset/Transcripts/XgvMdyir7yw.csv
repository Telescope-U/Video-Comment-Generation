XgvMdyir7yw,26584,33090,- [Interviewer] So I'm just gonna ask you  a couple questions about V.  I think we'll talk maybe for five to 10 minutes
XgvMdyir7yw,33090,39330,depending on what we end up comfortable with.  - All right.  - [Interviewer] So I'll start with two easy questions.
XgvMdyir7yw,39330,45300,"The first is, can you start  with saying your name in the camera?  And then can you talk"
XgvMdyir7yw,45300,49939,about how you met Virgil for the first time?  - Okay.
XgvMdyir7yw,67047,75993,"- The first time we really say hi, it was at Ferdi.  And after that, we, we,"
XgvMdyir7yw,77190,83250,meet together the same night  because he wanted to go to a club.  I was driving a sport car that night.
XgvMdyir7yw,83250,89910,"So I had a car with one seat  and and V was like, so what are we doing?  And I was like, I don't wanna split you guys,"
XgvMdyir7yw,89910,97590,but the only place that you can listen nice hip-hop tonight  it's actually in my car.  And V jump in my car and we'd ride around Paris.
XgvMdyir7yw,97590,102990,"We listened to hip-hop, but when he sat in my car  directly knew this guys is my,"
XgvMdyir7yw,102990,109530,"is my, is my best.  'Cause he was sitting the same way, listening the same way,"
XgvMdyir7yw,109530,115170,acting a very nice way.  He wanted just to enjoy the music  and the time with me.
XgvMdyir7yw,115170,120300,"So that time we did that, that night, that from there  we did that every time he was in Paris"
XgvMdyir7yw,120300,127500,"We were just jumping my car, go to dinner, and drive around.  - I was lucky enough that I got to see him"
XgvMdyir7yw,127500,133799,"almost every month.  And if not that, then, you know,  every Fashion Week and any time in between."
XgvMdyir7yw,133800,140220,"And if I would be in Paris, he'd be working at LV  and we would just like, get a coffee from his studio"
XgvMdyir7yw,140220,145470,and go walk like two blocks down.  And there was this little bench we used to sit on
XgvMdyir7yw,145470,152130,"and just like, talk.  And I think that, like all of us the same,"
XgvMdyir7yw,152130,158280,"we always kept in contact over text messaging.  I never was a WhatsApp person,"
XgvMdyir7yw,158280,162333,he always thought that was so funny of me  because I was in Europe so much.
XgvMdyir7yw,164280,169280,"But yeah, no, we were big with invisible ink text messages."
XgvMdyir7yw,169350,176180,"So he really found that very funny.  And yeah, obviously, as we all know, big emoji guy."
XgvMdyir7yw,177570,185519,"- Virgil and I always connected  on our roots, on growing up in the Midwest.  And that was always this kind of like, unspoken,"
XgvMdyir7yw,185520,191099,"just like deep-rooted like understanding of one another.  It was like, I see you."
XgvMdyir7yw,191100,197880,"Like, you made it out from the Midwest.  We're out here in Paris  living these amazing, crazy glamorous lives."
XgvMdyir7yw,197880,202630,But like I see you.  And it was always this special connection
XgvMdyir7yw,203670,209459,"that I felt I had with him.  And, you know, what's amazing  is that so many people had that special connection."
XgvMdyir7yw,209460,217590,And one person's connection  didn't take away from somebody else's.  And he and I got to share so many experiences
XgvMdyir7yw,217590,222840,"over the past,  I don't know, decade plus that I've known him."
XgvMdyir7yw,222840,228510,"And we would find ourselves in these like,  unprecedented situations."
XgvMdyir7yw,228510,233790,"We would be at the Apple Developers Conference  in San Francisco meeting, like, Tim Cook."
XgvMdyir7yw,233790,239430,"And he and I would be just giddy kids  being like, not bad for two kids from the Midwest."
XgvMdyir7yw,239430,244023,"Like, look at us, you know,  this is an crazy, surreal experience."
XgvMdyir7yw,245433,248183,[fans clamoring]
XgvMdyir7yw,260700,267210,"- One time in Paris, we were like,  let's just get coffee.  And right away,  like, I just knew that he,"
XgvMdyir7yw,267210,271729,"I called these people, like my star cluster,  like, someone that's like your soul-friend."
XgvMdyir7yw,274200,282930,"And I just felt that so fast for him.  And yeah, I think right away, we were able to talk"
XgvMdyir7yw,282930,288210,"about so many random things  that I couldn't talk to anyone else about,  like miniature pottery,"
XgvMdyir7yw,288210,293210,"and like, weird felt artists and stuff"
XgvMdyir7yw,293340,300780,"where all my friends wouldn't be interested.  Like, I could send it to V  and he would find inspiration in it as well."
XgvMdyir7yw,300780,306450,He could totally talk to anyone  and find something that was interesting about them to him
XgvMdyir7yw,306450,313620,and that he found inspiring.  And I think he made a lot of people  feel good about themselves and seen and heard.
XgvMdyir7yw,313620,316953,"- I would describe V as like, he was,"
XgvMdyir7yw,318660,324480,"he was living his childhood dream,  but also making other people's dreams come true."
XgvMdyir7yw,324480,333093,"And in the process, he was a big brother to me, a mentor.  He definitely guided me in the right, the right path."
XgvMdyir7yw,334050,339270,I think I was going down the wrong path  and he seen that.  And he knew that  there was something greater that I could do.
XgvMdyir7yw,339270,345300,"And he definitely opened that door and kept it open  when other people were trying to close it on me.  For whatever reason have you,"
XgvMdyir7yw,345300,350910,he definitely opened the door and kept it open  and allowed me to bring in whoever I wanted to.
XgvMdyir7yw,350910,358830,"- So people will see Virgil and me around,  driving, walking, having fun, but we'll do naturally."
XgvMdyir7yw,358830,365430,"So all the kids like us,  because Virgil will never put himself  in a higher statute than anybody else,"
XgvMdyir7yw,365430,370890,"everybody will come talk to Virgil,  he will talk to them.  He will, when he get fame, everybody will ask a picture,"
XgvMdyir7yw,370890,376590,"he will always say yes.  Everybody ask, sign me the shoes,  he will sign the shoes.  He will never make any difference."
XgvMdyir7yw,376590,384420,"So I think all, all these things  seeing from your eyes from my outside,  you would be like, they're doing it, I can do it too."
XgvMdyir7yw,384420,392820,"- He always knew how to incorporate different industries.  When it came to music and fashion, to art and fashion."
XgvMdyir7yw,392820,399180,"When even you see his shows  you see a rapper walking the show,  which, you're like, would a rapper?"
XgvMdyir7yw,399180,404880,But it just made sense because it's part of his life.  He's representing what he lives.
XgvMdyir7yw,404880,409889,"You know, he would DJ, we would go to parties  and he's just there doing his thing,"
XgvMdyir7yw,409890,416250,and just living his best life.  - He's the type of person that makes you feel so special
XgvMdyir7yw,416250,421979,"all the time.  Sorry, I'm already about to cry.  The most joy that it can give me is like,"
XgvMdyir7yw,421980,426303,"or the most like, fulfilling feeling that I could have  from that is like,"
XgvMdyir7yw,427500,433710,"how happy I know that made him.  Like, I know how excited he was.  And that makes me just really happy that like,"
XgvMdyir7yw,433710,439949,"we were able to give that to him.  And we were able to do that together.  And like, it is interesting.  You talk about like, working with friends"
XgvMdyir7yw,439950,446370,"and like, it was literally that,  like, the most comfortable I've ever been  in any work setting is always when he was around."
XgvMdyir7yw,446370,452460,"And like, when we were working together  it was literally like, perfect.  I was like working with friends and family,"
XgvMdyir7yw,452460,460500,"like, it's the best thing ever.  - He was a designer.  Like, there are so few people"
XgvMdyir7yw,460500,469910,who recognize that being a designer  is so vast in what it means.  It's like he was an interpreter of visual language.
XgvMdyir7yw,470280,475890,He was an architect of visual language.  He was like a mass disseminator of information
XgvMdyir7yw,475890,484143,"and of beauty.  He was a champion of diversity.  He was, like, an engineer of,"
XgvMdyir7yw,485400,491035,of a fashion space that didn't exist before him.  Like he was an innovator.  [somber jazz piano music]

XgvMdyir7yw,585240,590435,"you know, having diversity on his group  and making sure that people of color"
XgvMdyir7yw,590435,596280,"are in the C-suite, so to say,  are making part of the biggest decisions."
XgvMdyir7yw,596280,602875,"And, you know, that's something  that I've been thinking a lot about.  It's so important to have that."
XgvMdyir7yw,602875,608010,"And it's almost,  responsibility is a hard word,"
XgvMdyir7yw,608010,613710,but I would say it's a responsibility  because there's so many different ways
XgvMdyir7yw,613710,620870,"that you can pioneer things.  And, and when you have an opportunity to open the door"

XgvMdyir7yw,632250,638880,"you know, being Black Hispanic,  and just a minority in general,"
XgvMdyir7yw,638880,645570,"a lot of the times we get overshadowed  and we are the driving force of an industry,"
XgvMdyir7yw,645570,651540,"when it comes to music,  when it comes to theater, when it comes to fashion.  They take us as inspiration,"
XgvMdyir7yw,651540,656940,"but then sometimes hold us back on,  on showcasing us to the world."
XgvMdyir7yw,656940,664710,"And when Virgil came around,  this kind of like put everything at the forefront,  whereas like, no, we've been about this life"
XgvMdyir7yw,664710,669840,and now you're gonna see us and we're here to stay.  So it's very interesting.
XgvMdyir7yw,669840,676350,"- Wow, this is very far away  from like the first time that I was incredibly moved"
XgvMdyir7yw,676350,682863,"and inspired by Virgil's work.  But actually it's a super poignant example,  which is this exact T-shirt."
XgvMdyir7yw,684480,689670,"And I remember receiving it and it was really recently,  I think maybe like a year ago."
XgvMdyir7yw,689670,697560,"And it was so revolutionary to me,  as a black woman in the fashion space,  to feel specifically recognized"
XgvMdyir7yw,697560,706280,"and, you know, addressed in terms of the fact  that in a misogynistic and patriarchal and racist world,"
XgvMdyir7yw,709830,714870,"black women are often, you know,  at the shortest end of the stick.  And to be so powerful"
XgvMdyir7yw,714870,721350,"and so brilliant and creative  and use, you know a medium that he's so familiar with,"
XgvMdyir7yw,721350,726350,"a T-shirt, to communicate this real understanding"
XgvMdyir7yw,726450,733473,"and empathy of the space  that needs to be provided for black women,  and in my case specifically in fashion was like,"
XgvMdyir7yw,734910,742503,"I mean, it was everything.  And I often said, you know,  that there was just so much safety in Virgil."
XgvMdyir7yw,765210,771817,"- I knew how much time Virgil spended to get there,  to get to the LVC, to get to the,"
XgvMdyir7yw,772820,778503,"to him be able to show with this beautiful brand,  what he's capable to do."
XgvMdyir7yw,779490,784490,"So after the show, we were in a room in the back,"
XgvMdyir7yw,784950,792060,"him and I, and I don't cry too much.  I only cry if something really affect me"
XgvMdyir7yw,792060,799140,"somehow in a good or bad way.  He saw his parents, his parents were crying."
XgvMdyir7yw,799140,805700,"He saw me and we didn't talk,  we look at each other and we said, voila, it's done."
XgvMdyir7yw,806040,811560,"Because we knew,  we didn't cry because the show was beautiful.  We didn't cry because of his parents."
XgvMdyir7yw,811560,818340,We cried because we knew he did that.  He opened the new door for all these people
XgvMdyir7yw,818340,824130,who suffered like him to get to somewhere.  We cried for all these young people  who were at the show
XgvMdyir7yw,824130,830643,and were watching him doing this thing.  It was a lot of feelings at once.
XgvMdyir7yw,833820,840930,"- Also remember that day, right after the show was done,  everyone's here at Hotel Costes and he walks up"
XgvMdyir7yw,840930,847230,"and the entire restaurant just like gets up  and starts applauding him, like, from the waiting staff"
XgvMdyir7yw,847230,854400,"to like, people that just had no idea, you know,  what it was, everyone just got up.  And it was just like this beautiful moment of like,"
XgvMdyir7yw,854400,860970,"you know, it just felt like he just landed in the moon  and came back to earth and won the World Cup,"
XgvMdyir7yw,860970,867933,"was like the most monumental moment  anyone could have ever imagined.  And it was just so, so beautiful, thinking back on it."
XgvMdyir7yw,869160,875527,"- But yeah, he said, come to come to Soho House Miami  as soon as you can.  And I came and I sat down, first thing he said was,"
XgvMdyir7yw,875527,881940,"""I got the job.""  And I didn't even have to ask what it was,  because in truth, we hadn't spoken that much"
XgvMdyir7yw,881940,887610,"about going for the job  or what that process was like.  He just said, ""I got the job,"""
XgvMdyir7yw,887610,894748,"and I straight away knew what he was talking about.  And he said, ""I got the job,""  so obviously we were like cheering."
XgvMdyir7yw,894749,899367,"And he said, ""And you are my first hire.  And I want you to be music director."""
XgvMdyir7yw,900480,908040,"And yeah, in that half an hour, we worked out  the manifesto of what we wanted to do for the whole thing."
XgvMdyir7yw,908040,913040,We wanted to sort of switch up what a fashion show was like.
XgvMdyir7yw,913320,918570,"And we wanted to incorporate live music  for every single one.  And then we decided, okay, BadBadNotGood should be"
XgvMdyir7yw,918570,924015,"the in-house band for the first one.  And all of that was decided in that first half an hour chat.  And then we went off and DJed together, so."

XgvMdyir7yw,1152000,1158120,"I still kind of regret not doing what he,  what Virgil told me to do.  So he wanted me to wear like,"

XgvMdyir7yw,1163817,1171260,"and then just walk out on the court.  And I'm thinking Virgil,  I love fashion and I love pushing the envelope,"

XgvMdyir7yw,1200150,1206540,"it was so cool.  What was inside it  was these words that were written in French, I believe,"
XgvMdyir7yw,1206540,1213740,"like ""mother"" and ""champion""  and things that had helped me stay inspired  throughout the match.  And there were all these really cool pieces."
XgvMdyir7yw,1213740,1222890,"It was like this crazy skirt and top,  not to mention like this little cape jacket  and the long cape and then this long skirt,"
XgvMdyir7yw,1222890,1229279,"which was really cool.  - He made this sick under dress, right, under here,"
XgvMdyir7yw,1229280,1233843,"but not so anybody could see it.  And that's the thing about V is that he was always so,"
XgvMdyir7yw,1234890,1242720,"you know, he always knew exactly what he was doing.  He wasn't gonna make like just a, you know,  a botched little weird shirt to put under this skirt."

XgvMdyir7yw,1249260,1255500,"He was so detail oriented that he wouldn't let anything,  you know, he wouldn't put anything on a girl"
XgvMdyir7yw,1255500,1260899,"unless he knew that every part of it was perfect.  And that was V, you know?  And not because he was a perfectionist"
XgvMdyir7yw,1260900,1267200,"but just 'cause he cared.  And everybody on his team and his atelier and everything,"
XgvMdyir7yw,1267200,1273040,"they're all the same.  They're just, they love when things are perfectly done"
XgvMdyir7yw,1273620,1275243,in the most imperfect way.
XgvMdyir7yw,1296710,1301853,"- The beautiful part of this,  it's when V and I we will drive around before,"
XgvMdyir7yw,1304850,1313039,"we will just do this for love of our life  and what we wanna listen.  Like now, we love to listen to Drake."
XgvMdyir7yw,1313040,1318800,"We will love to go to the stores,  buy something that we always wanted to have."
XgvMdyir7yw,1318800,1323327,We will love to go to Colette.  We will love to go to a simple food place
XgvMdyir7yw,1326420,1332393,that means something to us.  But we never think that we gonna turn Paris to this.
XgvMdyir7yw,1333410,1343060,"And I don't like to say that we turn it to Paris to this,  which we not, but we help it somehow naturally."
XgvMdyir7yw,1343280,1348740,"Because you will see Virgil  and Arthur walking in the street or driving or whatever,"
XgvMdyir7yw,1348740,1354830,"being themself.  He will make the kids who see us  wanna be themself too, you know?"
XgvMdyir7yw,1354830,1359167,"'Cause one beautiful thing about Virgil,  no matter what this level of who he was,"
XgvMdyir7yw,1360170,1365040,"he never put himself higher than somebody else.  That's the chef of Takara, that's my guy."
XgvMdyir7yw,1366470,1370343,"Go, go, go, no, go.  He's so shy, go."
XgvMdyir7yw,1373130,1379583,"No, he wanted to go now look, now he is going back.  I know you gotta go work. [laughing]"
XgvMdyir7yw,1380570,1386970,Au revoir.  - I think something that I've been thinking a lot about
XgvMdyir7yw,1389990,1396559,since he passed what is  to not wish away a moment.
XgvMdyir7yw,1396560,1401929,"I think that V walked into every room,  landed in every town,"
XgvMdyir7yw,1401930,1406930,met every person with such a positivity
XgvMdyir7yw,1407060,1413903,"and a wonder  for where he was that day, that hour, that minute."
XgvMdyir7yw,1414800,1420953,"And that's what I try to carry forward for him.  And that's what I think,"
XgvMdyir7yw,1422420,1429679,"I would hope that all of us as his friends  can come together and do in honor of him,"
XgvMdyir7yw,1429680,1433830,is to keep remembering how
XgvMdyir7yw,1436010,1441590,valuable our time is together.  - I think he also brought his authentic self
XgvMdyir7yw,1441590,1447380,and vision and ideas and perspective  that was from a very different place
XgvMdyir7yw,1447380,1453409,and brought that to the industry  and brought the industry
XgvMdyir7yw,1453410,1458510,"into the 21st century  and into beyond, into the future,"
XgvMdyir7yw,1458510,1463510,into understanding how great ideas can come from anywhere
XgvMdyir7yw,1464660,1471260,"and luxury should be for everyone.  And it's so much more than just, you know,"
XgvMdyir7yw,1471260,1481120,"an incredibly beautiful product,  but it's the idea of, of a community that you're a part of.  It's the idea of an idea that you have access to."
XgvMdyir7yw,1481190,1487820,"- You know, something I lamented to talk to him about a lot  was the hero's journey,  which is, you know,"
XgvMdyir7yw,1487820,1493550,I guess you could say created by Joseph Campbell  or pontificated about by Joseph Campbell.
XgvMdyir7yw,1493550,1500030,"And about you get this call from wherever you are  to the outer realm, to this adventure."
XgvMdyir7yw,1500030,1508490,"But the whole point is to go gain knowledge  and bring it back.  And I, in his hero journey, every human has a hero journey"
XgvMdyir7yw,1508490,1514730,"whether they answer the call or not, it is proposed to you.  I don't care what you do."
XgvMdyir7yw,1514730,1519730,"And he, he finished it in a very short lifetime, 41 years."
XgvMdyir7yw,1520280,1525560,"He brought, he brought like,  you know, Prometheus, I believe, brought the fire back."
XgvMdyir7yw,1525560,1531409,"You know, the knowledge,  the fire of knowledge back to his people,"
XgvMdyir7yw,1531410,1534833,"all people too, 'cause everyone can learn from that."
XgvMdyir7yw,1538940,1546173,"- Magic relies on the belief  that you must adhere to believing in the untrue,"
XgvMdyir7yw,1547040,1555799,"in the illusion, in the trickery.  But your victory was that your magic was true and tangible,"
XgvMdyir7yw,1555800,1562857,"actual and factual,  here before our very own eyes with no lies"
XgvMdyir7yw,1564170,1569960,"We're all one lines.  You pulled black stories out of top hats,"
XgvMdyir7yw,1569960,1575150,showed us what can be done  with no hands behind your back.
XgvMdyir7yw,1575150,1581543,"But instead both outstretched,  beckoning us back into ourselves."
XgvMdyir7yw,1582500,1588260,"When magic is people and not potions  I forget about a shelf,"
XgvMdyir7yw,1588260,1594410,but I do wish I could dig back into mine  and find you one for good health.
XgvMdyir7yw,1594410,1600500,And maybe then I'd believe in a different kind of magic.  And though it is tragic
XgvMdyir7yw,1600500,1606930,how a star shines brightest when it's dying  we know it takes a lifetime to leave
XgvMdyir7yw,1607940,1615500,"and flying is the closest thing to freedom, I believe.  I give thanks to my belief in you"
XgvMdyir7yw,1615500,1622460,and for yours of us.  You found rubies  where I was told there was nothing but rust.
XgvMdyir7yw,1622460,1627460,"And as the dust settles, the magic never fades"
XgvMdyir7yw,1627830,1633320,because I think that true magic is anyone who misbehaves  and nobody can't say
XgvMdyir7yw,1633320,1638990,"you didn't take the planes from the sky  and sew them onto suits,  gathered our roots,"
XgvMdyir7yw,1638990,1643733,"and made fabric feel and look  like books we never got stories in,"
XgvMdyir7yw,1644690,1652520,"took footprints from the moon  and printed them on the bottom of boots,  filled rooms with sounds of time and time travel"
XgvMdyir7yw,1652520,1662110,"and temperatures that could melt the mundane  into the magical.  When you call, the wind blows, the sun glows,"
XgvMdyir7yw,1662450,1668840,"the birds throw themself into the sea and become fish,  whatever your wish,"
XgvMdyir7yw,1668840,1675140,just a whisper of the impossible.  And nobody can tell me you weren't a magician
XgvMdyir7yw,1675140,1681530,"'cause some things just ain't logical.  And if they do, well I won't believe them"
XgvMdyir7yw,1681530,1687350,because we believe in you.  And how can you not believe in magic in Miami?
XgvMdyir7yw,1687350,1693650,"And though tragedy angers me,  I look up and a man is hovering above the sea."
XgvMdyir7yw,1693650,1700039,I look down  and a feather falls from nowhere and sticks to me.  We look into the sky
XgvMdyir7yw,1700040,1706673,and red teardrops read that you were here.  And suddenly all our fear in this world disappears.
XgvMdyir7yw,1708500,1717230,Can you see the galaxy grown  under your perfectly painted nails?  The idea that you weren't magic is just a fallacy.
XgvMdyir7yw,1717230,1723940,"We believe in magic because of you.  You, you, our magical V."
