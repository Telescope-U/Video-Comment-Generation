wBEAjjioZFI,0,3840,today we end the horror today we solve
wBEAjjioZFI,3840,5920,fnaf wait didn't we say this exact same
wBEAjjioZFI,5920,9560,thing seven years ago
wBEAjjioZFI,12530,18199,[Music]
wBEAjjioZFI,23210,24040,[Applause]
wBEAjjioZFI,24040,27039,[Music]
wBEAjjioZFI,27039,30160,hello internet welcome to game theory
wBEAjjioZFI,30160,31439,the show that reminds me that if you
wBEAjjioZFI,31439,33120,click the like button hard enough it'll
wBEAjjioZFI,33120,35520,summon dj music man to your neighborhood
wBEAjjioZFI,35520,37680,for a block party go ahead try it hit
wBEAjjioZFI,37680,39360,that like button didn't work have you
wBEAjjioZFI,39360,40879,have you tried clicking subscribe i hear
wBEAjjioZFI,40879,42559,that sometimes works too i guess you
wBEAjjioZFI,42559,44000,must not be clicking hard enough i don't
wBEAjjioZFI,44000,45280,know what to tell you speaking of not
wBEAjjioZFI,45280,47039,working hard enough aren't you tired of
wBEAjjioZFI,47039,49039,just plain boring merch the kind that
wBEAjjioZFI,49039,51120,you buy and sure it looks cool but it
wBEAjjioZFI,51120,53039,just sits there on your body not doing
wBEAjjioZFI,53039,54960,anything interesting well what if your
wBEAjjioZFI,54960,58320,merch was actually a puzzle introducing
wBEAjjioZFI,58320,60879,the world's first quest jacket i know
wBEAjjioZFI,60879,62399,what you're thinking a denim jacket
wBEAjjioZFI,62399,64400,isn't anything revolutionary and you'd
wBEAjjioZFI,64400,66080,largely be right except you'd also be
wBEAjjioZFI,66080,67840,missing one of the most crucial details
wBEAjjioZFI,67840,69920,those patches they're not just any old
wBEAjjioZFI,69920,72000,dnd style patches they're clues to help
wBEAjjioZFI,72000,74080,you solve a much bigger puzzle that
wBEAjjioZFI,74080,76479,exists inside of this thing it's not
wBEAjjioZFI,76479,79840,just a jacket it's the world's first arg
wBEAjjioZFI,79840,81840,jacket you heard that right a world
wBEAjjioZFI,81840,83600,first it's not every day that you create
wBEAjjioZFI,83600,85439,like the first of something but to all
wBEAjjioZFI,85439,87119,my research i don't think a product like
wBEAjjioZFI,87119,88560,this has ever existed we've actually
wBEAjjioZFI,88560,89840,been working for the past two years to
wBEAjjioZFI,89840,91360,make something like this happen working
wBEAjjioZFI,91360,92799,with garment manufacturers to sew
wBEAjjioZFI,92799,94400,secrets into places that they've never
wBEAjjioZFI,94400,96479,even thought about before obviously i
wBEAjjioZFI,96479,97680,don't want to give too much away because
wBEAjjioZFI,97680,99040,part of the fun is letting you guys
wBEAjjioZFI,99040,100640,solve this for yourself but we pulled
wBEAjjioZFI,100640,102320,out all the stops to give you a piece of
wBEAjjioZFI,102320,103840,clothing that you can actually
wBEAjjioZFI,103840,106399,experience this thing is premium to the
wBEAjjioZFI,106399,108000,max and if you manage to solve it you
wBEAjjioZFI,108000,109759,get a special final patch to show that
wBEAjjioZFI,109759,112079,you are truly the puzzle master so go
wBEAjjioZFI,112079,113600,ahead head on down to the description
wBEAjjioZFI,113600,115600,and be a part of history grab yourself
wBEAjjioZFI,115600,118159,the first ever piece of airg clothing
wBEAjjioZFI,118159,120560,and what will be the first in our series
wBEAjjioZFI,120560,122960,of quest jackets roll an investigation
wBEAjjioZFI,122960,124960,check to see if you've got what it takes
wBEAjjioZFI,124960,127040,today we finish milking
wBEAjjioZFI,127040,129440,i mean covering the major mysteries of
wBEAjjioZFI,129440,130959,security breach and you know what i
wBEAjjioZFI,130959,132640,think i solved it or at least i think
wBEAjjioZFI,132640,134720,i've solved most of it seven years ago i
wBEAjjioZFI,134720,136640,made this video the clue that solves
wBEAjjioZFI,136640,138080,five nights at freddy's where we put
wBEAjjioZFI,138080,140319,together all the pieces to support dream
wBEAjjioZFI,140319,142080,theory the concept that the first four
wBEAjjioZFI,142080,143360,games of the series were all a
wBEAjjioZFI,143360,144800,collection of nightmares happening
wBEAjjioZFI,144800,146400,inside the mind of a child in that
wBEAjjioZFI,146400,148000,episode there were lots of points of
wBEAjjioZFI,148000,149840,evidence but ultimately the conclusion
wBEAjjioZFI,149840,152319,hinged on one key design detail the
wBEAjjioZFI,152319,154800,alarm that brought each night to a close
wBEAjjioZFI,154800,157360,at six o'clock am a grandfather clock
wBEAjjioZFI,157360,159760,for three games and a digital clock for
wBEAjjioZFI,159760,162080,number four three games in the crying
wBEAjjioZFI,162080,163920,child's house where we see a grandfather
wBEAjjioZFI,163920,166480,clock the fourth in a hospital right
wBEAjjioZFI,166480,168879,before he dies which ironically enough
wBEAjjioZFI,168879,170400,is the one whose gameplay is happening
wBEAjjioZFI,170400,172480,in a recreation of the house oh there's
wBEAjjioZFI,172480,174239,a reason this series is so difficult to
wBEAjjioZFI,174239,176000,talk about anyway the reason i bring
wBEAjjioZFI,176000,177760,that video up is because today's theory
wBEAjjioZFI,177760,179599,works largely in the same way over the
wBEAjjioZFI,179599,181200,past few half episodes i've been trying
wBEAjjioZFI,181200,182879,to make heads or tales of security
wBEAjjioZFI,182879,184800,breach pulling at what to me felt like
wBEAjjioZFI,184800,186879,the strongest thread gregory as the
wBEAjjioZFI,186879,190159,crying child reborn in a robot body him
wBEAjjioZFI,190159,191680,reuniting with his brother michael in
wBEAjjioZFI,191680,193200,the form of glam rock freddy and his
wBEAjjioZFI,193200,195280,sister elizabeth in the form of vanessa
wBEAjjioZFI,195280,196640,and we've covered a lot of evidence
wBEAjjioZFI,196640,198000,trying to support that claim the
wBEAjjioZFI,198000,200480,character's design colors the ice cream
wBEAjjioZFI,200480,202480,the voice lines robotic eyes the
wBEAjjioZFI,202480,203680,satisfying narrative arc that it
wBEAjjioZFI,203680,205280,provides the game's three-star ending i
wBEAjjioZFI,205280,207440,mean it's a lot there are two episodes
wBEAjjioZFI,207440,209280,that are jam-packed full of discussion
wBEAjjioZFI,209280,212159,around exactly this but today i finally
wBEAjjioZFI,212159,214480,have my smoking gun the clue that takes
wBEAjjioZFI,214480,216720,it from just a controversial theory to
wBEAjjioZFI,216720,219680,at least in my mind largely proven fact
wBEAjjioZFI,219680,221360,just like with the clocks and the dream
wBEAjjioZFI,221360,223280,theory it's the one clue that is so
wBEAjjioZFI,223280,226159,specific so intentional that it confirms
wBEAjjioZFI,226159,227519,that this was the main intent of the
wBEAjjioZFI,227519,229040,game until of course they decided to
wBEAjjioZFI,229040,230480,retcon it all due to bad audience
wBEAjjioZFI,230480,231920,feedback to keep the franchise going for
wBEAjjioZFI,231920,234239,another seven years sorry guys i hate to
wBEAjjioZFI,234239,236400,say it but i think i'm unfortunately
wBEAjjioZFI,236400,239360,right this time gregory is a robot and
wBEAjjioZFI,239360,241680,he's the crying child reborn and by the
wBEAjjioZFI,241680,243599,end of today i think you're gonna be
wBEAjjioZFI,243599,244959,convinced and then from there we're
wBEAjjioZFI,244959,246879,gonna talk about how all of that factors
wBEAjjioZFI,246879,248799,into the game's narrative and its final
wBEAjjioZFI,248799,252319,mystery patient 46. it all begins here
wBEAjjioZFI,252319,255040,the post-it room
wBEAjjioZFI,255040,256720,this is unexpected after exploring the
wBEAjjioZFI,256720,258479,sewers to decommission chica gregory
wBEAjjioZFI,258479,260639,winds up here a room full of glowing
wBEAjjioZFI,260639,262560,staff bot heads and lots of post-it
wBEAjjioZFI,262560,264720,reminders on literally every surface i
wBEAjjioZFI,264720,267199,mean this thing is a flashing neon sign
wBEAjjioZFI,267199,270000,that says important lore here and yet in
wBEAjjioZFI,270000,271759,online discussions it's been largely
wBEAjjioZFI,271759,273120,overlooked because it's kind of
wBEAjjioZFI,273120,274560,sandwiched in the middle of the game
wBEAjjioZFI,274560,276080,overshadowed by the animatronic
wBEAjjioZFI,276080,277840,spaghetti monster ending and even though
wBEAjjioZFI,277840,279280,i knew that something had to be hidden
wBEAjjioZFI,279280,280880,in here trying to figure it out was like
wBEAjjioZFI,280880,282800,finding a needle in a haystack so what
wBEAjjioZFI,282800,285040,is this what are we looking at here i
wBEAjjioZFI,285040,287040,think it's pretty obvious yeah is it
wBEAjjioZFI,287040,288720,obvious matt what what is it you get to
wBEAjjioZFI,288720,290800,a certain age uh-huh
wBEAjjioZFI,290800,292560,and you just you got to start taking
wBEAjjioZFI,292560,294560,notes post-it notes yeah you just leave
wBEAjjioZFI,294560,297120,them around okay but also there's um
wBEAjjioZFI,297120,298880,robot heads so with that incredible
wBEAjjioZFI,298880,301120,insight i spent literal hours off camera
wBEAjjioZFI,301120,302720,trying to look at every single post-it
wBEAjjioZFI,302720,304000,note to make sure that i had the full
wBEAjjioZFI,304000,306720,picture and the answer i got was don't
wBEAjjioZFI,306720,309199,do not do that learn from my mistakes it
wBEAjjioZFI,309199,312160,took me so long so long only to discover
wBEAjjioZFI,312160,313840,that the game files had been dug up and
wBEAjjioZFI,313840,315840,the post-it textures were just there in
wBEAjjioZFI,315840,318560,three simple images thanks to just x
wBEAjjioZFI,318560,320160,fought for uploading these to github
wBEAjjioZFI,320160,321680,flush those hours of my life down the
wBEAjjioZFI,321680,323120,toilet when you study these posted
wBEAjjioZFI,323120,324800,textures you actually realize that there
wBEAjjioZFI,324800,327120,are three phases to the post-it notes
wBEAjjioZFI,327120,329199,one that's barely legible another where
wBEAjjioZFI,329199,330880,the spelling and drawing improve
wBEAjjioZFI,330880,332960,slightly and the final where they become
wBEAjjioZFI,332960,335280,nearly perfect it looks like someone is
wBEAjjioZFI,335280,337120,trying to learn how to write and draw
wBEAjjioZFI,337120,338960,slowly getting better over time and it
wBEAjjioZFI,338960,340960,all begins here with a note written in
wBEAjjioZFI,340960,342720,binary when you first enter the room
wBEAjjioZFI,342720,344160,there's a cardboard box in the middle
wBEAjjioZFI,344160,346240,which if i were to guess is steel wool
wBEAjjioZFI,346240,347759,trying to draw our attention to the most
wBEAjjioZFI,347759,349280,important post-it clues in what
wBEAjjioZFI,349280,351280,otherwise is a very crowded and busy
wBEAjjioZFI,351280,353759,looking room on it we get this binary
wBEAjjioZFI,353759,357039,string which translates to why is i
wBEAjjioZFI,357039,358880,that's it the grammar i think is
wBEAjjioZFI,358880,360560,intentionally bad because this is a
wBEAjjioZFI,360560,362319,computer coming into consciousness
wBEAjjioZFI,362319,365039,asking the question why am i alive and
wBEAjjioZFI,365039,367360,doing it written in binary the language
wBEAjjioZFI,367360,369919,of machines computers robots elsewhere
wBEAjjioZFI,369919,371280,in the room is more binary that
wBEAjjioZFI,371280,373199,translates to hide whatever this thing
wBEAjjioZFI,373199,375600,is it's scared and it's confused it
wBEAjjioZFI,375600,377440,hides until it can better understand
wBEAjjioZFI,377440,380000,what or who it's meant to be the other
wBEAjjioZFI,380000,382080,illegible phase 1 notes here are random
wBEAjjioZFI,382080,385120,flashing thoughts the sky kids love
wBEAjjioZFI,385120,387199,random glimpses of memories coming into
wBEAjjioZFI,387199,389600,focus the phrase i can feel it is this
wBEAjjioZFI,389600,391199,creature coming into consciousness and
wBEAjjioZFI,391199,394319,this right here you are something family
wBEAjjioZFI,394319,396800,which looks like afton family but it's
wBEAjjioZFI,396800,398560,pretty unclear in short it appears to be
wBEAjjioZFI,398560,400000,a machine that started speaking in
wBEAjjioZFI,400000,402160,binary but as more and more memories
wBEAjjioZFI,402160,404160,start to take hold it begins to write in
wBEAjjioZFI,404160,406160,normal alphabetic characters when you
wBEAjjioZFI,406160,408000,dive into the notes from phases 2 and 3
wBEAjjioZFI,408000,409759,though things start to get much clearer
wBEAjjioZFI,409759,411680,it's mainly images and text revolving
wBEAjjioZFI,411680,413599,around birthday parties happy place
wBEAjjioZFI,413599,416240,birthday time family a pile of presents
wBEAjjioZFI,416240,418960,some cake let's get snack fun fun fun
wBEAjjioZFI,418960,420960,friends forever pizza time nothing
wBEAjjioZFI,420960,422720,particularly earth shattering for a
wBEAjjioZFI,422720,424479,series about pizza restaurants but then
wBEAjjioZFI,424479,426400,there's one posted in the phase three
wBEAjjioZFI,426400,428800,notes that really stands out the one
wBEAjjioZFI,428800,431199,clue that truly brings together the last
wBEAjjioZFI,431199,433520,two months of research this thing is the
wBEAjjioZFI,433520,436080,linchpin it's our smoking gun my friends
wBEAjjioZFI,436080,438080,and it all boils down to a present
wBEAjjioZFI,438080,441919,alongside three simple words all for
wBEAjjioZFI,441919,444880,me the party was all for me does that
wBEAjjioZFI,444880,446400,mean anything to you because it
wBEAjjioZFI,446400,448240,certainly does for me you see in the
wBEAjjioZFI,448240,450319,fnaf survival logbook a seemingly
wBEAjjioZFI,450319,451680,innocuous workbook full of
wBEAjjioZFI,451680,453280,pizzeria-themed activities you have
wBEAjjioZFI,453280,455440,three voices speaking through the pages
wBEAjjioZFI,455440,457520,michael afton writing his answers in red
wBEAjjioZFI,457520,459840,pen the vengeful spirit cassidy using
wBEAjjioZFI,459840,462160,lightly faded text and the crying child
wBEAjjioZFI,462160,464080,altering the physical text of the book
wBEAjjioZFI,464080,465919,one conversation that happens between
wBEAjjioZFI,465919,467840,cassidy and the crying child plays out
wBEAjjioZFI,467840,470319,like this cassidy says the party was for
wBEAjjioZFI,470319,473120,you and the crying child responds it was
wBEAjjioZFI,473120,476720,for me all for me suddenly all the party
wBEAjjioZFI,476720,478319,imagery makes sense the balloons the
wBEAjjioZFI,478319,481120,cake the kids this is the bite victim
wBEAjjioZFI,481120,482960,the crying child coming into
wBEAjjioZFI,482960,484560,consciousness and remembering the
wBEAjjioZFI,484560,486720,birthday party that took his life and
wBEAjjioZFI,486720,488960,using this context suddenly everything
wBEAjjioZFI,488960,490479,in these notes takes on a whole new
wBEAjjioZFI,490479,492080,meaning in the first phase of notes we
wBEAjjioZFI,492080,494000,see a crudely drawn house with a set of
wBEAjjioZFI,494000,495840,arrows pointing towards what looks to be
wBEAjjioZFI,495840,498160,a strange set of doors maybe another
wBEAjjioZFI,498160,500000,building which admittedly doesn't make
wBEAjjioZFI,500000,502000,much sense unless this is the crying
wBEAjjioZFI,502000,504960,child who in fnf4 would walk down and to
wBEAjjioZFI,504960,506639,the right and then back up to go to
wBEAjjioZFI,506639,508960,freddy's with his brother every single
wBEAjjioZFI,508960,510960,day in the phase three notes we see this
wBEAjjioZFI,510960,512479,close-up of a bear which would have been
wBEAjjioZFI,512479,514240,the last thing that the crying child saw
wBEAjjioZFI,514240,516800,before his head got chomped blue yellow
wBEAjjioZFI,516800,518959,green and red those are the flashing
wBEAjjioZFI,518959,521039,lights above the fredbear stage as he
wBEAjjioZFI,521039,522640,gets bit or you know maybe it's the
wBEAjjioZFI,522640,524399,balloons on the nearby table for someone
wBEAjjioZFI,524399,525600,who can't tell the difference between
wBEAjjioZFI,525600,528000,blue and purple even things like hide
wBEAjjioZFI,528000,529920,and know hide relate to the crying
wBEAjjioZFI,529920,531920,child's behavior throughout fnaf 4. he
wBEAjjioZFI,531920,533920,hides under tables and he is constantly
wBEAjjioZFI,533920,535920,made fun of for it throughout the game
wBEAjjioZFI,535920,538160,we also see a lot of dialogue about
wBEAjjioZFI,538160,540320,running away just like on the post-its
wBEAjjioZFI,540320,542160,digging deeper we also start to see
wBEAjjioZFI,542160,544480,other patterns emerging the number 7
wBEAjjioZFI,544480,546399,shows up repeatedly as both a set of
wBEAjjioZFI,546399,548000,tally marks as well as a set of six
wBEAjjioZFI,548000,549760,faces with a smaller seventh one off to
wBEAjjioZFI,549760,551680,the side this ties us directly back to
wBEAjjioZFI,551680,553920,fnaf vr where we had a glitching purple
wBEAjjioZFI,553920,556080,gravestone for afton in the middle of
wBEAjjioZFI,556080,558640,seven normal gravestones five missing
wBEAjjioZFI,558640,560399,children charlie the puppet and the
wBEAjjioZFI,560399,562720,smaller face watching on the crying
wBEAjjioZFI,562720,564640,child as he says in other notes all my
wBEAjjioZFI,564640,566399,friends there's also repeated use of the
wBEAjjioZFI,566399,568880,number three three faces three kids
wBEAjjioZFI,568880,570880,words repeated three times like home
wBEAjjioZFI,570880,573120,home home and fun fun fun three slices
wBEAjjioZFI,573120,575040,of pizza three presents even just
wBEAjjioZFI,575040,576800,counting to the number three so what
wBEAjjioZFI,576800,578080,would that mean well think about it
wBEAjjioZFI,578080,579519,we've seen a lot of references to a
wBEAjjioZFI,579519,581040,house and family throughout these
wBEAjjioZFI,581040,582399,post-its seems to me like it's a
wBEAjjioZFI,582399,584640,reference to the three afton kids
wBEAjjioZFI,584640,586959,michael elizabeth and the crying child
wBEAjjioZFI,586959,588720,himself and the thing that brings all of
wBEAjjioZFI,588720,590399,it together isn't a post-it note but
wBEAjjioZFI,590399,592240,instead the table higher up in the room
wBEAjjioZFI,592240,594000,where we see the staff bots arranged
wBEAjjioZFI,594000,595920,like a family at dinner a mother and a
wBEAjjioZFI,595920,598560,father alongside their three kids one
wBEAjjioZFI,598560,601040,red-headed pigtail girl one boy and a
wBEAjjioZFI,601040,602880,kid with his head bit off and just to
wBEAjjioZFI,602880,604640,hammer it all home in the middle of the
wBEAjjioZFI,604640,606800,table the collectible is a poster for
wBEAjjioZFI,606800,609440,fredbear's family diner the place of the
wBEAjjioZFI,609440,611920,bite the place where all of this began
wBEAjjioZFI,611920,613839,it looks like the robot finally figured
wBEAjjioZFI,613839,615600,out who he was and he started to
wBEAjjioZFI,615600,618000,recreate his family the robot is the
wBEAjjioZFI,618000,620720,crying child which by proxy then has to
wBEAjjioZFI,620720,622640,be gregory and if you need further proof
wBEAjjioZFI,622640,624720,of humanoid robots in the game ili becky
wBEAjjioZFI,624720,626160,and reddit caught this detail from
wBEAjjioZFI,626160,628480,sister location humanoid heads ones that
wBEAjjioZFI,628480,630720,look very similar to gregory's face oh
wBEAjjioZFI,630720,632640,and a last thing much to everyone's
wBEAjjioZFI,632640,634399,excitement there's actually a new book
wBEAjjioZFI,634399,636160,series coming out later this year a new
wBEAjjioZFI,636160,638079,season of fazbear frights called tales
wBEAjjioZFI,638079,640240,from the pizzaplex obviously referencing
wBEAjjioZFI,640240,642079,the location and security breach the
wBEAjjioZFI,642079,643519,cover of the first book in the new
wBEAjjioZFI,643519,646160,series robot kid there it is which leads
wBEAjjioZFI,646160,648079,us then to the last puzzle of security
wBEAjjioZFI,648079,650240,breach the retro cds for those of you
wBEAjjioZFI,650240,652079,don't know there are 16 cds around the
wBEAjjioZFI,652079,653600,map that you can only find once you've
wBEAjjioZFI,653600,655440,upgraded freddie's eyes from there you
wBEAjjioZFI,655440,657120,take the cds to a hidden room designed
wBEAjjioZFI,657120,658880,to look exactly like mike's room from
wBEAjjioZFI,658880,660959,sister location these cds seem to be
wBEAjjioZFI,660959,662640,recordings of the therapy sessions for
wBEAjjioZFI,662640,664959,two patients patient 71 who we mentioned
wBEAjjioZFI,664959,667040,last time is clearly vanessa and patient
wBEAjjioZFI,667040,669839,46 who we never get to hear speak and
wBEAjjioZFI,669839,671360,over the course of the various sessions
wBEAjjioZFI,671360,673680,46 and 71 are set up to be direct
wBEAjjioZFI,673680,675519,opposites of each other vanessa likes
wBEAjjioZFI,675519,678959,flowers patient 46 does not oh you like
wBEAjjioZFI,678959,680800,those the janitor on this floor has a
wBEAjjioZFI,680800,682640,garden and has been putting bouquets in
wBEAjjioZFI,682640,685200,the offices here for years what's the
wBEAjjioZFI,685200,687519,problem oh the flowers i'll move them
wBEAjjioZFI,687519,689120,vanessa likes blue skies and doesn't
wBEAjjioZFI,689120,691839,like dark basements 46 prefers it dark i
wBEAjjioZFI,691839,694160,like the blue sky i don't like dark
wBEAjjioZFI,694160,697040,basements oh right too bright when the
wBEAjjioZFI,697040,698800,shades pulled it feels like we're in a
wBEAjjioZFI,698800,700880,cubby hole or a cave yeah vanessa
wBEAjjioZFI,700880,702959,doesn't like candy 46 does would you
wBEAjjioZFI,702959,705600,like a candy no thank you those have 35
wBEAjjioZFI,705600,707120,calories a piece
wBEAjjioZFI,707120,709279,sure you can have a candy clearly we're
wBEAjjioZFI,709279,710560,meant to see these characters as
wBEAjjioZFI,710560,712399,opposites which is why so many people
wBEAjjioZFI,712399,714720,online consider that patient 46 might
wBEAjjioZFI,714720,717360,actually be vani vanessa's alter ego
wBEAjjioZFI,717360,719519,possessed by glitch trap or even more
wBEAjjioZFI,719519,721839,extreme vanessa's evil twin sister
wBEAjjioZFI,721839,723600,considering the fire ending shows us a
wBEAjjioZFI,723600,725680,dead vani on the ground and vanessa
wBEAjjioZFI,725680,727519,looking down from the burning building's
wBEAjjioZFI,727519,729200,roof but let's quickly talk about those
wBEAjjioZFI,729200,731440,two interpretations first of all vanessa
wBEAjjioZFI,731440,733680,and vani are the same person they have
wBEAjjioZFI,733680,735120,to be all the evidence leading up to
wBEAjjioZFI,735120,736880,this game in places like fnaf special
wBEAjjioZFI,736880,738800,delivery have pointed to a woman named
wBEAjjioZFI,738800,741200,vanessa a getting mind hacked by afton
wBEAjjioZFI,741200,742959,and reluctantly following his orders and
wBEAjjioZFI,742959,745040,in this game we still have pieces of
wBEAjjioZFI,745040,746720,evidence for instance in the cds we
wBEAjjioZFI,746720,748399,learned that vanessa is buying fake fur
wBEAjjioZFI,748399,750160,to make the vanity costume on your
wBEAjjioZFI,750160,752320,brakes it looks like you were shopping
wBEAjjioZFI,752320,754880,for a costume you purchased some fake
wBEAjjioZFI,754880,756399,fur material
wBEAjjioZFI,756399,758480,what are you gonna make if she's not the
wBEAjjioZFI,758480,760880,one wearing it why would she be making
wBEAjjioZFI,760880,762639,it to me the fire ending here is meant
wBEAjjioZFI,762639,764240,to be symbolic we haven't beaten
wBEAjjioZFI,764240,766240,princess quest yet so vanessa's spirit
wBEAjjioZFI,766240,767920,is still trapped inside that burning
wBEAjjioZFI,767920,770800,building but her body has died she is
wBEAjjioZFI,770800,773519,one person but could the persona of vani
wBEAjjioZFI,773519,775920,actually be patient 46. again the
wBEAjjioZFI,775920,777839,evidence just doesn't seem to add up to
wBEAjjioZFI,777839,779200,that throughout their sessions we get
wBEAjjioZFI,779200,780880,multiple indications that the therapist
wBEAjjioZFI,780880,782639,is speaking to a child the way they
wBEAjjioZFI,782639,784399,speak to patient 46 here you don't want
wBEAjjioZFI,784399,786399,me to get in trouble do you i could be
wBEAjjioZFI,786399,789120,put in the corner for a time out
wBEAjjioZFI,789120,791279,yeah you think that's funny huh and
wBEAjjioZFI,791279,793839,again here tragedy always leads to a
wBEAjjioZFI,793839,795360,feeling of loss
wBEAjjioZFI,795360,797839,it's a hole that feels funny
wBEAjjioZFI,797839,800320,right the way they explain simple words
wBEAjjioZFI,800320,803120,and i'm surprised by your knowledge of
wBEAjjioZFI,803120,806399,computers you're something of a phenom
wBEAjjioZFI,806399,808720,do you know what that word means it
wBEAjjioZFI,808720,812240,means you have unusual skill like haka
wBEAjjioZFI,812240,814320,the way they point out that 46 doesn't
wBEAjjioZFI,814320,816320,fit into the chair that chair doesn't
wBEAjjioZFI,816320,818480,really fit you does it they even mention
wBEAjjioZFI,818480,820079,the fact that they specifically work
wBEAjjioZFI,820079,822160,with children you know i work with
wBEAjjioZFI,822160,824880,people of all ages from little kids to
wBEAjjioZFI,824880,826639,the very elderly i understand that
wBEAjjioZFI,826639,828560,therapists would want to treat alters as
wBEAjjioZFI,828560,830079,they see themselves but this just
wBEAjjioZFI,830079,831760,doesn't seem to fit at no point do we
wBEAjjioZFI,831760,834320,get an indication that vani sees herself
wBEAjjioZFI,834320,836639,as a child but now let's go back to what
wBEAjjioZFI,836639,838639,we assume we know about 46. they're a
wBEAjjioZFI,838639,840959,kid they like the dark they like candy
wBEAjjioZFI,840959,842720,they're really good with computers in
wBEAjjioZFI,842720,844639,fact they're a bit robotic themselves
wBEAjjioZFI,844639,846720,answering questions in cold detached
wBEAjjioZFI,846720,848480,ways when i read your account of what
wBEAjjioZFI,848480,850959,happened it came across as
wBEAjjioZFI,850959,853600,well more of an objective rather than a
wBEAjjioZFI,853600,855440,subjective narrative
wBEAjjioZFI,855440,857120,oh sorry
wBEAjjioZFI,857120,859199,you don't know what that means do you
wBEAjjioZFI,859199,860720,here again we get another example of the
wBEAjjioZFI,860720,862320,therapist having to explain a relatively
wBEAjjioZFI,862320,864800,simple word now look at our post-it room
wBEAjjioZFI,864800,867199,it's a dark cave underground outright
wBEAjjioZFI,867199,869279,labeled as this is my home on the
wBEAjjioZFI,869279,871760,central cardboard box is a drawing of
wBEAjjioZFI,871760,874000,candy and a robot would be emotionally
wBEAjjioZFI,874000,876079,detached and would also be great at
wBEAjjioZFI,876079,877920,hacking heck the therapist does tell
wBEAjjioZFI,877920,880000,patient 46 to write down their feelings
wBEAjjioZFI,880000,882560,i suggested you write down exactly what
wBEAjjioZFI,882560,884880,made you so sad and scared and if this
wBEAjjioZFI,884880,886560,room isn't an example of that i don't
wBEAjjioZFI,886560,888480,know what is taking it one step further
wBEAjjioZFI,888480,890320,if i'm right in saying that gregory is
wBEAjjioZFI,890320,891519,indeed the robot that came into
wBEAjjioZFI,891519,893279,consciousness here that's why he doesn't
wBEAjjioZFI,893279,894959,fit into the chair he's a kid that's
wBEAjjioZFI,894959,896800,also the reason steel wool couldn't let
wBEAjjioZFI,896800,898639,us hear 46's voice throughout these
wBEAjjioZFI,898639,900160,therapists tapes it would give away the
wBEAjjioZFI,900160,901839,game it would immediately take away the
wBEAjjioZFI,901839,903760,mystery of who 46 is since we hear
wBEAjjioZFI,903760,906000,gregory talk so much but why would
wBEAjjioZFI,906000,908079,gregory a robot kid hiding out in the
wBEAjjioZFI,908079,910079,pizzaplex actively be seeking out
wBEAjjioZFI,910079,912240,therapy he's not in a school of any kind
wBEAjjioZFI,912240,914000,and he's not employed so it wouldn't be
wBEAjjioZFI,914000,916639,mandated what is going on here well over
wBEAjjioZFI,916639,918639,the course of the 16 cds we listen as
wBEAjjioZFI,918639,920800,both patient 46 and vanessa visit a
wBEAjjioZFI,920800,923440,total of five therapists all of whom are
wBEAjjioZFI,923440,925360,implied to have been mangled to death by
wBEAjjioZFI,925360,927199,machinery but the deaths here aren't
wBEAjjioZFI,927199,929360,arbitrary if you track the tapes each
wBEAjjioZFI,929360,931040,therapist ends up getting killed off
wBEAjjioZFI,931040,932639,immediately after they start asking
wBEAjjioZFI,932639,934560,vanessa about encrypted messages that
wBEAjjioZFI,934560,936399,she's been receiving from a mysterious
wBEAjjioZFI,936399,939199,figure your performance reviews are good
wBEAjjioZFI,939199,941360,but a routine check of your online
wBEAjjioZFI,941360,943040,history has revealed that you spent
wBEAjjioZFI,943040,944959,quite a bit of time with someone in an
wBEAjjioZFI,944959,947279,encrypted conversation
wBEAjjioZFI,947279,949440,we have transcripts and i've read them
wBEAjjioZFI,949440,951680,dead the next session the messages
wBEAjjioZFI,951680,953120,you're getting seem
wBEAjjioZFI,953120,956160,very manipulative in nature you know who
wBEAjjioZFI,956160,957920,i'm talking about
wBEAjjioZFI,957920,960320,why won't you open up about it these
wBEAjjioZFI,960320,962560,files are full of details about your
wBEAjjioZFI,962560,964720,life again dead the next session when
wBEAjjioZFI,964720,966240,the encrypted messages get brought up to
wBEAjjioZFI,966240,968560,46 same thing when i saw some of your
wBEAjjioZFI,968560,971199,recent encrypted conversation logs at
wBEAjjioZFI,971199,973120,first i thought i was looking at more
wBEAjjioZFI,973120,974720,examples of you just talking with
wBEAjjioZFI,974720,976720,yourself then i realized it was
wBEAjjioZFI,976720,979360,different when i study this
wBEAjjioZFI,979360,981519,it sounds like there is someone else
wBEAjjioZFI,981519,983839,responding to you a third therapist
wBEAjjioZFI,983839,986000,bites the dust the therapists cover all
wBEAjjioZFI,986000,988079,sorts of topics bad childhoods work
wBEAjjioZFI,988079,990000,history one therapist even confronts
wBEAjjioZFI,990000,991920,patient 46 with all the other dead
wBEAjjioZFI,991920,994480,therapists nothing no response it's only
wBEAjjioZFI,994480,996480,once the encrypted messages come up that
wBEAjjioZFI,996480,998720,they're suddenly marked for death we
wBEAjjioZFI,998720,1001199,also know that it's 46 doing the killing
wBEAjjioZFI,1001199,1003040,here the dead therapists are a complete
wBEAjjioZFI,1003040,1006480,surprise to vanessa hi go ahead sit down
wBEAjjioZFI,1006480,1007839,i don't know you
wBEAjjioZFI,1007839,1009199,what happened to
wBEAjjioZFI,1009199,1011360,oh we'll get to know each other in no
wBEAjjioZFI,1011360,1014000,time but to 46 just business as usual
wBEAjjioZFI,1014000,1016240,why did you lie why don't we come back
wBEAjjioZFI,1016240,1017839,to this another day
wBEAjjioZFI,1017839,1019759,you're shaking your head as though
wBEAjjioZFI,1019759,1021600,that's not going to happen he's shaking
wBEAjjioZFI,1021600,1023199,his head because he knows that now she
wBEAjjioZFI,1023199,1025918,is also marked for death to me all of
wBEAjjioZFI,1025918,1028319,this screams of 46 keeping tabs on
wBEAjjioZFI,1028319,1030400,vanessa he's going to therapy not for
wBEAjjioZFI,1030400,1033199,himself but rather to follow her actions
wBEAjjioZFI,1033199,1034640,making sure that she's not saying
wBEAjjioZFI,1034640,1036319,anything that she shouldn't about these
wBEAjjioZFI,1036319,1037918,encrypted messages and when the
wBEAjjioZFI,1037918,1040079,therapists do get too close to the truth
wBEAjjioZFI,1040079,1041760,they're bumped off we learn in one of
wBEAjjioZFI,1041760,1044160,the last cds that patient 46 isn't being
wBEAjjioZFI,1044160,1046480,manipulated but is instead the one doing
wBEAjjioZFI,1046480,1048558,the manipulation i don't think you're
wBEAjjioZFI,1048558,1050960,being manipulated here i think you're
wBEAjjioZFI,1050960,1053200,the one doing the manipulating no
wBEAjjioZFI,1053200,1054320,comment
wBEAjjioZFI,1054320,1056080,huh putting two and two together would
wBEAjjioZFI,1056080,1057919,tell us that patient 46 is the one
wBEAjjioZFI,1057919,1059440,communicating with vanessa he's
wBEAjjioZFI,1059440,1061520,controlling her life for some reason in
wBEAjjioZFI,1061520,1063600,fact 46 appears to be the reason vanessa
wBEAjjioZFI,1063600,1065360,is working at the pizzaplex in the first
wBEAjjioZFI,1065360,1067360,place one odd detail of the in-game
wBEAjjioZFI,1067360,1069120,messages is that vanessa was not
wBEAjjioZFI,1069120,1071039,supposed to get the security job in the
wBEAjjioZFI,1071039,1072720,message marked for deletion we see that
wBEAjjioZFI,1072720,1074559,vanessa's lack of security experience
wBEAjjioZFI,1074559,1076480,gets the interviewer to not recommend
wBEAjjioZFI,1076480,1078400,her for the job and yet she's hired
wBEAjjioZFI,1078400,1080559,anyway despite as it says in another
wBEAjjioZFI,1080559,1083280,message no prior qualifications in both
wBEAjjioZFI,1083280,1084880,messages we're told that it's an
wBEAjjioZFI,1084880,1086880,internal reference coming from the top
wBEAjjioZFI,1086880,1089120,that got her the job someone has brought
wBEAjjioZFI,1089120,1091520,vanessa here for a specific purpose and
wBEAjjioZFI,1091520,1093760,who better than a hacker that's clearly
wBEAjjioZFI,1093760,1095520,established to be in the pizzaplex's
wBEAjjioZFI,1095520,1099120,emails patient 46 gregory in short it
wBEAjjioZFI,1099120,1100720,looks like gregory is manipulating the
wBEAjjioZFI,1100720,1102640,situation determined to get vanessa to
wBEAjjioZFI,1102640,1104559,work at the pizzaplex following her to
wBEAjjioZFI,1104559,1106559,all her mandated therapy sessions and
wBEAjjioZFI,1106559,1108240,ultimately killing off anyone that gets
wBEAjjioZFI,1108240,1110160,too close to the truth i mean after all
wBEAjjioZFI,1110160,1112080,gregory is not opposed to using a bit of
wBEAjjioZFI,1112080,1113919,violence to get what he wants we have to
wBEAjjioZFI,1113919,1115200,get these
wBEAjjioZFI,1115200,1118240,we can upgrade you
wBEAjjioZFI,1119520,1121919,he's also not opposed to lying about it
wBEAjjioZFI,1121919,1123520,this upgrade
wBEAjjioZFI,1123520,1126080,it was chicas
wBEAjjioZFI,1126080,1128480,please be honest
wBEAjjioZFI,1128480,1130799,how did you get it when i was in the
wBEAjjioZFI,1130799,1133280,kitchen earlier she fell into some sort
wBEAjjioZFI,1133280,1136559,of garbage smasher is she okay
wBEAjjioZFI,1136559,1137679,well
wBEAjjioZFI,1137679,1141039,she's still functional but why why is he
wBEAjjioZFI,1141039,1142960,going to all of this effort well combine
wBEAjjioZFI,1142960,1144480,it with what we saw in the post-it room
wBEAjjioZFI,1144480,1146720,there's a family reunion scene multiple
wBEAjjioZFI,1146720,1148799,post-its referring to family the three
wBEAjjioZFI,1148799,1150480,siblings their house remember what i
wBEAjjioZFI,1150480,1152240,said earlier a robot has come into
wBEAjjioZFI,1152240,1154080,consciousness and is trying to reclaim
wBEAjjioZFI,1154080,1156480,what he lost his family he wants the
wBEAjjioZFI,1156480,1158480,family back together and so he's doing
wBEAjjioZFI,1158480,1159919,everything in his power to make that
wBEAjjioZFI,1159919,1161600,happen using his hacking skills he's
wBEAjjioZFI,1161600,1163520,managed to break into staff files so he
wBEAjjioZFI,1163520,1165200,knows that there's something off about
wBEAjjioZFI,1165200,1166799,vanessa maybe he even knows that his
wBEAjjioZFI,1166799,1168480,dad's consciousness is inside of her
wBEAjjioZFI,1168480,1170320,he's also got his brother and freddie
wBEAjjioZFI,1170320,1172480,and his dad in the basement the family
wBEAjjioZFI,1172480,1174320,in this game is truly coming together
wBEAjjioZFI,1174320,1176880,again reclaiming what crying child once
wBEAjjioZFI,1176880,1178240,lost and that's it that's the whole
wBEAjjioZFI,1178240,1179919,theory done there are definitely no
wBEAjjioZFI,1179919,1181600,holes or flaws to anything i just said
wBEAjjioZFI,1181600,1183520,don't look any deeper than everything i
wBEAjjioZFI,1183520,1185760,just told you all right fine there might
wBEAjjioZFI,1185760,1188559,be a few itty-bitty holes to all of this
wBEAjjioZFI,1188559,1190640,explanation namely some of the info that
wBEAjjioZFI,1190640,1192880,we get from the last two cds if patient
wBEAjjioZFI,1192880,1195600,46 is gregory then why is he glitching
wBEAjjioZFI,1195600,1197440,the system to make all the animatronics
wBEAjjioZFI,1197440,1199200,scarier if he lured vanessa to the
wBEAjjioZFI,1199200,1201120,pizzaplex then why would he then be
wBEAjjioZFI,1201120,1202880,avoiding her throughout the game why
wBEAjjioZFI,1202880,1204960,would he be surprised to see afton in
wBEAjjioZFI,1204960,1206240,the basement if he's trying to bring the
wBEAjjioZFI,1206240,1207600,family all together there's also the
wBEAjjioZFI,1207600,1210080,mystery of the whole parent story 46 is
wBEAjjioZFI,1210080,1211840,said to have good parents none of what
wBEAjjioZFI,1211840,1214559,you said in your file about your parents
wBEAjjioZFI,1214559,1216320,was true
wBEAjjioZFI,1216320,1219360,the truth is you had great parents
wBEAjjioZFI,1219360,1221679,a great childhood
wBEAjjioZFI,1221679,1224080,why did you lie but how would records of
wBEAjjioZFI,1224080,1226159,good parenting exist for a robot who
wBEAjjioZFI,1226159,1228240,presumably had no parents or the crying
wBEAjjioZFI,1228240,1230159,child whose records presumably would say
wBEAjjioZFI,1230159,1231840,that he was dead or even if you don't
wBEAjjioZFI,1231840,1234159,believe those theories if 46 is gregory
wBEAjjioZFI,1234159,1236000,and gregory's just a homeless kid that
wBEAjjioZFI,1236000,1237520,doesn't sound like he would have had a
wBEAjjioZFI,1237520,1240080,great childhood or any sort of home life
wBEAjjioZFI,1240080,1241679,but the kicker the one to me that makes
wBEAjjioZFI,1241679,1243600,this really difficult to explain is this
wBEAjjioZFI,1243600,1245360,email that i had long forgotten about
wBEAjjioZFI,1245360,1247600,from fnaf ar strap in for this one
wBEAjjioZFI,1247600,1249600,friends hey ness i hope things are good
wBEAjjioZFI,1249600,1252240,i saw you ordered three lifelike human
wBEAjjioZFI,1252240,1254480,male rubber masks and i was dying to ask
wBEAjjioZFI,1254480,1256240,what they're for sounds to me like a
wBEAjjioZFI,1256240,1258240,robot kid is confirmed but it also
wBEAjjioZFI,1258240,1260320,sounds to me like vanessa built it or
wBEAjjioZFI,1260320,1263200,gave rise to this robot kid if so then i
wBEAjjioZFI,1263200,1265840,ask again why would gregory be avoiding
wBEAjjioZFI,1265840,1267520,her throughout the game i mean the best
wBEAjjioZFI,1267520,1268880,i could come up with is that somehow
wBEAjjioZFI,1268880,1270880,gregory escaped and is now convinced
wBEAjjioZFI,1270880,1273200,that vanessa is trying to shut him down
wBEAjjioZFI,1273200,1275200,because of his rogue programming i mean
wBEAjjioZFI,1275200,1276400,it's not a bad idea but then why would
wBEAjjioZFI,1276400,1277840,he be luring her to the pizza plex it's
wBEAjjioZFI,1277840,1279440,like one half of each explanation works
wBEAjjioZFI,1279440,1280640,but then when you try to connect it back
wBEAjjioZFI,1280640,1282320,with like the other half of the theory
wBEAjjioZFI,1282320,1283760,they end up contradicting each other
wBEAjjioZFI,1283760,1285679,which is really frustrating there are
wBEAjjioZFI,1285679,1287679,two other options first the robot kit
wBEAjjioZFI,1287679,1289200,from the post-it room is entirely brand
wBEAjjioZFI,1289200,1291360,new or the second option is it's someone
wBEAjjioZFI,1291360,1293360,that we never see in the game baby now
wBEAjjioZFI,1293360,1294480,the first option of a brand new
wBEAjjioZFI,1294480,1296720,character yeah it's cool i guess i can't
wBEAjjioZFI,1296720,1298400,really speculate about that it could
wBEAjjioZFI,1298400,1300159,literally go anywhere and solve
wBEAjjioZFI,1300159,1302799,everything as for option two baby just
wBEAjjioZFI,1302799,1304240,like with gregory there are certain
wBEAjjioZFI,1304240,1306000,things that fit and other things that
wBEAjjioZFI,1306000,1308480,just don't baby like gregory could want
wBEAjjioZFI,1308480,1310240,to put the family back together baby has
wBEAjjioZFI,1310240,1312159,always wanted to make daddy proud so
wBEAjjioZFI,1312159,1313600,she'd be quite happy to kill off
wBEAjjioZFI,1313600,1315280,therapists that got too close to the
wBEAjjioZFI,1315280,1317440,truth just like we see with 46 and she
wBEAjjioZFI,1317440,1319520,would willingly spread the afton virus
wBEAjjioZFI,1319520,1321280,to make the animatronics scary in order
wBEAjjioZFI,1321280,1323200,to bring daddy back if she's using
wBEAjjioZFI,1323200,1325120,illusion discs or if she acts like she
wBEAjjioZFI,1325120,1326400,does in the books then it's possible
wBEAjjioZFI,1326400,1328000,that she'd be able to take the form of a
wBEAjjioZFI,1328000,1330320,child and make up a backstory she's also
wBEAjjioZFI,1330320,1331840,a character that canonically loves
wBEAjjioZFI,1331840,1334320,disguises just like patient 46. it
wBEAjjioZFI,1334320,1336799,reminds you of a mask like a disguise
wBEAjjioZFI,1336799,1339280,yeah i can see that you like the idea of
wBEAjjioZFI,1339280,1341520,being disguised disguises let you be
wBEAjjioZFI,1341520,1343280,sort of invisible don't they there's
wBEAjjioZFI,1343280,1344799,also a line about the therapist being
wBEAjjioZFI,1344799,1347039,able to see patient 46's eyes that's
wBEAjjioZFI,1347039,1349200,better on this side of the desk i can
wBEAjjioZFI,1349200,1351039,see your eyes and we know that baby's
wBEAjjioZFI,1351039,1352799,eye color has always been an important
wBEAjjioZFI,1352799,1355200,detail in the past but as with gregory
wBEAjjioZFI,1355200,1357200,there are still a number of holes with
wBEAjjioZFI,1357200,1359120,this line of thinking baby slash
wBEAjjioZFI,1359120,1361520,elizabeth likes flowers patient 46
wBEAjjioZFI,1361520,1363679,doesn't we also know baby hates being in
wBEAjjioZFI,1363679,1365520,the basement of sister location so then
wBEAjjioZFI,1365520,1368320,why as patient 46 would she prefer to
wBEAjjioZFI,1368320,1370799,live in a cave rather than blue sky in
wBEAjjioZFI,1370799,1372720,short as i wrap up my overall coverage
wBEAjjioZFI,1372720,1374159,of security breach i guess i gotta
wBEAjjioZFI,1374159,1375679,summarize it like this this game is
wBEAjjioZFI,1375679,1377440,frustrating from a lore standpoint
wBEAjjioZFI,1377440,1379280,smaller questions like glam rock bonnie
wBEAjjioZFI,1379280,1380880,and golden freddy yeah those are pretty
wBEAjjioZFI,1380880,1382720,easy to answer but when it comes to what
wBEAjjioZFI,1382720,1385200,this game was actually about no one
wBEAjjioZFI,1385200,1387360,theory actually solves it all in a clean
wBEAjjioZFI,1387360,1389840,way there are references to every corner
wBEAjjioZFI,1389840,1391600,of the fnaf universe in here but as a
wBEAjjioZFI,1391600,1394000,result nothing fits cleanly together to
wBEAjjioZFI,1394000,1396240,solve everything there are pieces that
wBEAjjioZFI,1396240,1398240,always dangle or always contradict
wBEAjjioZFI,1398240,1399679,something else do i think the crying
wBEAjjioZFI,1399679,1401520,child is here based on the post-it room
wBEAjjioZFI,1401520,1404880,yes absolutely is he gregory i mean
wBEAjjioZFI,1404880,1406880,right now i think that he's our best
wBEAjjioZFI,1406880,1410559,option is he also patient 46
wBEAjjioZFI,1410559,1413280,seems like he's trying to be but there
wBEAjjioZFI,1413280,1415120,are just a lot of holes there and there
wBEAjjioZFI,1415120,1417039,are holes in the baby theory too and
wBEAjjioZFI,1417039,1418799,that honestly just leaves the option of
wBEAjjioZFI,1418799,1420559,a mysterious third party pulling the
wBEAjjioZFI,1420559,1422400,strings behind the scenes which on one
wBEAjjioZFI,1422400,1424320,hand would be welcome i'd love to see a
wBEAjjioZFI,1424320,1426320,new character inserted into this lore
wBEAjjioZFI,1426320,1427679,but on the other hand it also feels
wBEAjjioZFI,1427679,1429360,unsatisfying because it's like well that
wBEAjjioZFI,1429360,1431440,came out of nowhere this franchise has
wBEAjjioZFI,1431440,1433440,never operated like that so it feels
wBEAjjioZFI,1433440,1435200,weird for it to start acting that way
wBEAjjioZFI,1435200,1437120,now individually small pieces of the
wBEAjjioZFI,1437120,1438799,mystery make sense but when you take a
wBEAjjioZFI,1438799,1440880,step back and look at the wider lore of
wBEAjjioZFI,1440880,1442320,the series how it connects to other
wBEAjjioZFI,1442320,1444080,games how it connects to the wider story
wBEAjjioZFI,1444080,1445679,arc that's been created that's when
wBEAjjioZFI,1445679,1447600,things start to fall apart and i think
wBEAjjioZFI,1447600,1450159,that is what is so frustrating with this
wBEAjjioZFI,1450159,1452480,title so that's what i'm left with let
wBEAjjioZFI,1452480,1454080,me know what your thoughts are are you
wBEAjjioZFI,1454080,1455840,seeing things that i'm not hopefully at
wBEAjjioZFI,1455840,1457360,least sparked some ideas in your head
wBEAjjioZFI,1457360,1458960,and hey if it did you can let me know
wBEAjjioZFI,1458960,1461760,live right now i am officially live with

wBEAjjioZFI,1469360,1470799,we haven't covered yet and of course
wBEAjjioZFI,1470799,1472480,just generally chatting about what we
wBEAjjioZFI,1472480,1473760,thought of the game where we think the
wBEAjjioZFI,1473760,1475679,franchise is going and what we predict
wBEAjjioZFI,1475679,1478559,will be the upcoming dlc nothing is off
