eJ3k6GSFW6E,433,1600,I can’t wait
eJ3k6GSFW6E,2566,3533,to get started here now.
eJ3k6GSFW6E,12166,16733,Servus everyone.  A warm welcome to a new edition of our FC Bayern Vlog.
eJ3k6GSFW6E,16733,21700,"It took a little while. It's holiday time at Säbener Strasse,  the boys were away on international duty and are now on vacation."
eJ3k6GSFW6E,21700,27433,But there’s always something happening at FC Bayern. We've already been able to announce a few new arrivals at Säbener Strasse.
eJ3k6GSFW6E,27433,35533,And we continue today with our marquee signing - Sadio Mané is coming to Munich. I'm going to take you behind the scenes.
eJ3k6GSFW6E,35533,40466,I'll show you how a contract signing at FC Bayern München works.  And now it's about to start.
eJ3k6GSFW6E,40466,46200,"I'll take you to the location, we'll do our preparation, then we'll go to the airport, pick up the player, and go to the medical check."
eJ3k6GSFW6E,46200,50533,"We’ll produce the material for our FCB channels,  and then we'll see what the day brings. "
eJ3k6GSFW6E,50533,55666,"Sadio Mané's first day in Munich, here in the FC Bayern Vlog."
eJ3k6GSFW6E,57466,60433,"Our production team’s already here, they have a lot of equipment with them."
eJ3k6GSFW6E,61233,67933,"We're about to go in here to the hotel, set up a bit,  prepare the location for the shoot later."
eJ3k6GSFW6E,70800,74300,"As for me, I’m off to FC Bayern World in the city centre."
eJ3k6GSFW6E,74300,80200,"I'm going to get some items for Sadio to wear later,  so he'll be standing in front of us in Bayern kit."
eJ3k6GSFW6E,89733,95100,"I've got the kit, now I'm going back to the location.  Let's see how the team’s doing with the set-up."
eJ3k6GSFW6E,109033,112232,I think we’ve chosen the perfect location.
eJ3k6GSFW6E,112233,119100,"A superb view over the most beautiful city in the world, over Munich.  And Sadio can take a look at his new home."
eJ3k6GSFW6E,121966,125700,So this is the interview position where we’ll talk to Sadio later.
eJ3k6GSFW6E,125700,132032,"This is where he’ll sit, on this chair.  And I think this is the best backdrop you can imagine."
eJ3k6GSFW6E,137066,141366,"Here on the set, we’re ready to roll.  Our colleagues are now on their way to the airport to pick up Sadio."
eJ3k6GSFW6E,141366,146265,"Then we’re off to the first part of the medical, we're waiting here for the whole crew. We’re looking forward to Sadio."
eJ3k6GSFW6E,146266,150100,"But for now, here’s some footage of his arrival at the airport and the medical."
eJ3k6GSFW6E,188500,189866,We’ll start with the interviews.
eJ3k6GSFW6E,196900,200666,"Almost everyone is here, we’re only missing one, the star - Sadio Mané."
eJ3k6GSFW6E,200666,206533,"He'll come out down here in a minute, and then we can start our production up here on the roof terrace. I'm looking forward to it!"
eJ3k6GSFW6E,229366,231200,Here he is in a Bayern jersey for the first time.
eJ3k6GSFW6E,235700,236633,I like it!
eJ3k6GSFW6E,242400,245732,We’re done with the production and we’re off to Säbener Strasse.
eJ3k6GSFW6E,245733,251000,We’re now processing the content we created today  so you can watch it on the FCB channels later.
eJ3k6GSFW6E,251000,254966,"As you can see, I think my face got a bit burnt, a bit too much sun."
eJ3k6GSFW6E,254966,260400,"But it was worth it. Sadio went along with everything, he’s so nice  and really had fun with the production."
eJ3k6GSFW6E,260400,266533,"And that's why it's going to be very good content for our channels,  you’ll enjoy it! And now we’re looking at how we create it."
eJ3k6GSFW6E,280833,287733,"Guys, that's it. Day one with Sadio Mané in Munich is over.  We’re now done here at Säbener Strasse."
eJ3k6GSFW6E,287733,292200,We’ve just finished preparing the content that you’ll see on the FCB channels.
eJ3k6GSFW6E,292200,300800,"We had a great photo shoot, we did interviews, we shot a lot of footage -  all perfect content for you out there to watch."
eJ3k6GSFW6E,300800,305832,Day one is over.  It continues tomorrow with the official press conference at the Allianz Arena.
eJ3k6GSFW6E,305833,313733,"We'll be there again, of course, taking you behind the scenes  on day two with Sadio Mané in Munich."
eJ3k6GSFW6E,313733,318066,Now we'll take a break.  And then we'll make sure that tomorrow is at least as good.
eJ3k6GSFW6E,325566,329066,Off we go. Second day with Sadio Mané in Munich. You’ve already seen it.
eJ3k6GSFW6E,329066,336900,"I'm on my way to our living room, the Allianz Arena, where we have the unveiling and press conference today, Sadio will maybe go on a little tour."
eJ3k6GSFW6E,336900,342932,"We still have a few photos, a few video recordings.  And I'll take you behind the scenes as usual. Let's go!"
eJ3k6GSFW6E,353433,359266,"I’m now here in the hallway, this is the way to the changing room. My colleagues are already setting up for the photo shoot later - let's take a look."
eJ3k6GSFW6E,373066,374433,"You've seen the changing room, it's all set up."
eJ3k6GSFW6E,374433,379133,The press conference is about to start here at the Allianz Arena.  We’re now looking into the press conference room.
eJ3k6GSFW6E,445333,446733,Great pic!
eJ3k6GSFW6E,447266,448666,Great pic huh?
eJ3k6GSFW6E,453066,455533,How did you like the press conference? It was very good!
eJ3k6GSFW6E,458433,462133,Your first time as an FC Bayern player. How do you like it?
eJ3k6GSFW6E,462133,464600,"Wow, I love it! Very big stadium."
eJ3k6GSFW6E,464600,465600,Your new home!
eJ3k6GSFW6E,465600,466966,What do you think of the view?
eJ3k6GSFW6E,466966,469866,"Unbelievable, wow!"
eJ3k6GSFW6E,469866,471233,Your new home.
eJ3k6GSFW6E,471233,472400,Yes indeed.
eJ3k6GSFW6E,472400,474133,The Bayern fans call it their living room
eJ3k6GSFW6E,474133,474833,Living room?
eJ3k6GSFW6E,474833,475833,"Yes, exactly."
eJ3k6GSFW6E,475833,476666,OK.
eJ3k6GSFW6E,478266,485300,"I can’t wait to get started now. Left, right... we'll see."
eJ3k6GSFW6E,493866,498666,"Another photo shoot for the club media with Sadio in the Arena,  his first time as an FCB player."
eJ3k6GSFW6E,531700,537666,"There he goes, Sadio Mané. Now he's done here at the Allianz Arena.  A perfect event, the reporters got to know him."
eJ3k6GSFW6E,537666,543800,"We were on the road with him for two days. We got through an incredible amount, he's an exceptionally nice guy. We can definitely say that."
eJ3k6GSFW6E,543800,549066,"And I'm really looking forward to when he plays in front of all of us  for the first time, in there, in this stadium."
eJ3k6GSFW6E,549066,555233,"Training at Säbener Strasse starts in July, and we'll see each other there, when you might also have the chance of seeing Sadio live for the first time."
eJ3k6GSFW6E,555233,558300,"Look forward to it! It's going to be really, really good!"
