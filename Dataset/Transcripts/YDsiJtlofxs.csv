YDsiJtlofxs,48079,49360,let's start off by talking about the
YDsiJtlofxs,49360,52079,swift's design so it's a boxy compact
YDsiJtlofxs,52079,54000,yet cute looking car now this being the
YDsiJtlofxs,54000,54879,sport
YDsiJtlofxs,54879,56719,it is more aggressive looking with a
YDsiJtlofxs,56719,58320,deep rear bumper and you've got twin
YDsiJtlofxs,58320,60239,exhaust pipes and they're real exhaust
YDsiJtlofxs,60239,61760,pipes not only are fake nonsense that
YDsiJtlofxs,61760,63039,you get on volkswagens
YDsiJtlofxs,63039,65760,and nowadays aloe will start at 16
YDsiJtlofxs,65760,67360,inches for the standard car though this
YDsiJtlofxs,67360,67920,sport
YDsiJtlofxs,67920,71119,has 17 inches all important extra inch
YDsiJtlofxs,71119,72640,you've also got some side skirts on the
YDsiJtlofxs,72640,74159,sport and it rides
YDsiJtlofxs,74159,75920,50 millimeters low to the ground than
YDsiJtlofxs,75920,77680,the standard car you can now get
YDsiJtlofxs,77680,79600,the swift with two-tone paint i like
YDsiJtlofxs,79600,81600,that really makes it stand out moving to
YDsiJtlofxs,81600,82159,the front
YDsiJtlofxs,82159,85360,you get led headlights as standard
YDsiJtlofxs,85360,87840,and the sport model gets this deeper
YDsiJtlofxs,87840,88720,front bumper
YDsiJtlofxs,88720,92079,which does look pretty mean
YDsiJtlofxs,92079,93680,the standard car is just a bit more like
YDsiJtlofxs,93680,95360,hello how are you doing still
YDsiJtlofxs,95360,96560,i like the look of both of them it's
YDsiJtlofxs,96560,98159,quite a good looking car i reckon what
YDsiJtlofxs,98159,99280,do you think let me know in the comments
YDsiJtlofxs,99280,102560,below anyway let's check out the inside
YDsiJtlofxs,102560,104240,ah we've got an alarm going off because
YDsiJtlofxs,104240,105840,i've left the ignition on shut up
YDsiJtlofxs,105840,107200,that's better it does feel a little bit
YDsiJtlofxs,107200,109200,cheap in here in fact there's lots of
YDsiJtlofxs,109200,113040,hard out brittle scratchy black plastics
YDsiJtlofxs,113040,115200,like a car from the 1990s
YDsiJtlofxs,115200,117360,look at this it's a bit wobbly as well i
YDsiJtlofxs,117360,119119,guess you get what you don't pay for
YDsiJtlofxs,119119,121119,still i do like the design of it it
YDsiJtlofxs,121119,122159,looks quite cool
YDsiJtlofxs,122159,123920,and this sport version with the red
YDsiJtlofxs,123920,126240,accents they do help liven things
YDsiJtlofxs,126240,127920,up a bit we've got some red stitching
YDsiJtlofxs,127920,129360,here as well and
YDsiJtlofxs,129360,131280,sports steering wheel and the sport
YDsiJtlofxs,131280,133440,seats they're
YDsiJtlofxs,133440,136319,yeah a little bit too body hugging now
YDsiJtlofxs,136319,138400,i'm quite slender guy honestly i like to
YDsiJtlofxs,138400,139280,think i am
YDsiJtlofxs,139280,141680,if you're of a larger disposition you
YDsiJtlofxs,141680,143040,are not going to be able to get in these
YDsiJtlofxs,143040,144480,seats and if you do manage to squeeze
YDsiJtlofxs,144480,144879,yourself
YDsiJtlofxs,144879,146480,in you probably won't be able to extract
YDsiJtlofxs,146480,148080,yourself shame really because the
YDsiJtlofxs,148080,148879,seating position
YDsiJtlofxs,148879,151040,is bang on and there's lots of head
YDsiJtlofxs,151040,152080,rooms it doesn't matter if you're tall
YDsiJtlofxs,152080,152720,and you can
YDsiJtlofxs,152720,154560,put the seat quite far back so if you've
YDsiJtlofxs,154560,156319,got really long legs you'll be fine
YDsiJtlofxs,156319,157920,and you can move the steering wheel up
YDsiJtlofxs,157920,160160,and down quite a bit and in and out
YDsiJtlofxs,160160,162800,you actually can't move it in and out on
YDsiJtlofxs,162800,164400,the models lower down in the
YDsiJtlofxs,164400,166560,swift range seems a bit mean now all
YDsiJtlofxs,166560,168080,cars come with a seven inch touchscreen
YDsiJtlofxs,168080,169040,as standard
YDsiJtlofxs,169040,170720,and it's all right it's quite simple to
YDsiJtlofxs,170720,172640,navigate through the different functions
YDsiJtlofxs,172640,174720,it's a bit old looking though and the
YDsiJtlofxs,174720,176640,graphics are a bit childish and it's not
YDsiJtlofxs,176640,178080,the sharpest definition
YDsiJtlofxs,178080,180000,and only the higher level models get sat
YDsiJtlofxs,180000,181920,nav built in though that doesn't matter
YDsiJtlofxs,181920,183519,because you get android auto and apple
YDsiJtlofxs,183519,184800,carplay is standard and you're just
YDsiJtlofxs,184800,186159,going to hook that up instead
YDsiJtlofxs,186159,188000,that's what i do and you just plug the
YDsiJtlofxs,188000,189200,usb in there
YDsiJtlofxs,189200,191120,no look there's even an old-fashioned
YDsiJtlofxs,191120,192959,auxiliary in if you want that
YDsiJtlofxs,192959,195280,you got 12 volt socket down here as well
YDsiJtlofxs,195280,196319,and then that's where you've got your
YDsiJtlofxs,196319,197599,tray for your mobile phone so you just
YDsiJtlofxs,197599,199040,stick your phone there really
YDsiJtlofxs,199040,200720,keep it out of the way in terms of
YDsiJtlofxs,200720,202400,storage it's okay so you've got some cup
YDsiJtlofxs,202400,203840,holders here and here
YDsiJtlofxs,203840,205519,you've got huge door bins check this out
YDsiJtlofxs,205519,207599,right massive bottle will go
YDsiJtlofxs,207599,209280,in the door bin and there's still some
YDsiJtlofxs,209280,211440,extra space can i fit another
YDsiJtlofxs,211440,213120,bottle in there as well look that's
YDsiJtlofxs,213120,214720,really quite practical good job too
YDsiJtlofxs,214720,216799,because the glove box is basically
YDsiJtlofxs,216799,218959,taken up by the manuals and stuff like
YDsiJtlofxs,218959,221200,that
YDsiJtlofxs,221280,222879,overall though for a small car it's
YDsiJtlofxs,222879,224239,reasonably practical let's check out the
YDsiJtlofxs,224239,226480,back seat shall we
YDsiJtlofxs,226480,228000,so you think this car is going to be
YDsiJtlofxs,228000,229519,really cramped in the rear
YDsiJtlofxs,229519,231519,because it's tiny on the outside but no
YDsiJtlofxs,231519,233360,it's actually surprisingly good
YDsiJtlofxs,233360,235840,headroom's fine knee room is fine
YDsiJtlofxs,235840,237040,there's plenty of space in the foot
YDsiJtlofxs,237040,238480,wells if you need to carry three people
YDsiJtlofxs,238480,239439,at once it's going to be
YDsiJtlofxs,239439,242159,a squeeze because it's a narrow car but
YDsiJtlofxs,242159,244080,it's not terrible because this middle
YDsiJtlofxs,244080,245519,seat is quite comfy
YDsiJtlofxs,245519,247519,and those foot wells are large and
YDsiJtlofxs,247519,248720,there's not too much of a hump in the
YDsiJtlofxs,248720,250000,floor so that is good
YDsiJtlofxs,250000,251439,i tell you what's also good these ice
YDsiJtlofxs,251439,253680,fix anchor points they're quite easy to
YDsiJtlofxs,253680,255120,get to because they've got no covers
YDsiJtlofxs,255120,256400,and there is a decent amount of room
YDsiJtlofxs,256400,258479,back here and the doors open wide enough
YDsiJtlofxs,258479,260720,which means that you don't really
YDsiJtlofxs,260720,261519,struggle too much
YDsiJtlofxs,261519,262720,even when you're fitting one of those
YDsiJtlofxs,262720,264639,rear-facing bulky child seats i'm
YDsiJtlofxs,264639,265360,impressed
YDsiJtlofxs,265360,267600,to be fair a set up is slightly larger
YDsiJtlofxs,267600,268720,in the back and if you want to see my
YDsiJtlofxs,268720,270000,full in-depth video review
YDsiJtlofxs,270000,272000,of that car click on the pop-out banner
YDsiJtlofxs,272000,274240,up there but i am really splitting hairs
YDsiJtlofxs,274240,276400,now in terms of practicality you do have
YDsiJtlofxs,276400,277680,like a little cup holder there which
YDsiJtlofxs,277680,279600,people can fight over there are some
YDsiJtlofxs,279600,280240,other
YDsiJtlofxs,280240,282240,door bin cup holders there but you can
YDsiJtlofxs,282240,284240,only fit one item
YDsiJtlofxs,284240,286880,in them well one bottle in them i like
YDsiJtlofxs,286880,287360,this look
YDsiJtlofxs,287360,288960,real windows go all the way down which
YDsiJtlofxs,288960,291680,is quite unusual these days
YDsiJtlofxs,291680,293120,most kids are just on their ipads aren't
YDsiJtlofxs,293120,294479,they they don't look out the window
YDsiJtlofxs,294479,294960,anymore
YDsiJtlofxs,294960,297600,impressed ow apart from that the roof
YDsiJtlofxs,297600,299120,this is one thing to know the roof does
YDsiJtlofxs,299120,299919,curve in
YDsiJtlofxs,299919,301120,so if you do have three people in the
YDsiJtlofxs,301120,302400,back you are likely to end up if you're
YDsiJtlofxs,302400,303840,in the out seats hitting your head
YDsiJtlofxs,303840,305360,off the roof light or if you're bouncing
YDsiJtlofxs,305360,306560,around in the back of the car like some
YDsiJtlofxs,306560,307919,idiot car review you might smack your
YDsiJtlofxs,307919,309440,head off there
YDsiJtlofxs,309440,311680,on camera embarrassing okay let's talk
YDsiJtlofxs,311680,312880,about the boot
YDsiJtlofxs,312880,314400,so in terms of the load capacity you
YDsiJtlofxs,314400,316720,have 265 liters
YDsiJtlofxs,316720,320080,as a comparison a skoda fabia has 330
YDsiJtlofxs,320080,321360,liters and if you click on the pop-out
YDsiJtlofxs,321360,322240,banner up there
YDsiJtlofxs,322240,323680,you can watch my full in-depth video
YDsiJtlofxs,323680,325840,review of that car anyway back to this
YDsiJtlofxs,325840,326320,boot
YDsiJtlofxs,326320,328000,at least it's a nice square shape so you
YDsiJtlofxs,328000,329759,can squeeze in four
YDsiJtlofxs,329759,332000,airplane size carry-on luggage cases the
YDsiJtlofxs,332000,333120,thing is though there's a huge
YDsiJtlofxs,333120,335919,load lip for you to lift stuff over oh
YDsiJtlofxs,335919,337360,which is a bit annoying
YDsiJtlofxs,337360,338960,what's also annoying is you think oh
YDsiJtlofxs,338960,340160,look i'm gonna have a spare weld under
YDsiJtlofxs,340160,340720,here
YDsiJtlofxs,340720,341919,no you don't you actually just get the
YDsiJtlofxs,341919,344400,car standard with tyre sealant
YDsiJtlofxs,344400,346560,in fact this car is devoid of features
YDsiJtlofxs,346560,347919,in the boot there is
YDsiJtlofxs,347919,350400,just one hawk that's it that's the only
YDsiJtlofxs,350400,351199,feature in the boot
YDsiJtlofxs,351199,353120,that's your lot nothing else obviously
YDsiJtlofxs,353120,354560,if you need to carry larger items you
YDsiJtlofxs,354560,356080,can fold down the rear seats and they
YDsiJtlofxs,356080,356880,split
YDsiJtlofxs,356880,359759,60 40 but then you have a huge ridge
YDsiJtlofxs,359759,361600,here which means that if you're loading
YDsiJtlofxs,361600,363520,really heavy items in it
YDsiJtlofxs,363520,365919,then you're gonna oh find it a nightmare
YDsiJtlofxs,365919,368639,to push them all the way to the front
YDsiJtlofxs,368639,370960,and that brings down to 509 things about
YDsiJtlofxs,370960,372160,the suzuki
YDsiJtlofxs,372160,374880,swift this car is not great for armrests
YDsiJtlofxs,374880,375840,here in the front
YDsiJtlofxs,375840,378479,so while the one the door does have a
YDsiJtlofxs,378479,379520,fabric covering there's
YDsiJtlofxs,379520,382000,zero padding so you end up with an achy
YDsiJtlofxs,382000,382639,elbow
YDsiJtlofxs,382639,384319,and there's not one at all in the center
YDsiJtlofxs,384319,386400,so you're like
YDsiJtlofxs,386400,388720,while it's awesome that suzuki gives all
YDsiJtlofxs,388720,390080,versions of the swift
YDsiJtlofxs,390080,393280,a reversing camera the field of view is
YDsiJtlofxs,393280,394479,pretty limited
YDsiJtlofxs,394479,398800,and the definition is quite frankly
YDsiJtlofxs,398800,400800,well the fact that the vanity mirrors
YDsiJtlofxs,400800,402800,are huge which is ideal if you've got a
YDsiJtlofxs,402800,403919,big head like me
YDsiJtlofxs,403919,405440,it's annoying that they don't have any
YDsiJtlofxs,405440,407680,illumination so you can't check yourself
YDsiJtlofxs,407680,408319,out
YDsiJtlofxs,408319,410160,when it's dark i'm so vain i probably
YDsiJtlofxs,410160,411840,think this video is about me
YDsiJtlofxs,411840,414160,this low cover is just so cheap and
YDsiJtlofxs,414160,415680,flimsy and
YDsiJtlofxs,415680,417919,look at it and there's nowhere to store
YDsiJtlofxs,417919,419280,it underneath
YDsiJtlofxs,419280,420560,the boot floor so you're going to just
YDsiJtlofxs,420560,421919,lay it in there you put stuff on it and
YDsiJtlofxs,421919,423680,then it'd just be damaged so
YDsiJtlofxs,423680,426880,you know what i'm gonna do all the cubby
YDsiJtlofxs,426880,427360,holes
YDsiJtlofxs,427360,430240,where you'd put stuff right there maybe
YDsiJtlofxs,430240,431039,the cup holder
YDsiJtlofxs,431039,433199,or there it's hard brittle plastic
YDsiJtlofxs,433199,435199,that's very shiny and slippy and it has
YDsiJtlofxs,435199,436720,no gripper effect on it so everything
YDsiJtlofxs,436720,437440,just
YDsiJtlofxs,437440,439199,rattles around and you're driving it
YDsiJtlofxs,439199,441039,makes you get angry
YDsiJtlofxs,441039,442639,thankfully this car has plenty of cool
YDsiJtlofxs,442639,444479,features to help make up for all this
YDsiJtlofxs,444479,447280,here's five this little piece of plastic
YDsiJtlofxs,447280,447599,there
YDsiJtlofxs,447599,450960,stops the seat belt from sliding off the
YDsiJtlofxs,450960,452560,seat like when you fold
YDsiJtlofxs,452560,454880,them down so it doesn't end up going
YDsiJtlofxs,454880,455759,behind
YDsiJtlofxs,455759,458240,getting caught hold on suzuki you don't
YDsiJtlofxs,458240,459840,have to wind a ratchet
YDsiJtlofxs,459840,462000,to alter the seat back you just pull up
YDsiJtlofxs,462000,463360,a lever move it into the position you
YDsiJtlofxs,463360,464560,want so if you need to suddenly go to
YDsiJtlofxs,464560,464879,sleeve
YDsiJtlofxs,464879,467919,stick quick look good night
YDsiJtlofxs,467919,469520,the sport model of the swift not only
YDsiJtlofxs,469520,471680,get some red dials it also gets some
YDsiJtlofxs,471680,474000,extra screens on this little display in
YDsiJtlofxs,474000,475680,between the two dials so
YDsiJtlofxs,475680,478000,you get a g-force meter you get torque
YDsiJtlofxs,478000,479440,and power meter of the engine you also
YDsiJtlofxs,479440,481680,get acceleration and brake graphs
YDsiJtlofxs,481680,484240,and turbo boost gauge suzuki has
YDsiJtlofxs,484240,485759,shortened the throw of the manual
YDsiJtlofxs,485759,487280,gearbox by 10
YDsiJtlofxs,487280,489120,and improved the synchromes so it seems
YDsiJtlofxs,489120,491039,even more
YDsiJtlofxs,491039,493520,snickerdy the sport version of the swift
YDsiJtlofxs,493520,495120,not only gets lowered stiff and sport
YDsiJtlofxs,495120,495919,suspension
YDsiJtlofxs,495919,498000,beefier anti-roll bars stronger more
YDsiJtlofxs,498000,500080,powerful brakes but it also has
YDsiJtlofxs,500080,502800,a radiator that's 30 larger than on the
YDsiJtlofxs,502800,503680,normal swiffer
YDsiJtlofxs,503680,505840,improved engine cooling that brings me
YDsiJtlofxs,505840,507520,on to the engine choices and this is
YDsiJtlofxs,507520,510400,going to be dead swift
YDsiJtlofxs,513120,514640,because there's only two choices
YDsiJtlofxs,514640,517039,available with a swift a 1.2 liter or a
YDsiJtlofxs,517039,519120,1.4 litre turbo which is what this car
YDsiJtlofxs,519120,520719,has so the 1.2
YDsiJtlofxs,520719,522719,has 83 horsepower and gets from naught
YDsiJtlofxs,522719,525200,to 60 in 12 seconds which is
YDsiJtlofxs,525200,528800,a bit today this 1.4 has 129 horsepower
YDsiJtlofxs,528800,530480,can i get this out yep and it can go
YDsiJtlofxs,530480,531519,from notch 60
YDsiJtlofxs,531519,533839,in just over nine seconds which is
YDsiJtlofxs,533839,535839,better big news on these engines though
YDsiJtlofxs,535839,536959,is that they're both
YDsiJtlofxs,536959,539440,mild hybrid so they have a beefier
YDsiJtlofxs,539440,541040,starter motor which can not only start
YDsiJtlofxs,541040,542800,the car but can provide a little bit of
YDsiJtlofxs,542800,544560,extra shove when you're driving to help
YDsiJtlofxs,544560,546560,improve the emissions now as standard
YDsiJtlofxs,546560,549120,the car gets a five-speed manual gearbox
YDsiJtlofxs,549120,550720,which is a bit old-fashioned but you can
YDsiJtlofxs,550720,551360,get it with an
YDsiJtlofxs,551360,553279,automatic gearbox this swift sport
YDsiJtlofxs,553279,555440,though has a six-speed manual as
YDsiJtlofxs,555440,556080,standard
YDsiJtlofxs,556080,558480,now the car is front-wheel drive like
YDsiJtlofxs,558480,559839,most hatchbacks
YDsiJtlofxs,559839,562800,however you can get the s85 which is the
YDsiJtlofxs,562800,564320,trim level below the sport
YDsiJtlofxs,564320,566480,with all-wheel drive which is pretty
YDsiJtlofxs,566480,568160,unique for this kind of car
YDsiJtlofxs,568160,569519,okay then let's see what this little
YDsiJtlofxs,569519,571600,suzuki swift is like in town
YDsiJtlofxs,571600,574080,while being small it's dead easy to
YDsiJtlofxs,574080,574959,drive the
YDsiJtlofxs,574959,577040,steering is fairly light the pedals are
YDsiJtlofxs,577040,578000,light as well
YDsiJtlofxs,578000,580560,the brakes aren't too jerky the gear
YDsiJtlofxs,580560,581920,shift is smooth
YDsiJtlofxs,581920,582800,though it does have a bit of a
YDsiJtlofxs,582800,584720,mechanical feel to it however i like
YDsiJtlofxs,584720,585279,that
YDsiJtlofxs,585279,588080,visibility is quite good and it's a
YDsiJtlofxs,588080,588560,fairly
YDsiJtlofxs,588560,590720,maneuverable car so i've got an awkward
YDsiJtlofxs,590720,592160,mini roundabout to do here what i've got
YDsiJtlofxs,592160,593360,to try and get around and there's this
YDsiJtlofxs,593360,594399,lorry pointing out
YDsiJtlofxs,594399,596320,see if i can do it more of a problem for
YDsiJtlofxs,596320,598640,the car in front of me
YDsiJtlofxs,598640,600640,there we go look at this loads of
YDsiJtlofxs,600640,602000,steering lock there's
YDsiJtlofxs,602000,603760,absolutely loads of it we'll get around
YDsiJtlofxs,603760,605600,there don't you worry matey boy
YDsiJtlofxs,605600,609120,yeah look at that so easy
YDsiJtlofxs,609120,611360,one thing that i do notice is that you
YDsiJtlofxs,611360,612880,feel the bumps a little bit in this car
YDsiJtlofxs,612880,614320,it's worse in this version because it's
YDsiJtlofxs,614320,615680,the sport so it's got stiffened
YDsiJtlofxs,615680,616399,suspension
YDsiJtlofxs,616399,618640,but anyway it gets a bit better when
YDsiJtlofxs,618640,620079,you're going quicker
YDsiJtlofxs,620079,622560,but compared to some other small cars it
YDsiJtlofxs,622560,624160,is a bit on the firm side so just be
YDsiJtlofxs,624160,624800,aware of that
YDsiJtlofxs,624800,626560,it's very easy to park though really
YDsiJtlofxs,626560,628320,easy it's the great thing about small
YDsiJtlofxs,628320,629120,cars like this
YDsiJtlofxs,629120,630480,the only problem is that when you're
YDsiJtlofxs,630480,631519,looking over your shoulder there is a
YDsiJtlofxs,631519,633120,bit of a blind spot in that rear three
YDsiJtlofxs,633120,634720,quarters because of that huge back
YDsiJtlofxs,634720,635440,pillar
YDsiJtlofxs,635440,637360,okay let's see what this little swift is
YDsiJtlofxs,637360,639120,like when you get out onto faster roads
YDsiJtlofxs,639120,641519,such as dual carriageways and motorways
YDsiJtlofxs,641519,643440,it's actually all right one thing you do
YDsiJtlofxs,643440,645040,notice though is that when you're going
YDsiJtlofxs,645040,646000,at higher speeds
YDsiJtlofxs,646000,647839,you do get quite a bit of noise from the
YDsiJtlofxs,647839,650240,tires and a bit of wind noise
YDsiJtlofxs,650240,651920,so all you do is turn up the stereo try
YDsiJtlofxs,651920,653440,and pretend they're not really there
YDsiJtlofxs,653440,655519,also being a light car when you've got
YDsiJtlofxs,655519,657680,big crosswinds it does weave about a
YDsiJtlofxs,657680,659600,little bit in lane so you have to hold
YDsiJtlofxs,659600,660959,onto the steering wheel a bit
YDsiJtlofxs,660959,663120,but it's actually okay to be fair though
YDsiJtlofxs,663120,664480,if you want a car
YDsiJtlofxs,664480,667200,to do lots of motorway models in small
YDsiJtlofxs,667200,668399,kite you're going to be better off with
YDsiJtlofxs,668399,669040,something like
YDsiJtlofxs,669040,670880,a volkswagen polo and if you click on
YDsiJtlofxs,670880,672160,the pop-out banner up there you can
YDsiJtlofxs,672160,674079,watch my full in-depth video review
YDsiJtlofxs,674079,676079,of that car one thing i should say about
YDsiJtlofxs,676079,678160,this swift though is that you can get it
YDsiJtlofxs,678160,680160,with the adaptive cruise control which
YDsiJtlofxs,680160,681360,will keep you a safe distance from the
YDsiJtlofxs,681360,683120,car in front which is handy
YDsiJtlofxs,683120,684720,let's see what this little swift is like
YDsiJtlofxs,684720,686480,now on a twisty road
YDsiJtlofxs,686480,688720,being such a light car really pays off
YDsiJtlofxs,688720,690240,for you because it's just so
YDsiJtlofxs,690240,692240,chokeable it's quite a responsive little
YDsiJtlofxs,692240,694399,thing and it grips onto the road so well
YDsiJtlofxs,694399,696000,that's even more so with the sport
YDsiJtlofxs,696000,697680,version with its sportier suspension
YDsiJtlofxs,697680,698399,setup
YDsiJtlofxs,698399,701600,it is a good fun little car not quite as
YDsiJtlofxs,701600,703519,much fun as a ford fiesta it doesn't
YDsiJtlofxs,703519,704399,have quite
YDsiJtlofxs,704399,706640,as much balance or poison in fact if you
YDsiJtlofxs,706640,707839,click on the pop-out banner up there you
YDsiJtlofxs,707839,709360,can watch my full in-depth video review
YDsiJtlofxs,709360,710320,of that car
YDsiJtlofxs,710320,712720,but it's still a bit of a laugh even the
YDsiJtlofxs,712720,713920,normal versions
YDsiJtlofxs,713920,716000,the only thing that's a bit weird is the
YDsiJtlofxs,716000,718079,steering it's almost like there's a
YDsiJtlofxs,718079,720079,spring in between the steering wheel and
YDsiJtlofxs,720079,721839,the wheels because there's like
YDsiJtlofxs,721839,725040,a certain springiness to it
YDsiJtlofxs,725040,727040,still this car doesn't leave much in the
YDsiJtlofxs,727040,728800,bends it's got enough grip and you can
YDsiJtlofxs,728800,729200,tell
YDsiJtlofxs,729200,730959,when the tires start to let go which is
YDsiJtlofxs,730959,732560,good so if you're hooning around
YDsiJtlofxs,732560,734240,you know when you should be backing off
YDsiJtlofxs,734240,736079,i quite like it it's fun it's cheeky and
YDsiJtlofxs,736079,744340,it's cute
YDsiJtlofxs,744340,747279,[Music]
YDsiJtlofxs,747279,749040,so then what's my final verdict on the
YDsiJtlofxs,749040,750399,suzuki swift should you
YDsiJtlofxs,750399,752240,avoid it should he consider it should he
YDsiJtlofxs,752240,754000,shortlist it or should he just go right
YDsiJtlofxs,754000,754560,ahead
YDsiJtlofxs,754560,757440,and buy it well i reckon you should
YDsiJtlofxs,757440,758000,consider
YDsiJtlofxs,758000,761360,the swift it may be cheap but it's still
YDsiJtlofxs,761360,763920,pretty cheerful

YDsiJtlofxs,7040,8800,and it's less expensive than your

YDsiJtlofxs,10240,11920,volkswagen polo you see this thing it
YDsiJtlofxs,11920,13840,starts from just under fifteen thousand
YDsiJtlofxs,13840,14320,pounds

YDsiJtlofxs,48079,49360,let's start off by talking about the
YDsiJtlofxs,49360,52079,swift's design so it's a boxy compact
YDsiJtlofxs,52079,54000,yet cute looking car now this being the
YDsiJtlofxs,54000,54879,sport
YDsiJtlofxs,54879,56719,it is more aggressive looking with a
YDsiJtlofxs,56719,58320,deep rear bumper and you've got twin
YDsiJtlofxs,58320,60239,exhaust pipes and they're real exhaust
YDsiJtlofxs,60239,61760,pipes not only are fake nonsense that
YDsiJtlofxs,61760,63039,you get on volkswagens
YDsiJtlofxs,63039,65760,and nowadays aloe will start at 16
YDsiJtlofxs,65760,67360,inches for the standard car though this
YDsiJtlofxs,67360,67920,sport
YDsiJtlofxs,67920,71119,has 17 inches all important extra inch
YDsiJtlofxs,71119,72640,you've also got some side skirts on the
YDsiJtlofxs,72640,74159,sport and it rides
YDsiJtlofxs,74159,75920,50 millimeters low to the ground than
YDsiJtlofxs,75920,77680,the standard car you can now get
YDsiJtlofxs,77680,79600,the swift with two-tone paint i like
YDsiJtlofxs,79600,81600,that really makes it stand out moving to
YDsiJtlofxs,81600,82159,the front
YDsiJtlofxs,82159,85360,you get led headlights as standard
YDsiJtlofxs,85360,87840,and the sport model gets this deeper
YDsiJtlofxs,87840,88720,front bumper
YDsiJtlofxs,88720,92079,which does look pretty mean
YDsiJtlofxs,92079,93680,the standard car is just a bit more like
YDsiJtlofxs,93680,95360,hello how are you doing still
YDsiJtlofxs,95360,96560,i like the look of both of them it's
YDsiJtlofxs,96560,98159,quite a good looking car i reckon what
YDsiJtlofxs,98159,99280,do you think let me know in the comments
YDsiJtlofxs,99280,102560,below anyway let's check out the inside
YDsiJtlofxs,102560,104240,ah we've got an alarm going off because
YDsiJtlofxs,104240,105840,i've left the ignition on shut up
YDsiJtlofxs,105840,107200,that's better it does feel a little bit
YDsiJtlofxs,107200,109200,cheap in here in fact there's lots of
YDsiJtlofxs,109200,113040,hard out brittle scratchy black plastics
YDsiJtlofxs,113040,115200,like a car from the 1990s
YDsiJtlofxs,115200,117360,look at this it's a bit wobbly as well i
YDsiJtlofxs,117360,119119,guess you get what you don't pay for
YDsiJtlofxs,119119,121119,still i do like the design of it it
YDsiJtlofxs,121119,122159,looks quite cool
YDsiJtlofxs,122159,123920,and this sport version with the red
YDsiJtlofxs,123920,126240,accents they do help liven things
YDsiJtlofxs,126240,127920,up a bit we've got some red stitching
YDsiJtlofxs,127920,129360,here as well and
YDsiJtlofxs,129360,131280,sports steering wheel and the sport
YDsiJtlofxs,131280,133440,seats they're
YDsiJtlofxs,133440,136319,yeah a little bit too body hugging now
YDsiJtlofxs,136319,138400,i'm quite slender guy honestly i like to
YDsiJtlofxs,138400,139280,think i am
YDsiJtlofxs,139280,141680,if you're of a larger disposition you
YDsiJtlofxs,141680,143040,are not going to be able to get in these
YDsiJtlofxs,143040,144480,seats and if you do manage to squeeze
YDsiJtlofxs,144480,144879,yourself
YDsiJtlofxs,144879,146480,in you probably won't be able to extract
YDsiJtlofxs,146480,148080,yourself shame really because the
YDsiJtlofxs,148080,148879,seating position
YDsiJtlofxs,148879,151040,is bang on and there's lots of head
YDsiJtlofxs,151040,152080,rooms it doesn't matter if you're tall
YDsiJtlofxs,152080,152720,and you can
YDsiJtlofxs,152720,154560,put the seat quite far back so if you've
YDsiJtlofxs,154560,156319,got really long legs you'll be fine
YDsiJtlofxs,156319,157920,and you can move the steering wheel up
YDsiJtlofxs,157920,160160,and down quite a bit and in and out
YDsiJtlofxs,160160,162800,you actually can't move it in and out on
YDsiJtlofxs,162800,164400,the models lower down in the
YDsiJtlofxs,164400,166560,swift range seems a bit mean now all
YDsiJtlofxs,166560,168080,cars come with a seven inch touchscreen
YDsiJtlofxs,168080,169040,as standard
YDsiJtlofxs,169040,170720,and it's all right it's quite simple to
YDsiJtlofxs,170720,172640,navigate through the different functions
YDsiJtlofxs,172640,174720,it's a bit old looking though and the
YDsiJtlofxs,174720,176640,graphics are a bit childish and it's not
YDsiJtlofxs,176640,178080,the sharpest definition
YDsiJtlofxs,178080,180000,and only the higher level models get sat
YDsiJtlofxs,180000,181920,nav built in though that doesn't matter
YDsiJtlofxs,181920,183519,because you get android auto and apple
YDsiJtlofxs,183519,184800,carplay is standard and you're just
YDsiJtlofxs,184800,186159,going to hook that up instead
YDsiJtlofxs,186159,188000,that's what i do and you just plug the
YDsiJtlofxs,188000,189200,usb in there
YDsiJtlofxs,189200,191120,no look there's even an old-fashioned
YDsiJtlofxs,191120,192959,auxiliary in if you want that
YDsiJtlofxs,192959,195280,you got 12 volt socket down here as well
YDsiJtlofxs,195280,196319,and then that's where you've got your
YDsiJtlofxs,196319,197599,tray for your mobile phone so you just
YDsiJtlofxs,197599,199040,stick your phone there really
YDsiJtlofxs,199040,200720,keep it out of the way in terms of
YDsiJtlofxs,200720,202400,storage it's okay so you've got some cup
YDsiJtlofxs,202400,203840,holders here and here
YDsiJtlofxs,203840,205519,you've got huge door bins check this out
YDsiJtlofxs,205519,207599,right massive bottle will go
YDsiJtlofxs,207599,209280,in the door bin and there's still some
YDsiJtlofxs,209280,211440,extra space can i fit another
YDsiJtlofxs,211440,213120,bottle in there as well look that's
YDsiJtlofxs,213120,214720,really quite practical good job too
YDsiJtlofxs,214720,216799,because the glove box is basically
YDsiJtlofxs,216799,218959,taken up by the manuals and stuff like
YDsiJtlofxs,218959,221200,that
YDsiJtlofxs,221280,222879,overall though for a small car it's
YDsiJtlofxs,222879,224239,reasonably practical let's check out the
YDsiJtlofxs,224239,226480,back seat shall we
YDsiJtlofxs,226480,228000,so you think this car is going to be
YDsiJtlofxs,228000,229519,really cramped in the rear
YDsiJtlofxs,229519,231519,because it's tiny on the outside but no
YDsiJtlofxs,231519,233360,it's actually surprisingly good
YDsiJtlofxs,233360,235840,headroom's fine knee room is fine
YDsiJtlofxs,235840,237040,there's plenty of space in the foot
YDsiJtlofxs,237040,238480,wells if you need to carry three people
YDsiJtlofxs,238480,239439,at once it's going to be
YDsiJtlofxs,239439,242159,a squeeze because it's a narrow car but
YDsiJtlofxs,242159,244080,it's not terrible because this middle
YDsiJtlofxs,244080,245519,seat is quite comfy
YDsiJtlofxs,245519,247519,and those foot wells are large and
YDsiJtlofxs,247519,248720,there's not too much of a hump in the
YDsiJtlofxs,248720,250000,floor so that is good
YDsiJtlofxs,250000,251439,i tell you what's also good these ice
YDsiJtlofxs,251439,253680,fix anchor points they're quite easy to
YDsiJtlofxs,253680,255120,get to because they've got no covers
YDsiJtlofxs,255120,256400,and there is a decent amount of room
YDsiJtlofxs,256400,258479,back here and the doors open wide enough
YDsiJtlofxs,258479,260720,which means that you don't really
YDsiJtlofxs,260720,261519,struggle too much
YDsiJtlofxs,261519,262720,even when you're fitting one of those
YDsiJtlofxs,262720,264639,rear-facing bulky child seats i'm
YDsiJtlofxs,264639,265360,impressed
YDsiJtlofxs,265360,267600,to be fair a set up is slightly larger
YDsiJtlofxs,267600,268720,in the back and if you want to see my
YDsiJtlofxs,268720,270000,full in-depth video review
YDsiJtlofxs,270000,272000,of that car click on the pop-out banner
YDsiJtlofxs,272000,274240,up there but i am really splitting hairs
YDsiJtlofxs,274240,276400,now in terms of practicality you do have
YDsiJtlofxs,276400,277680,like a little cup holder there which
YDsiJtlofxs,277680,279600,people can fight over there are some
YDsiJtlofxs,279600,280240,other
YDsiJtlofxs,280240,282240,door bin cup holders there but you can
YDsiJtlofxs,282240,284240,only fit one item
YDsiJtlofxs,284240,286880,in them well one bottle in them i like
YDsiJtlofxs,286880,287360,this look
YDsiJtlofxs,287360,288960,real windows go all the way down which
YDsiJtlofxs,288960,291680,is quite unusual these days
YDsiJtlofxs,291680,293120,most kids are just on their ipads aren't
YDsiJtlofxs,293120,294479,they they don't look out the window
YDsiJtlofxs,294479,294960,anymore
YDsiJtlofxs,294960,297600,impressed ow apart from that the roof
YDsiJtlofxs,297600,299120,this is one thing to know the roof does
YDsiJtlofxs,299120,299919,curve in
YDsiJtlofxs,299919,301120,so if you do have three people in the
YDsiJtlofxs,301120,302400,back you are likely to end up if you're
YDsiJtlofxs,302400,303840,in the out seats hitting your head
YDsiJtlofxs,303840,305360,off the roof light or if you're bouncing
YDsiJtlofxs,305360,306560,around in the back of the car like some
YDsiJtlofxs,306560,307919,idiot car review you might smack your
YDsiJtlofxs,307919,309440,head off there
YDsiJtlofxs,309440,311680,on camera embarrassing okay let's talk
YDsiJtlofxs,311680,312880,about the boot
YDsiJtlofxs,312880,314400,so in terms of the load capacity you
YDsiJtlofxs,314400,316720,have 265 liters
YDsiJtlofxs,316720,320080,as a comparison a skoda fabia has 330
YDsiJtlofxs,320080,321360,liters and if you click on the pop-out
YDsiJtlofxs,321360,322240,banner up there
YDsiJtlofxs,322240,323680,you can watch my full in-depth video
YDsiJtlofxs,323680,325840,review of that car anyway back to this
YDsiJtlofxs,325840,326320,boot
YDsiJtlofxs,326320,328000,at least it's a nice square shape so you
YDsiJtlofxs,328000,329759,can squeeze in four
YDsiJtlofxs,329759,332000,airplane size carry-on luggage cases the
YDsiJtlofxs,332000,333120,thing is though there's a huge
YDsiJtlofxs,333120,335919,load lip for you to lift stuff over oh
YDsiJtlofxs,335919,337360,which is a bit annoying
YDsiJtlofxs,337360,338960,what's also annoying is you think oh
YDsiJtlofxs,338960,340160,look i'm gonna have a spare weld under
YDsiJtlofxs,340160,340720,here
YDsiJtlofxs,340720,341919,no you don't you actually just get the
YDsiJtlofxs,341919,344400,car standard with tyre sealant
YDsiJtlofxs,344400,346560,in fact this car is devoid of features
YDsiJtlofxs,346560,347919,in the boot there is
YDsiJtlofxs,347919,350400,just one hawk that's it that's the only
YDsiJtlofxs,350400,351199,feature in the boot
YDsiJtlofxs,351199,353120,that's your lot nothing else obviously
YDsiJtlofxs,353120,354560,if you need to carry larger items you
YDsiJtlofxs,354560,356080,can fold down the rear seats and they
YDsiJtlofxs,356080,356880,split
YDsiJtlofxs,356880,359759,60 40 but then you have a huge ridge
YDsiJtlofxs,359759,361600,here which means that if you're loading
YDsiJtlofxs,361600,363520,really heavy items in it
YDsiJtlofxs,363520,365919,then you're gonna oh find it a nightmare
YDsiJtlofxs,365919,368639,to push them all the way to the front
YDsiJtlofxs,368639,370960,and that brings down to 509 things about
YDsiJtlofxs,370960,372160,the suzuki
YDsiJtlofxs,372160,374880,swift this car is not great for armrests
YDsiJtlofxs,374880,375840,here in the front
YDsiJtlofxs,375840,378479,so while the one the door does have a
YDsiJtlofxs,378479,379520,fabric covering there's
YDsiJtlofxs,379520,382000,zero padding so you end up with an achy
YDsiJtlofxs,382000,382639,elbow
YDsiJtlofxs,382639,384319,and there's not one at all in the center
YDsiJtlofxs,384319,386400,so you're like
YDsiJtlofxs,386400,388720,while it's awesome that suzuki gives all
YDsiJtlofxs,388720,390080,versions of the swift
YDsiJtlofxs,390080,393280,a reversing camera the field of view is
YDsiJtlofxs,393280,394479,pretty limited
YDsiJtlofxs,394479,398800,and the definition is quite frankly
YDsiJtlofxs,398800,400800,well the fact that the vanity mirrors
YDsiJtlofxs,400800,402800,are huge which is ideal if you've got a
YDsiJtlofxs,402800,403919,big head like me
YDsiJtlofxs,403919,405440,it's annoying that they don't have any
YDsiJtlofxs,405440,407680,illumination so you can't check yourself
YDsiJtlofxs,407680,408319,out
YDsiJtlofxs,408319,410160,when it's dark i'm so vain i probably
YDsiJtlofxs,410160,411840,think this video is about me
YDsiJtlofxs,411840,414160,this low cover is just so cheap and
YDsiJtlofxs,414160,415680,flimsy and
YDsiJtlofxs,415680,417919,look at it and there's nowhere to store
YDsiJtlofxs,417919,419280,it underneath
YDsiJtlofxs,419280,420560,the boot floor so you're going to just
YDsiJtlofxs,420560,421919,lay it in there you put stuff on it and
YDsiJtlofxs,421919,423680,then it'd just be damaged so
YDsiJtlofxs,423680,426880,you know what i'm gonna do all the cubby
YDsiJtlofxs,426880,427360,holes
YDsiJtlofxs,427360,430240,where you'd put stuff right there maybe
YDsiJtlofxs,430240,431039,the cup holder
YDsiJtlofxs,431039,433199,or there it's hard brittle plastic
YDsiJtlofxs,433199,435199,that's very shiny and slippy and it has
YDsiJtlofxs,435199,436720,no gripper effect on it so everything
YDsiJtlofxs,436720,437440,just
YDsiJtlofxs,437440,439199,rattles around and you're driving it
YDsiJtlofxs,439199,441039,makes you get angry
YDsiJtlofxs,441039,442639,thankfully this car has plenty of cool
YDsiJtlofxs,442639,444479,features to help make up for all this
YDsiJtlofxs,444479,447280,here's five this little piece of plastic
YDsiJtlofxs,447280,447599,there
YDsiJtlofxs,447599,450960,stops the seat belt from sliding off the
YDsiJtlofxs,450960,452560,seat like when you fold
YDsiJtlofxs,452560,454880,them down so it doesn't end up going
YDsiJtlofxs,454880,455759,behind
YDsiJtlofxs,455759,458240,getting caught hold on suzuki you don't
YDsiJtlofxs,458240,459840,have to wind a ratchet
YDsiJtlofxs,459840,462000,to alter the seat back you just pull up
YDsiJtlofxs,462000,463360,a lever move it into the position you
YDsiJtlofxs,463360,464560,want so if you need to suddenly go to
YDsiJtlofxs,464560,464879,sleeve
YDsiJtlofxs,464879,467919,stick quick look good night
YDsiJtlofxs,467919,469520,the sport model of the swift not only
YDsiJtlofxs,469520,471680,get some red dials it also gets some
YDsiJtlofxs,471680,474000,extra screens on this little display in
YDsiJtlofxs,474000,475680,between the two dials so
YDsiJtlofxs,475680,478000,you get a g-force meter you get torque
YDsiJtlofxs,478000,479440,and power meter of the engine you also
YDsiJtlofxs,479440,481680,get acceleration and brake graphs
YDsiJtlofxs,481680,484240,and turbo boost gauge suzuki has
YDsiJtlofxs,484240,485759,shortened the throw of the manual
YDsiJtlofxs,485759,487280,gearbox by 10
YDsiJtlofxs,487280,489120,and improved the synchromes so it seems
YDsiJtlofxs,489120,491039,even more
YDsiJtlofxs,491039,493520,snickerdy the sport version of the swift
YDsiJtlofxs,493520,495120,not only gets lowered stiff and sport
YDsiJtlofxs,495120,495919,suspension
YDsiJtlofxs,495919,498000,beefier anti-roll bars stronger more
YDsiJtlofxs,498000,500080,powerful brakes but it also has
YDsiJtlofxs,500080,502800,a radiator that's 30 larger than on the
YDsiJtlofxs,502800,503680,normal swiffer
YDsiJtlofxs,503680,505840,improved engine cooling that brings me
YDsiJtlofxs,505840,507520,on to the engine choices and this is
YDsiJtlofxs,507520,510400,going to be dead swift
YDsiJtlofxs,513120,514640,because there's only two choices
YDsiJtlofxs,514640,517039,available with a swift a 1.2 liter or a
YDsiJtlofxs,517039,519120,1.4 litre turbo which is what this car
YDsiJtlofxs,519120,520719,has so the 1.2
YDsiJtlofxs,520719,522719,has 83 horsepower and gets from naught
YDsiJtlofxs,522719,525200,to 60 in 12 seconds which is
YDsiJtlofxs,525200,528800,a bit today this 1.4 has 129 horsepower
YDsiJtlofxs,528800,530480,can i get this out yep and it can go
YDsiJtlofxs,530480,531519,from notch 60
YDsiJtlofxs,531519,533839,in just over nine seconds which is
YDsiJtlofxs,533839,535839,better big news on these engines though
YDsiJtlofxs,535839,536959,is that they're both
YDsiJtlofxs,536959,539440,mild hybrid so they have a beefier
YDsiJtlofxs,539440,541040,starter motor which can not only start
YDsiJtlofxs,541040,542800,the car but can provide a little bit of
YDsiJtlofxs,542800,544560,extra shove when you're driving to help
YDsiJtlofxs,544560,546560,improve the emissions now as standard
YDsiJtlofxs,546560,549120,the car gets a five-speed manual gearbox
YDsiJtlofxs,549120,550720,which is a bit old-fashioned but you can
YDsiJtlofxs,550720,551360,get it with an
YDsiJtlofxs,551360,553279,automatic gearbox this swift sport
YDsiJtlofxs,553279,555440,though has a six-speed manual as
YDsiJtlofxs,555440,556080,standard
YDsiJtlofxs,556080,558480,now the car is front-wheel drive like
YDsiJtlofxs,558480,559839,most hatchbacks
YDsiJtlofxs,559839,562800,however you can get the s85 which is the
YDsiJtlofxs,562800,564320,trim level below the sport
YDsiJtlofxs,564320,566480,with all-wheel drive which is pretty
YDsiJtlofxs,566480,568160,unique for this kind of car
YDsiJtlofxs,568160,569519,okay then let's see what this little
YDsiJtlofxs,569519,571600,suzuki swift is like in town
YDsiJtlofxs,571600,574080,while being small it's dead easy to
YDsiJtlofxs,574080,574959,drive the
YDsiJtlofxs,574959,577040,steering is fairly light the pedals are
YDsiJtlofxs,577040,578000,light as well
YDsiJtlofxs,578000,580560,the brakes aren't too jerky the gear
YDsiJtlofxs,580560,581920,shift is smooth
YDsiJtlofxs,581920,582800,though it does have a bit of a
YDsiJtlofxs,582800,584720,mechanical feel to it however i like
YDsiJtlofxs,584720,585279,that
YDsiJtlofxs,585279,588080,visibility is quite good and it's a
YDsiJtlofxs,588080,588560,fairly
YDsiJtlofxs,588560,590720,maneuverable car so i've got an awkward
YDsiJtlofxs,590720,592160,mini roundabout to do here what i've got
YDsiJtlofxs,592160,593360,to try and get around and there's this
YDsiJtlofxs,593360,594399,lorry pointing out
YDsiJtlofxs,594399,596320,see if i can do it more of a problem for
YDsiJtlofxs,596320,598640,the car in front of me
YDsiJtlofxs,598640,600640,there we go look at this loads of
YDsiJtlofxs,600640,602000,steering lock there's
YDsiJtlofxs,602000,603760,absolutely loads of it we'll get around
YDsiJtlofxs,603760,605600,there don't you worry matey boy
YDsiJtlofxs,605600,609120,yeah look at that so easy
YDsiJtlofxs,609120,611360,one thing that i do notice is that you
YDsiJtlofxs,611360,612880,feel the bumps a little bit in this car
YDsiJtlofxs,612880,614320,it's worse in this version because it's
YDsiJtlofxs,614320,615680,the sport so it's got stiffened
YDsiJtlofxs,615680,616399,suspension
YDsiJtlofxs,616399,618640,but anyway it gets a bit better when
YDsiJtlofxs,618640,620079,you're going quicker
YDsiJtlofxs,620079,622560,but compared to some other small cars it
YDsiJtlofxs,622560,624160,is a bit on the firm side so just be
YDsiJtlofxs,624160,624800,aware of that
YDsiJtlofxs,624800,626560,it's very easy to park though really
YDsiJtlofxs,626560,628320,easy it's the great thing about small
YDsiJtlofxs,628320,629120,cars like this
YDsiJtlofxs,629120,630480,the only problem is that when you're
YDsiJtlofxs,630480,631519,looking over your shoulder there is a
YDsiJtlofxs,631519,633120,bit of a blind spot in that rear three
YDsiJtlofxs,633120,634720,quarters because of that huge back
YDsiJtlofxs,634720,635440,pillar
YDsiJtlofxs,635440,637360,okay let's see what this little swift is
YDsiJtlofxs,637360,639120,like when you get out onto faster roads
YDsiJtlofxs,639120,641519,such as dual carriageways and motorways
YDsiJtlofxs,641519,643440,it's actually all right one thing you do
YDsiJtlofxs,643440,645040,notice though is that when you're going
YDsiJtlofxs,645040,646000,at higher speeds
YDsiJtlofxs,646000,647839,you do get quite a bit of noise from the
YDsiJtlofxs,647839,650240,tires and a bit of wind noise
YDsiJtlofxs,650240,651920,so all you do is turn up the stereo try
YDsiJtlofxs,651920,653440,and pretend they're not really there
YDsiJtlofxs,653440,655519,also being a light car when you've got
YDsiJtlofxs,655519,657680,big crosswinds it does weave about a
YDsiJtlofxs,657680,659600,little bit in lane so you have to hold
YDsiJtlofxs,659600,660959,onto the steering wheel a bit
YDsiJtlofxs,660959,663120,but it's actually okay to be fair though
YDsiJtlofxs,663120,664480,if you want a car
YDsiJtlofxs,664480,667200,to do lots of motorway models in small
YDsiJtlofxs,667200,668399,kite you're going to be better off with
YDsiJtlofxs,668399,669040,something like
YDsiJtlofxs,669040,670880,a volkswagen polo and if you click on
YDsiJtlofxs,670880,672160,the pop-out banner up there you can
YDsiJtlofxs,672160,674079,watch my full in-depth video review
YDsiJtlofxs,674079,676079,of that car one thing i should say about
YDsiJtlofxs,676079,678160,this swift though is that you can get it
YDsiJtlofxs,678160,680160,with the adaptive cruise control which
YDsiJtlofxs,680160,681360,will keep you a safe distance from the
YDsiJtlofxs,681360,683120,car in front which is handy
YDsiJtlofxs,683120,684720,let's see what this little swift is like
YDsiJtlofxs,684720,686480,now on a twisty road
YDsiJtlofxs,686480,688720,being such a light car really pays off
YDsiJtlofxs,688720,690240,for you because it's just so
YDsiJtlofxs,690240,692240,chokeable it's quite a responsive little
YDsiJtlofxs,692240,694399,thing and it grips onto the road so well
YDsiJtlofxs,694399,696000,that's even more so with the sport
YDsiJtlofxs,696000,697680,version with its sportier suspension
YDsiJtlofxs,697680,698399,setup
YDsiJtlofxs,698399,701600,it is a good fun little car not quite as
YDsiJtlofxs,701600,703519,much fun as a ford fiesta it doesn't
YDsiJtlofxs,703519,704399,have quite
YDsiJtlofxs,704399,706640,as much balance or poison in fact if you
YDsiJtlofxs,706640,707839,click on the pop-out banner up there you
YDsiJtlofxs,707839,709360,can watch my full in-depth video review
YDsiJtlofxs,709360,710320,of that car
YDsiJtlofxs,710320,712720,but it's still a bit of a laugh even the
YDsiJtlofxs,712720,713920,normal versions
YDsiJtlofxs,713920,716000,the only thing that's a bit weird is the
YDsiJtlofxs,716000,718079,steering it's almost like there's a
YDsiJtlofxs,718079,720079,spring in between the steering wheel and
YDsiJtlofxs,720079,721839,the wheels because there's like
YDsiJtlofxs,721839,725040,a certain springiness to it
YDsiJtlofxs,725040,727040,still this car doesn't leave much in the
YDsiJtlofxs,727040,728800,bends it's got enough grip and you can
YDsiJtlofxs,728800,729200,tell
YDsiJtlofxs,729200,730959,when the tires start to let go which is
YDsiJtlofxs,730959,732560,good so if you're hooning around
YDsiJtlofxs,732560,734240,you know when you should be backing off
YDsiJtlofxs,734240,736079,i quite like it it's fun it's cheeky and
YDsiJtlofxs,736079,744340,it's cute
YDsiJtlofxs,744340,747279,[Music]
YDsiJtlofxs,747279,749040,so then what's my final verdict on the
YDsiJtlofxs,749040,750399,suzuki swift should you
YDsiJtlofxs,750399,752240,avoid it should he consider it should he
YDsiJtlofxs,752240,754000,shortlist it or should he just go right
YDsiJtlofxs,754000,754560,ahead
YDsiJtlofxs,754560,757440,and buy it well i reckon you should
YDsiJtlofxs,757440,758000,consider
YDsiJtlofxs,758000,761360,the swift it may be cheap but it's still
YDsiJtlofxs,761360,763920,pretty cheerful
