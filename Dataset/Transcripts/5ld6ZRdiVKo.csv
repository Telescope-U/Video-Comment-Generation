5ld6ZRdiVKo,80,3360,hello it is dollar tree time with me
5ld6ZRdiVKo,3360,5440,cookie swirl
5ld6ZRdiVKo,5440,7600,so i actually went to the dollar tree
5ld6ZRdiVKo,7600,9679,and i bought a bunch of things and then
5ld6ZRdiVKo,9679,11360,whenever i came home i was cleaning my
5ld6ZRdiVKo,11360,15120,room and i actually found another dollar
5ld6ZRdiVKo,15120,17520,tree haul bag that i had just hanging
5ld6ZRdiVKo,17520,19520,out in my room so i think i forgot to do
5ld6ZRdiVKo,19520,21520,a dollar tree haul like a while ago so i
5ld6ZRdiVKo,21520,23680,i bought this a long time ago so i don't
5ld6ZRdiVKo,23680,26240,think i ever showed what was in this
5ld6ZRdiVKo,26240,28000,older dollar tree haul so i decided just
5ld6ZRdiVKo,28000,29359,to mix them both together let's just
5ld6ZRdiVKo,29359,31840,dump everything out and see what i found
5ld6ZRdiVKo,31840,33360,at the dollar tree i found a lot of art
5ld6ZRdiVKo,33360,34719,supplies like this right here from
5ld6ZRdiVKo,34719,37120,crafter square it's a stretch canvas
5ld6ZRdiVKo,37120,39120,that's an eight by ten perfect for
5ld6ZRdiVKo,39120,41200,painting anything you want on it so you
5ld6ZRdiVKo,41200,42559,can see the back here it's an actual
5ld6ZRdiVKo,42559,45120,stretched out canvas for just a dollar
5ld6ZRdiVKo,45120,47440,so pretty excited to use this i it says
5ld6ZRdiVKo,47440,49440,excellent for oil and acrylic paints
5ld6ZRdiVKo,49440,52239,another art supply item that i found was
5ld6ZRdiVKo,52239,54800,this sketchbook so it has 50 sheets in
5ld6ZRdiVKo,54800,56800,here so suitable for pencil charcoal
5ld6ZRdiVKo,56800,58640,crown and pen i don't know the quality
5ld6ZRdiVKo,58640,60879,of the paper yet it is made in the usa
5ld6ZRdiVKo,60879,62960,the pages do seem like they're of nice
5ld6ZRdiVKo,62960,64878,quality maybe a little bit thin we'll
5ld6ZRdiVKo,64878,66560,have to test it with some markers so
5ld6ZRdiVKo,66560,68400,really nice little sketch pad so to go
5ld6ZRdiVKo,68400,69920,with the sketch pad i picked up some
5ld6ZRdiVKo,69920,73119,watercolor pencils and some pencils
5ld6ZRdiVKo,73119,74880,these are graphite pencils artist
5ld6ZRdiVKo,74880,77040,quality and then the watercolor pencils
5ld6ZRdiVKo,77040,79040,they come in a rainbow of colors very
5ld6ZRdiVKo,79040,81280,excited to use these ones too love the
5ld6ZRdiVKo,81280,83439,black just kind of nice and sleek i also
5ld6ZRdiVKo,83439,85360,found some neon colored pencils again
5ld6ZRdiVKo,85360,87360,i'm not sure of the quality i also
5ld6ZRdiVKo,87360,89360,picked up a bunch of markers i love
5ld6ZRdiVKo,89360,92159,horses i love the netflix series spirit
5ld6ZRdiVKo,92159,94079,writing free it's an animated series so
5ld6ZRdiVKo,94079,96000,i found these markers i think they
5ld6ZRdiVKo,96000,97520,changed the art style so i don't know if
5ld6ZRdiVKo,97520,98799,you can find these ones at the dollar
5ld6ZRdiVKo,98799,100400,tree anymore but you can see spirit
5ld6ZRdiVKo,100400,102159,there with the old art style i'll
5ld6ZRdiVKo,102159,103680,probably never open these these ones i'm
5ld6ZRdiVKo,103680,105360,just gonna keep in my collection just
5ld6ZRdiVKo,105360,106880,because they're so cute and i'm always
5ld6ZRdiVKo,106880,109200,collecting cute things now these markers
5ld6ZRdiVKo,109200,110799,have interesting shapes we've got
5ld6ZRdiVKo,110799,113840,flowers and line markers so let's get
5ld6ZRdiVKo,113840,115520,out that sketch pad let's test out the
5ld6ZRdiVKo,115520,117200,line marker first you can see the
5ld6ZRdiVKo,117200,119200,grooves there so whenever you drag it
5ld6ZRdiVKo,119200,120479,across the paper that it's going to give
5ld6ZRdiVKo,120479,124079,those lines so take it press and drag to
5ld6ZRdiVKo,124079,125600,create your line i think this could be
5ld6ZRdiVKo,125600,127119,really cool to create like borders and
5ld6ZRdiVKo,127119,129360,things like if you do like scrapbooking
5ld6ZRdiVKo,129360,131920,or a scrap journal even on your calendar
5ld6ZRdiVKo,131920,133760,i love how that turned out so those
5ld6ZRdiVKo,133760,135680,actually worked very nicely now let's
5ld6ZRdiVKo,135680,137760,test out the little flower stampers so
5ld6ZRdiVKo,137760,139440,you can actually see the little flower
5ld6ZRdiVKo,139440,141440,shape oh there we go okay you can see it
5ld6ZRdiVKo,141440,142800,kind of hard to get it to focus but
5ld6ZRdiVKo,142800,143840,there you go you should be able to see
5ld6ZRdiVKo,143840,145599,the shape so depending on how you press
5ld6ZRdiVKo,145599,147200,these is going to determine how the
5ld6ZRdiVKo,147200,149599,flower quality is take the pink one give
5ld6ZRdiVKo,149599,151120,it a little stamp and there you go the
5ld6ZRdiVKo,151120,153280,paper does bleed a bit so that was kind
5ld6ZRdiVKo,153280,155840,of a bold stamp than the green that
5ld6ZRdiVKo,155840,157920,looks beautiful blue
5ld6ZRdiVKo,157920,158959,okay
5ld6ZRdiVKo,158959,160480,i could have pressed a little harder
5ld6ZRdiVKo,160480,161760,purple
5ld6ZRdiVKo,161760,163200,and again i think these would be great
5ld6ZRdiVKo,163200,164800,for like oh that one really did bleed
5ld6ZRdiVKo,164800,166640,though these ones would be really good
5ld6ZRdiVKo,166640,168319,for like your calendar and just like
5ld6ZRdiVKo,168319,170400,maybe stamping some things that's what i
5ld6ZRdiVKo,170400,171840,plan to use them for
5ld6ZRdiVKo,171840,173599,oh the yellow looks really nice really
5ld6ZRdiVKo,173599,175120,like the shapes on those and you can
5ld6ZRdiVKo,175120,176640,kind of see how much it bled on the
5ld6ZRdiVKo,176640,179040,paper so the paper is thin it looks like
5ld6ZRdiVKo,179040,181120,it only bled through one of the pages it
5ld6ZRdiVKo,181120,182879,was completely blank on the bottom but
5ld6ZRdiVKo,182879,184400,it did bleed through the paper
5ld6ZRdiVKo,184400,185760,underneath just something to keep in
5ld6ZRdiVKo,185760,187440,mind and then i picked up some scented
5ld6ZRdiVKo,187440,189920,markers because why not so you got apple
5ld6ZRdiVKo,189920,192239,strawberry grape lemon and blueberry so
5ld6ZRdiVKo,192239,194640,you can definitely smell them but really
5ld6ZRdiVKo,194640,196000,whenever you start writing with them
5ld6ZRdiVKo,196000,197680,that's actually when you activate the
5ld6ZRdiVKo,197680,199360,smell so as i was riding with them and
5ld6ZRdiVKo,199360,200800,then gave the marker a little sniff
5ld6ZRdiVKo,200800,202159,that's when you can actually get the
5ld6ZRdiVKo,202159,204159,true smell to come in so just activate
5ld6ZRdiVKo,204159,205440,them a little bit then i found some just
5ld6ZRdiVKo,205440,206959,good old white out i remember white out
5ld6ZRdiVKo,206959,208879,being really expensive but now it's at
5ld6ZRdiVKo,208879,211040,the dollar tree ah what are these cushy
5ld6ZRdiVKo,211040,214080,grips soft and cushy you always need fun
5ld6ZRdiVKo,214080,215920,pins right so these ones was a hamburger
5ld6ZRdiVKo,215920,217599,and fries and it actually looks like it
5ld6ZRdiVKo,217599,219280,had ketchup and the hamburgers were all
5ld6ZRdiVKo,219280,220640,stacked together on there found some
5ld6ZRdiVKo,220640,222720,puffy stickers rainbow and a little
5ld6ZRdiVKo,222720,224640,heart eye emoji and if you kind of tilt
5ld6ZRdiVKo,224640,226159,the sticker they've got like that snow
5ld6ZRdiVKo,226159,228560,globe effect where you can actually see
5ld6ZRdiVKo,228560,230799,the glitter kind of confetti and fall
5ld6ZRdiVKo,230799,232000,and it's kind of hard to tell but
5ld6ZRdiVKo,232000,233920,they're actually puffy perfect i love
5ld6ZRdiVKo,233920,235840,putting these like on a journal just to

5ld6ZRdiVKo,258479,259759,especially since it looks like you just
5ld6ZRdiVKo,259759,261280,lay the stencil on your nail and then
5ld6ZRdiVKo,261280,263040,you just paint over with nail polish to
5ld6ZRdiVKo,263040,265199,create that really interesting stencil
