DsBIA61xtaI,240,2480,well what we have witnessed today uh in
DsBIA61xtaI,2480,3919,front of the american people is
DsBIA61xtaI,3919,5040,something
DsBIA61xtaI,5040,6720,we have not seen before and we have said
DsBIA61xtaI,6720,8000,this a number of times after these
DsBIA61xtaI,8000,9679,hearings but this is this is quite
DsBIA61xtaI,9679,10639,different
DsBIA61xtaI,10639,12240,you're looking a young woman named
DsBIA61xtaI,12240,14160,cassidy hutchinson who worked directly
DsBIA61xtaI,14160,16000,for former chief of staff mark meadows
DsBIA61xtaI,16000,17920,in the trump white house
DsBIA61xtaI,17920,19920,she was a very loyal member of the trump
DsBIA61xtaI,19920,21920,administration she testified that it was
DsBIA61xtaI,21920,23279,her job to
DsBIA61xtaI,23279,25119,to remind the american people of the
DsBIA61xtaI,25119,27760,policies the victories within the trump
DsBIA61xtaI,27760,28880,white house
DsBIA61xtaI,28880,30640,she talked in the second part of the
DsBIA61xtaI,30640,31920,hearing about
DsBIA61xtaI,31920,33840,how hurtful it was
DsBIA61xtaI,33840,35520,when the former president tweeted about
DsBIA61xtaI,35520,37760,mike pence that he did not have the
DsBIA61xtaI,37760,40239,courage to do what needed to be done
DsBIA61xtaI,40239,42239,in that moment she said she took it
DsBIA61xtaI,42239,43600,personally
DsBIA61xtaI,43600,45200,and we heard testimony that several
DsBIA61xtaI,45200,47280,other members of the trump white house
DsBIA61xtaI,47280,49039,felt the same way
DsBIA61xtaI,49039,50960,in that moment
DsBIA61xtaI,50960,52239,those were
DsBIA61xtaI,52239,54480,the minutes the hours in fact when they
DsBIA61xtaI,54480,56320,were urging the former president to do
DsBIA61xtaI,56320,58399,something about the mob over at the
DsBIA61xtaI,58399,59600,capitol
DsBIA61xtaI,59600,61120,she talked about walking down to the
DsBIA61xtaI,61120,63440,oval office to find her boss mark
DsBIA61xtaI,63440,64478,meadows
DsBIA61xtaI,64478,66240,who was in the dining room the personal
DsBIA61xtaI,66240,68000,dining room right off of the oval office
DsBIA61xtaI,68000,69520,we've talked about that room before
DsBIA61xtaI,69520,70960,where the former president would often
DsBIA61xtaI,70960,72880,watch television
DsBIA61xtaI,72880,75040,and mark meadows had gone to to talk
DsBIA61xtaI,75040,76720,with the former president she came to
DsBIA61xtaI,76720,78560,the doorway because i believe she said
DsBIA61xtaI,78560,79920,at the time jim jordan member of
DsBIA61xtaI,79920,81600,congress was on the phone
DsBIA61xtaI,81600,83280,wanted to talk to mark meadows and she
DsBIA61xtaI,83280,85119,said when she passed the phone to her
DsBIA61xtaI,85119,87600,boss mark meadows she could then hear
DsBIA61xtaI,87600,89040,the other part of the conversation
DsBIA61xtaI,89040,91840,playing out in that personal dining room
DsBIA61xtaI,91840,94320,the news of the chants that were taking
DsBIA61xtaI,94320,96079,place over at the capitol
DsBIA61xtaI,96079,98640,the hang mike pence chance
DsBIA61xtaI,98640,100479,she then testified before the american
DsBIA61xtaI,100479,102560,people about
DsBIA61xtaI,102560,105439,her disbelief and her sadness
DsBIA61xtaI,105439,107439,that the president did not defend his
DsBIA61xtaI,107439,109520,former vice president in that moment did
DsBIA61xtaI,109520,111439,not act immediately
DsBIA61xtaI,111439,114240,to protect the vice president when it
DsBIA61xtaI,114240,116320,was clear the former president knew and
DsBIA61xtaI,116320,119200,was fully aware of the chance to hang
DsBIA61xtaI,119200,121360,mike pence we'll get into what she said
DsBIA61xtaI,121360,123439,in the second half here in just a moment
DsBIA61xtaI,123439,125280,but just the broader picture the
DsBIA61xtaI,125280,127200,reaction coming in
DsBIA61xtaI,127200,129920,from members of the republican party and
DsBIA61xtaI,129920,133120,from members of trump's inner circle
DsBIA61xtaI,133120,135200,we got reaction from mark meadows
DsBIA61xtaI,135200,136800,predecessor now her boss was mark
DsBIA61xtaI,136800,138640,meadows the former chief of staff and
DsBIA61xtaI,138640,141280,the chief of staff before meadows was
DsBIA61xtaI,141280,142400,mick mulvaney
DsBIA61xtaI,142400,144000,and he tweeted out
DsBIA61xtaI,144000,146160,during testimony this afternoon my guess
DsBIA61xtaI,146160,148239,is that before this is over we will be
DsBIA61xtaI,148239,150800,hearing testimony from ornato engel
DsBIA61xtaI,150800,153360,meadows of course ordo the deputy chief
DsBIA61xtaI,153360,155440,of staff meadows mark meadows engel the
DsBIA61xtaI,155440,157120,secret service agent tasked with
DsBIA61xtaI,157120,159280,protecting the president he was the one
DsBIA61xtaI,159280,161920,she testified that the president
DsBIA61xtaI,161920,164400,you know essentially reached for in the
DsBIA61xtaI,164400,166879,beast which is that the the main car for
DsBIA61xtaI,166879,169040,the president obviously in the motorcade
DsBIA61xtaI,169040,170720,mulvaney goes on to say in that tweet
DsBIA61xtaI,170720,172640,you see there he he tweets this is
DsBIA61xtaI,172640,174400,explosive stuff
DsBIA61xtaI,174400,176400,if cassidy is making this up they will
DsBIA61xtaI,176400,178720,need to say that if she isn't they will
DsBIA61xtaI,178720,180959,have to corroborate and he goes on to
DsBIA61xtaI,180959,182239,write and this is the key line of the
DsBIA61xtaI,182239,185360,tweet that will make news beyond beyond
DsBIA61xtaI,185360,187760,us right here he wrote i know her i
DsBIA61xtaI,187760,189760,don't think she's lying i want to bring
DsBIA61xtaI,189760,191120,in our chief washington correspondent
DsBIA61xtaI,191120,192480,jonathan carl
DsBIA61xtaI,192480,196239,john the weight of this testimony today

DsBIA61xtaI,206080,208080,house have been willing to do come out
DsBIA61xtaI,208080,211599,publicly freely and to tell the truth

DsBIA61xtaI,213920,215680,mulvaney there raises a very good
DsBIA61xtaI,215680,218080,question uh pat cipollone is another

DsBIA61xtaI,224319,226400,counsel you have a very good
DsBIA61xtaI,226400,228319,claim on executive privilege but these
DsBIA61xtaI,228319,230799,are extraordinary circumstances isn't it
DsBIA61xtaI,230799,233439,time for pat sipoloni to come forward
DsBIA61xtaI,233439,235599,and tell in his words what he witnessed
DsBIA61xtaI,235599,237519,on that day the way john dean who was
DsBIA61xtaI,237519,239280,also the white house counsel
DsBIA61xtaI,239280,241599,did during the watergate hearings when
DsBIA61xtaI,241599,244319,he told the truth about his interactions
DsBIA61xtaI,244319,246640,with richard nixon the two secret
DsBIA61xtaI,246640,248480,service agents uh
DsBIA61xtaI,248480,251599,robert engel the lead agent on
DsBIA61xtaI,251599,253120,president trump

DsBIA61xtaI,255120,257680,was a secret service agent he took leave
DsBIA61xtaI,257680,259519,uh to be the deputy chief of staff now
DsBIA61xtaI,259519,261280,he is again a secret service agent now
DsBIA61xtaI,261280,263120,there is a great tradition of secret
DsBIA61xtaI,263120,265919,service agents uh you know keeping to
DsBIA61xtaI,265919,267520,themselves about this for obvious
DsBIA61xtaI,267520,268639,reasons but again these are
DsBIA61xtaI,268639,271120,extraordinary times they were witness to
DsBIA61xtaI,271120,273360,extraordinary events will they come
DsBIA61xtaI,273360,275840,forward and will they tell their story
DsBIA61xtaI,275840,277840,about what they saw
DsBIA61xtaI,277840,281120,this was this was by far david
DsBIA61xtaI,281120,283520,the biggest and most consequential
DsBIA61xtaI,283520,285840,of these uh january 6th hearings and as
DsBIA61xtaI,285840,287919,you know we've witnessed before this
DsBIA61xtaI,287919,290320,five very big inconsequential hearings
DsBIA61xtaI,290320,292720,uh this was at another level
DsBIA61xtaI,292720,294240,that's the big picture of you and john i
DsBIA61xtaI,294240,296400,want to ask you about one key piece of
DsBIA61xtaI,296400,298000,testimony in the second half and we'll
DsBIA61xtaI,298000,299600,dissect it all a little later on world
DsBIA61xtaI,299600,301199,news tonight but in the meantime john
DsBIA61xtaI,301199,302880,you heard this
DsBIA61xtaI,302880,305120,cassidy hutchinson describing after she
DsBIA61xtaI,305120,307120,had gone to the personal dining room off
DsBIA61xtaI,307120,308479,of the oval
DsBIA61xtaI,308479,309840,heard that the former president was
DsBIA61xtaI,309840,312639,aware of these chants to hang mike pence
DsBIA61xtaI,312639,315039,this was uh not long after that she was
DsBIA61xtaI,315039,316240,back
DsBIA61xtaI,316240,318800,near her office her post just outside
DsBIA61xtaI,318800,320320,mark meadow's office
DsBIA61xtaI,320320,322080,white house counsel comes down the
DsBIA61xtaI,322080,323039,hallway
DsBIA61xtaI,323039,325440,says to mark meadows mark we need to do
DsBIA61xtaI,325440,327039,something here they're literally calling
DsBIA61xtaI,327039,330560,for the vice president to be blank hung
DsBIA61xtaI,330560,332479,mark had responded something to the
DsBIA61xtaI,332479,334160,effect of well you heard him pat
DsBIA61xtaI,334160,335680,referring to the former president
DsBIA61xtaI,335680,338639,president trump he thinks mike deserves
DsBIA61xtaI,338639,339360,it
DsBIA61xtaI,339360,340880,he doesn't think they're doing anything
DsBIA61xtaI,340880,343120,wrong
DsBIA61xtaI,343520,345759,and david there was more even beyond
DsBIA61xtaI,345759,348560,that when they uh you know with the
DsBIA61xtaI,348560,350400,people around pat cipolloni and others
DsBIA61xtaI,350400,351759,around the president said he had to come
DsBIA61xtaI,351759,354080,out and do another statement on january
DsBIA61xtaI,354080,356160,7th the day after the attack
DsBIA61xtaI,356160,357840,to finally do what he had failed to do
DsBIA61xtaI,357840,360160,on january 6 which is to condemn the
DsBIA61xtaI,360160,361039,attack
DsBIA61xtaI,361039,363360,she characterized the donald trump's
DsBIA61xtaI,363360,366080,view at this point was that the rioters
DsBIA61xtaI,366080,367520,themselves those that attacked the
DsBIA61xtaI,367520,369120,building didn't do anything wrong the
DsBIA61xtaI,369120,370720,only person that did something wrong on
DsBIA61xtaI,370720,373520,that day was mike pence
DsBIA61xtaI,373520,374639,and then
DsBIA61xtaI,374639,377280,the the committee uh mentioned something
DsBIA61xtaI,377280,379840,that still to this day blows me away an
DsBIA61xtaI,379840,382880,interview that i had with donald trump
DsBIA61xtaI,382880,384720,about six weeks after he left the white
DsBIA61xtaI,384720,386720,house where i asked him about those hang
DsBIA61xtaI,386720,389680,mike pence chants and even then
DsBIA61xtaI,389680,391440,he refused to condemn
DsBIA61xtaI,391440,393520,the people calling for his vice
DsBIA61xtaI,393520,396560,president's execution saying it's common
DsBIA61xtaI,396560,397520,sense
DsBIA61xtaI,397520,399440,how can you pass on a fraudulent vote in
DsBIA61xtaI,399440,402720,other words he was defending explaining
DsBIA61xtaI,402720,405440,rationalizing uh the the chance of the
DsBIA61xtaI,405440,409199,people that were saying hang mike pence
DsBIA61xtaI,409199,411280,we remember that conversation well john
DsBIA61xtaI,411280,413520,the audio from that conversation
DsBIA61xtaI,413520,414720,the interview you had with the former
DsBIA61xtaI,414720,416639,president after he left office our john
DsBIA61xtaI,416639,418240,carl our thanks to you i want to bring
DsBIA61xtaI,418240,420479,in mary bruce over at the white house
DsBIA61xtaI,420479,422800,covered congress extensively during the
DsBIA61xtaI,422800,424639,trump administration mary how much
DsBIA61xtaI,424639,427280,pressure now on these former members of
DsBIA61xtaI,427280,430800,trump's inner circle to testify to give
DsBIA61xtaI,430800,432720,their version of this to somehow either
DsBIA61xtaI,432720,434639,say what cassidy hutchinson said today
DsBIA61xtaI,434639,437520,was not the truth or to acknowledge that
DsBIA61xtaI,437520,439759,she has described accurately what played
DsBIA61xtaI,439759,442000,out in those final hours
DsBIA61xtaI,442000,443440,the big question david is whether this
DsBIA61xtaI,443440,445280,is going to be a turning point and you
DsBIA61xtaI,445280,446080,heard
DsBIA61xtaI,446080,447919,the chairman there raising this question
DsBIA61xtaI,447919,450000,whether her testimony will encourage
DsBIA61xtaI,450000,451919,others whether whether it will jog their
DsBIA61xtaI,451919,454160,memory or encourage them to come forth
DsBIA61xtaI,454160,456080,now and be willing to speak more
DsBIA61xtaI,456080,458160,publicly that's the big question but the
DsBIA61xtaI,458160,460319,pressure still remains that these
DsBIA61xtaI,460319,462080,members of congress especially who have
DsBIA61xtaI,462080,464319,been very close with the trump camp with
DsBIA61xtaI,464319,466000,the former president there is still a
DsBIA61xtaI,466000,467599,lot of pressure on them not to break
DsBIA61xtaI,467599,470000,with donald trump donald trump is still
DsBIA61xtaI,470000,471520,for all intents and purposes the leader
DsBIA61xtaI,471520,473199,of the republican party and he has a
DsBIA61xtaI,473199,475759,huge sway and power over the republican
DsBIA61xtaI,475759,478720,party and whether or not this testimony
DsBIA61xtaI,478720,481280,will impact that remains to be seen and
DsBIA61xtaI,481280,483039,david we should say we are also hearing
DsBIA61xtaI,483039,484720,from donald trump it seems he has been
DsBIA61xtaI,484720,487520,paying uh rather close attention today
DsBIA61xtaI,487520,489440,yes he said he did not know cassidy
DsBIA61xtaI,489440,490879,hutchinson but
DsBIA61xtaI,490879,492560,mary you know the inner workings of the
DsBIA61xtaI,492560,494080,white house very well they were
DsBIA61xtaI,494080,495520,effective the committee in putting up
DsBIA61xtaI,495520,498000,that map of the west wing showing it's
DsBIA61xtaI,498000,499840,just a few steps uh
DsBIA61xtaI,499840,502000,from literally where cassidy hutchinson
DsBIA61xtaI,502000,503919,sat outside mark meadows office to get
DsBIA61xtaI,503919,505360,to the oval there you see what they had
DsBIA61xtaI,505360,507680,prepped for the american people today uh
DsBIA61xtaI,507680,509520,difficult to believe that the former
DsBIA61xtaI,509520,511199,president had had
DsBIA61xtaI,511199,513200,knew little about her or a little knew
DsBIA61xtaI,513200,514719,little of her
DsBIA61xtaI,514719,516560,that would be almost impossible i mean
DsBIA61xtaI,516560,517680,given i can tell you i'm right outside
DsBIA61xtaI,517680,520000,the western wing right now it is a very
DsBIA61xtaI,520000,521919,tight space given how closely she worked
DsBIA61xtaI,521919,523760,with mark meadows for many years and in
DsBIA61xtaI,523760,525839,the west wing the fact that donald trump
DsBIA61xtaI,525839,528000,didn't know her is very hard to believe
DsBIA61xtaI,528000,529920,and he is putting out some messages
DsBIA61xtaI,529920,532080,responding to some of her testimony he's
DsBIA61xtaI,532080,533519,saying he never complained about the
DsBIA61xtaI,533519,536080,crowd size that day at his rally which
DsBIA61xtaI,536080,538160,she noted as part of her explanation for
DsBIA61xtaI,538160,540880,why he wanted uh them to not be to be
DsBIA61xtaI,540880,542560,able to wave going through the mags
DsBIA61xtaI,542560,544480,despite the fact that they had some of
DsBIA61xtaI,544480,546800,them were found with weapons on them he
DsBIA61xtaI,546800,548959,also says it's false to say that he
DsBIA61xtaI,548959,551040,tried to grab the steering wheel as she
DsBIA61xtaI,551040,553040,recounted um her understanding that he
DsBIA61xtaI,553040,554399,tried to grab the steering wheel as they
DsBIA61xtaI,554399,556080,were heading uh towards the capitol
DsBIA61xtaI,556080,557760,because donald trump was so intent on
DsBIA61xtaI,557760,559600,getting up there that day he said that's
DsBIA61xtaI,559600,561600,sick and fraudulent the former president
DsBIA61xtaI,561600,562880,also saying it was ridiculous that he
DsBIA61xtaI,562880,565440,threw food uh he was so frustrated with
DsBIA61xtaI,565440,568240,the attorney general's response about
DsBIA61xtaI,568240,569519,the election results but david what he
DsBIA61xtaI,569519,571440,is not taking issue with are the claims
DsBIA61xtaI,571440,573360,that he knew that the crowd was going to
DsBIA61xtaI,573360,575040,be violent and that he did nothing to
DsBIA61xtaI,575040,576640,stop them very interesting to point that
DsBIA61xtaI,576640,578000,out mary bruce our thanks to you and
DsBIA61xtaI,578000,579440,again part of that message from the
DsBIA61xtaI,579440,581200,former president i hardly know who this
DsBIA61xtaI,581200,583120,person cassidy hutchinson
DsBIA61xtaI,583120,584640,is and again mary pointing out that she
DsBIA61xtaI,584640,586160,was just a couple of steps from the oval
DsBIA61xtaI,586160,588399,and not only that she testified today
DsBIA61xtaI,588399,590640,that she was in so many words proud of
DsBIA61xtaI,590640,592080,her role
DsBIA61xtaI,592080,593839,celebrating the victories the policy
DsBIA61xtaI,593839,595519,achievements of the trump administration
DsBIA61xtaI,595519,597760,was a very very loyal member of that
DsBIA61xtaI,597760,600320,team loyal to mark meadows to the former
DsBIA61xtaI,600320,602399,president to mike pence and she talked
DsBIA61xtaI,602399,603360,about
DsBIA61xtaI,603360,605920,in particular what it meant as the the
DsBIA61xtaI,605920,608480,chance grew louder to hang mike pence uh
DsBIA61xtaI,608480,610240,how she felt when the former president
DsBIA61xtaI,610240,612079,tweeted out that mike pence did not have
DsBIA61xtaI,612079,614480,the courage to do what was needed to be
DsBIA61xtaI,614480,615760,done as
DsBIA61xtaI,615760,617360,so many around the former president were
DsBIA61xtaI,617360,619600,urging him to do something to stop what
DsBIA61xtaI,619600,621360,was playing out i want to bring in
DsBIA61xtaI,621360,623440,pierre thomas because the other piece of
DsBIA61xtaI,623440,626640,testimony today that that stands out
DsBIA61xtaI,626640,628640,among so many key points that cassidy
DsBIA61xtaI,628640,629920,hutchinson shared with the american
DsBIA61xtaI,629920,631440,people that we had not heard before but
DsBIA61xtaI,631440,632959,that one
DsBIA61xtaI,632959,635440,storyline the narrative of the motorcade
DsBIA61xtaI,635440,637920,leaving that rally in the morning
DsBIA61xtaI,637920,640320,that multiple law enforcement agencies
DsBIA61xtaI,640320,642480,had already told the former president's
DsBIA61xtaI,642480,643839,inner circle that
DsBIA61xtaI,643839,646079,that this had begun to unfold the chaos
DsBIA61xtaI,646079,649200,it was uh unstable at the capitol they
DsBIA61xtaI,649200,650880,they told the president the secret
DsBIA61xtaI,650880,652320,service charged with protecting the
DsBIA61xtaI,652320,654079,president the particular agent in the
DsBIA61xtaI,654079,655680,beast with him that's what they call
DsBIA61xtaI,655680,657839,obviously the vehicle that the president
DsBIA61xtaI,657839,660000,travels in told him it is simply not
DsBIA61xtaI,660000,660800,safe
DsBIA61xtaI,660800,662560,to bring you up to the capitol mr
DsBIA61xtaI,662560,665360,president in so many words the president
DsBIA61xtaI,665360,668399,then as described by cassidy hutchinson
DsBIA61xtaI,668399,669440,lunging
DsBIA61xtaI,669440,671839,in so many words for that agent in a
DsBIA61xtaI,671839,673279,moment of
DsBIA61xtaI,673279,675920,rage as she described it inside the
DsBIA61xtaI,675920,678640,beast you know the secret service um you
DsBIA61xtaI,678640,680000,know they've taken their hits through
DsBIA61xtaI,680000,682240,the years and their critiques uh but one
DsBIA61xtaI,682240,683839,thing you cannot say is that they're not
DsBIA61xtaI,683839,686000,loyal to the presidents and first
DsBIA61xtaI,686000,688399,families that they serve
DsBIA61xtaI,688399,689920,indeed david and i
DsBIA61xtaI,689920,692560,have reached out to a senior official
DsBIA61xtaI,692560,693519,who
DsBIA61xtaI,693519,696160,will not comment specifically on the
DsBIA61xtaI,696160,698399,altercation but did say
DsBIA61xtaI,698399,700240,flatly that
DsBIA61xtaI,700240,702000,the president had wanted to go to
DsBIA61xtaI,702000,704000,capitol hill and that the secret service
DsBIA61xtaI,704000,707040,rejected that request by the president
DsBIA61xtaI,707040,709200,of the united states now david as you
DsBIA61xtaI,709200,710959,point out the secret service is loathe
DsBIA61xtaI,710959,713040,to talk about the interpersonal and
DsBIA61xtaI,713040,715680,direct relationships uh with the white
DsBIA61xtaI,715680,717440,house and the president in particular
DsBIA61xtaI,717440,720079,but in this case i think mr ingle is
DsBIA61xtaI,720079,722000,going to be under incredible pressure to
DsBIA61xtaI,722000,724880,say whether this in fact did happen and
DsBIA61xtaI,724880,727200,the other thing david to note is as you
DsBIA61xtaI,727200,729279,pointed out this notion that the
DsBIA61xtaI,729279,732480,security situation was getting worse and
DsBIA61xtaI,732480,734639,worse as time went on during the course
DsBIA61xtaI,734639,737519,of that morning and that day you have
DsBIA61xtaI,737519,740560,law enforcement officials the day before
DsBIA61xtaI,740560,741360,the
DsBIA61xtaI,741360,743839,insurrection january 6 warning about the
DsBIA61xtaI,743839,746079,potential that the capital itself might
DsBIA61xtaI,746079,747680,be a target
DsBIA61xtaI,747680,749680,david the fact that so little was done
DsBIA61xtaI,749680,751519,to prepare for it and david we learned
DsBIA61xtaI,751519,753200,today that they
DsBIA61xtaI,753200,755720,had evidence of a man in a tree with an
DsBIA61xtaI,755720,758800,ar-15 assault style rifle now whether
DsBIA61xtaI,758800,760639,they found that person or not that
DsBIA61xtaI,760639,763120,should have set off a series of very
DsBIA61xtaI,763120,765279,robust efforts to
DsBIA61xtaI,765279,767120,calm the crowd and get the president out
DsBIA61xtaI,767120,769360,of there yeah that was extraordinary
DsBIA61xtaI,769360,771680,congresswoman cheney playing some of the
DsBIA61xtaI,771680,773519,messages that were coming into dispatch
DsBIA61xtaI,773519,775120,from members of law enforcement
DsBIA61xtaI,775120,776320,witnessing
DsBIA61xtaI,776320,777760,what they said were
DsBIA61xtaI,777760,779920,at least a couple of instances involving
DsBIA61xtaI,779920,783040,ar-15 style assault rifles there at the
DsBIA61xtaI,783040,785279,capitol as this was all beginning to
DsBIA61xtaI,785279,787120,unfold and pierre one quick question to
DsBIA61xtaI,787120,788880,you before we move on and we're about to
DsBIA61xtaI,788880,790399,wrap up our coverage here but pierre i
DsBIA61xtaI,790399,791839,did want to ask you because
DsBIA61xtaI,791839,793519,congresswoman liz cheney at the very
DsBIA61xtaI,793519,795519,beginning of this hearing today
DsBIA61xtaI,795519,798320,methodically went over uh a number of
DsBIA61xtaI,798320,800800,agencies now they face a real critique
DsBIA61xtaI,800800,802480,for not having been prepared or getting
DsBIA61xtaI,802480,803839,the information out to the american
DsBIA61xtaI,803839,806079,people well in advance given the
DsBIA61xtaI,806079,808240,intelligence that something dangerous
DsBIA61xtaI,808240,810880,could happen on january 6th but she did
DsBIA61xtaI,810880,812160,make the point today pointing to
DsBIA61xtaI,812160,814639,evidence that they have obtained as the
DsBIA61xtaI,814639,815680,as the committee has been doing their
DsBIA61xtaI,815680,818079,work for nearly a year now that multiple
DsBIA61xtaI,818079,820160,agencies warned this white house from
DsBIA61xtaI,820160,822560,the capitol police to the secret service
DsBIA61xtaI,822560,825360,uh in the days leading up to january 6
DsBIA61xtaI,825360,828320,that this could turn very dangerous
DsBIA61xtaI,828320,830160,david one of the the great mysteries
DsBIA61xtaI,830160,832480,about all of this is given this
DsBIA61xtaI,832480,834240,intelligence that the capitol police had
DsBIA61xtaI,834240,836560,the secret service had concern
DsBIA61xtaI,836560,838560,other agencies were getting bits of
DsBIA61xtaI,838560,841040,information that the crowd that was
DsBIA61xtaI,841040,842720,going to be there to support trump
DsBIA61xtaI,842720,845120,wasn't necessarily simply going to fight
DsBIA61xtaI,845120,847199,the counter protesters antifa if you
DsBIA61xtaI,847199,849519,will but that they were there to perhaps
DsBIA61xtaI,849519,851600,target the capital itself and the fact
DsBIA61xtaI,851600,853440,that so little was done david is one of
DsBIA61xtaI,853440,855360,the big mysteries that we still fully
DsBIA61xtaI,855360,857279,don't have all the answers to questions
DsBIA61xtaI,857279,859199,about why nothing was done and questions
DsBIA61xtaI,859199,861279,now for trump's inner circle now that
DsBIA61xtaI,861279,862639,there's been testimony before the
DsBIA61xtaI,862639,864160,american people that they at least had
DsBIA61xtaI,864160,865440,been told if the american people didn't
DsBIA61xtaI,865440,866560,know about it
DsBIA61xtaI,866560,868399,certainly the former white house did
DsBIA61xtaI,868399,870000,know of the intelligence from multiple
DsBIA61xtaI,870000,872320,agencies our thanks to you pierre uh two
DsBIA61xtaI,872320,874160,more questions before we go sarah isker
DsBIA61xtaI,874160,876000,who we talked to uh during the break the
DsBIA61xtaI,876000,877920,recess before i want to come back to her
DsBIA61xtaI,877920,879360,a former spokesperson with the trump
DsBIA61xtaI,879360,880880,department of justice and obviously an
DsBIA61xtaI,880880,882560,abc news contributor now sarah i'm
DsBIA61xtaI,882560,884639,curious when when you read that mick
DsBIA61xtaI,884639,886639,mulvaney tweet as well we reported it on
DsBIA61xtaI,886639,888639,the air that he said my guess is that
DsBIA61xtaI,888639,890240,before this is over we will be hearing
DsBIA61xtaI,890240,892639,testimony from renato engel meadows
DsBIA61xtaI,892639,894399,members of trump's inner circle in these
DsBIA61xtaI,894399,895839,final hours
DsBIA61xtaI,895839,898320,because he says this is explosive stuff
DsBIA61xtaI,898320,901920,i know her i don't think she's lying
DsBIA61xtaI,901920,903279,what do you make of what he tweeted do
DsBIA61xtaI,903279,904720,you agree with him that we should see
DsBIA61xtaI,904720,907360,others come forward now
DsBIA61xtaI,907360,908800,i absolutely think we'll see a lot of
DsBIA61xtaI,908800,910720,pressure for those folks to testify and
DsBIA61xtaI,910720,912160,either rebut what she said or
DsBIA61xtaI,912160,914800,corroborate it right now everything is
DsBIA61xtaI,914800,916880,relying on cassidy hutchison's
DsBIA61xtaI,916880,918720,credibility we have no reason to
DsBIA61xtaI,918720,920240,question her at this point and in fact
DsBIA61xtaI,920240,922720,we're not seeing other republicans or
DsBIA61xtaI,922720,924880,other members of trump's inner circle
DsBIA61xtaI,924880,926639,rebut these claims
DsBIA61xtaI,926639,929519,and so yes she carried herself off as a
DsBIA61xtaI,929519,931839,patriot with a lot of credibility i
DsBIA61xtaI,931839,933519,think we will see more people come
DsBIA61xtaI,933519,935920,forward and corroborate what she said
DsBIA61xtaI,935920,937519,our thanks to sarah isker here with us
DsBIA61xtaI,937519,939199,this afternoon terry moran i want to
DsBIA61xtaI,939199,940079,come to you senior national
DsBIA61xtaI,940079,941519,correspondent of course terry's covered
DsBIA61xtaI,941519,944000,multiple administrations in washington
DsBIA61xtaI,944000,946480,uh big picture here a couple of key
DsBIA61xtaI,946480,948000,things that we learned today this moment
DsBIA61xtaI,948000,949279,in the beast which we don't have to go
DsBIA61xtaI,949279,950720,back over this this tension with the
DsBIA61xtaI,950720,952720,secret service agent but this this
DsBIA61xtaI,952720,955199,notion that the president was aware of
DsBIA61xtaI,955199,957360,of the violence of the cast beginning to
DsBIA61xtaI,957360,959759,unfold at the capitol uh and still very
DsBIA61xtaI,959759,962399,much wanted to go to the capitol we mark
DsBIA61xtaI,962399,964240,meadows had written that this was
DsBIA61xtaI,964240,965759,metaphorically speaking the president
DsBIA61xtaI,965759,967519,said i'll be there with you
DsBIA61xtaI,967519,969519,in a sense uh you know i support what
DsBIA61xtaI,969519,970800,what you're headed there to do the
DsBIA61xtaI,970800,972480,message you want to send
DsBIA61xtaI,972480,974079,today we learned before the american
DsBIA61xtaI,974079,976480,people from multiple pieces of evidence
DsBIA61xtaI,976480,978720,that were displayed that the president
DsBIA61xtaI,978720,980079,did want to go and not only that he was
DsBIA61xtaI,980079,983199,in the motorcade and became enraged when
DsBIA61xtaI,983199,985279,the secret service told him that he
DsBIA61xtaI,985279,986800,simply couldn't because of security
DsBIA61xtaI,986800,988000,reasons
DsBIA61xtaI,988000,990000,that is also a profound development here
DsBIA61xtaI,990000,992079,today from the committee
DsBIA61xtaI,992079,994320,it is david it's astonishing it's
DsBIA61xtaI,994320,996320,shocking it's one of the most shocking
DsBIA61xtaI,996320,998240,scenes in the history of the american
DsBIA61xtaI,998240,999839,presidency and it's checkable it's a
DsBIA61xtaI,999839,1001440,checkable fact there were other people
DsBIA61xtaI,1001440,1002639,in that car
DsBIA61xtaI,1002639,1005199,the testimony of cassidy hutchison is is
DsBIA61xtaI,1005199,1007680,a moment in american history she takes
DsBIA61xtaI,1007680,1009440,the american people into the inner
DsBIA61xtaI,1009440,1011839,circle directly an eyewitness a
DsBIA61xtaI,1011839,1014720,participant in discussions on the day
DsBIA61xtaI,1014720,1017279,the capital was attacked and in the days
DsBIA61xtaI,1017279,1019040,leading up to it and one of the details
DsBIA61xtaI,1019040,1021040,that you just mentioned donald trump was
DsBIA61xtaI,1021040,1023279,planning that day to go to capitol hill
DsBIA61xtaI,1023279,1025918,against what his own white house council
DsBIA61xtaI,1025918,1028000,was advising because for a president who
DsBIA61xtaI,1028000,1028880,had
DsBIA61xtaI,1028880,1029918,lost
DsBIA61xtaI,1029918,1032720,the election as certified by the 50
DsBIA61xtaI,1032720,1034959,sovereign states of this country to
DsBIA61xtaI,1034959,1037438,basically go to the capitol to rally or
DsBIA61xtaI,1037438,1040000,demand the presidency be awarded to him
DsBIA61xtaI,1040000,1042240,say nothing of inciting what he knew was
DsBIA61xtaI,1042240,1045280,an armed crowd they won't hurt me
DsBIA61xtaI,1045280,1048319,he said uh it was just almost almost
DsBIA61xtaI,1048319,1049360,incredible i think one of the things
DsBIA61xtaI,1049360,1051679,that today did was for a lot of
DsBIA61xtaI,1051679,1053360,americans who thought about january 6
DsBIA61xtaI,1053360,1055200,they were sad they were disgusted by it
DsBIA61xtaI,1055200,1056559,they thought well that's chaos that's
DsBIA61xtaI,1056559,1058960,trump's chaos yeah people got out of
DsBIA61xtaI,1058960,1061120,hand he's he was

DsBIA61xtaI,1071840,1073600,determined to go
DsBIA61xtaI,1073600,1076160,not not just physically but arranging
DsBIA61xtaI,1076160,1079280,and organizing and orchestrating a mob
DsBIA61xtaI,1079280,1081600,to attack the capital so he could seize
DsBIA61xtaI,1081600,1082720,the power
DsBIA61xtaI,1082720,1084320,that the 50 sovereign states had given

DsBIA61xtaI,1126880,1129280,presidency good characters lousy
DsBIA61xtaI,1129280,1130400,characters

DsBIA61xtaI,1132080,1133120,mad
DsBIA61xtaI,1133120,1135280,in in what we heard in the description
DsBIA61xtaI,1135280,1137679,of donald trump today something deeply
DsBIA61xtaI,1137679,1140960,dangerous morally and psychologically
DsBIA61xtaI,1140960,1142400,terry moran watching the hearings with

DsBIA61xtaI,1149200,1150400,washington correspondent of course
DsBIA61xtaI,1150400,1151760,watching this every step of the way with
DsBIA61xtaI,1151760,1154240,us john you heard congresswoman liz
DsBIA61xtaI,1154240,1156000,cheney vice chair of the committee there
DsBIA61xtaI,1156000,1157120,at the end
DsBIA61xtaI,1157120,1159600,talk about the intimidation the pressure
DsBIA61xtaI,1159600,1161200,put on these witnesses there have been
DsBIA61xtaI,1161200,1163280,so few willing to come forward today and
DsBIA61xtaI,1163280,1164799,we've talked about this at length here
DsBIA61xtaI,1164799,1166880,this afternoon that cassidy hutchinson
DsBIA61xtaI,1166880,1168640,is young she had
DsBIA61xtaI,1168640,1170799,likely still has a very bright future
DsBIA61xtaI,1170799,1173280,ahead of her but she a lot is at stake
DsBIA61xtaI,1173280,1174880,in coming forward today she testified
DsBIA61xtaI,1174880,1176160,how loyal she was to the trump
DsBIA61xtaI,1176160,1178160,administration how proud she was of the
DsBIA61xtaI,1178160,1179520,policies of the
DsBIA61xtaI,1179520,1181600,the victories the achievements they had
DsBIA61xtaI,1181600,1182880,and and
DsBIA61xtaI,1182880,1185840,and how personally
DsBIA61xtaI,1185840,1187840,hurt she was particularly in those
DsBIA61xtaI,1187840,1189600,moments of hang mike pence that the
DsBIA61xtaI,1189600,1191919,former president wasn't doing more to
DsBIA61xtaI,1191919,1194000,stop what was playing out in washington
DsBIA61xtaI,1194000,1195760,and that she became scared was the word
DsBIA61xtaI,1195760,1197440,i believe she used after that
DsBIA61xtaI,1197440,1199280,conversation with rudy giuliani on an
DsBIA61xtaI,1199280,1200960,evening a couple of days prior to
DsBIA61xtaI,1200960,1203280,january 6. but when you see what liz
DsBIA61xtaI,1203280,1204720,cheney put up there before the american
DsBIA61xtaI,1204720,1207120,people and these were different examples
DsBIA61xtaI,1207120,1207840,from
DsBIA61xtaI,1207840,1211360,a wide array of witnesses phone calls
DsBIA61xtaI,1211360,1213120,communications with them
DsBIA61xtaI,1213120,1215840,from other members close to the former
DsBIA61xtaI,1215840,1218080,president essentially telling them
DsBIA61xtaI,1218080,1220799,putting pressure on them be careful if
DsBIA61xtaI,1220799,1222320,you will
DsBIA61xtaI,1222320,1224240,there was a clear effort according to
DsBIA61xtaI,1224240,1226640,liz cheney to intimidate
DsBIA61xtaI,1226640,1228799,previous witnesses before this committee
DsBIA61xtaI,1228799,1231039,in those depositions the language
DsBIA61xtaI,1231039,1232799,frankly sounding like it's straight out
DsBIA61xtaI,1232799,1235840,of a mafia intimidation campaign
DsBIA61xtaI,1235840,1237520,warning those who are testifying that
DsBIA61xtaI,1237520,1239280,the president the former president reads
DsBIA61xtaI,1239280,1241200,transcripts you don't want to be off
DsBIA61xtaI,1241200,1242559,team trump
DsBIA61xtaI,1242559,1244159,liz cheney did not mention which
DsBIA61xtaI,1244159,1245840,witnesses received
DsBIA61xtaI,1245840,1247760,these threats she said there were
DsBIA61xtaI,1247760,1249120,several of them and she said the
DsBIA61xtaI,1249120,1250880,committee would be investigating them
DsBIA61xtaI,1250880,1253520,clearly an effort to try to tamper with
DsBIA61xtaI,1253520,1256080,these witnesses that in and of itself a
DsBIA61xtaI,1256080,1257280,crime
DsBIA61xtaI,1257280,1258640,david so this is something they're
DsBIA61xtaI,1258640,1260799,looking into and it's a reason why this
DsBIA61xtaI,1260799,1263039,hearing happened on such short notice
DsBIA61xtaI,1263039,1264880,and with such secrecy
DsBIA61xtaI,1264880,1266400,they were really worried that there
DsBIA61xtaI,1266400,1268080,would be an effort to get to cassidy
DsBIA61xtaI,1268080,1271520,hutchinson to try to intimidate her
DsBIA61xtaI,1271520,1273360,and convince her not to testify
DsBIA61xtaI,1273360,1274720,fortunately
DsBIA61xtaI,1274720,1277280,for all of us who got to see what
DsBIA61xtaI,1277280,1279600,she saw on january 6th
