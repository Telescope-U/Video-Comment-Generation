PkujpWzHrpA,399,4320,welcome back to brain candy tv
PkujpWzHrpA,7040,10160,hey brainiacs do you know what a planet
PkujpWzHrpA,10160,11440,is
PkujpWzHrpA,11440,14480,planets are big balls of rock or huge
PkujpWzHrpA,14480,18400,balls of gas that move around a star
PkujpWzHrpA,18400,21119,a star is an even bigger ball of glowing
PkujpWzHrpA,21119,24720,gas and the star that's closest to us is
PkujpWzHrpA,24720,27119,called the sun
PkujpWzHrpA,27119,29679,we live on one of the rocky planets and
PkujpWzHrpA,29679,32640,we call that planet earth
PkujpWzHrpA,32640,34559,do you know where on planet earth you
PkujpWzHrpA,34559,35840,live
PkujpWzHrpA,35840,39760,hey that's where lizzy lives
PkujpWzHrpA,39920,42640,alright this is gonna be fun
PkujpWzHrpA,42640,44960,here comes a big space train with models
PkujpWzHrpA,44960,47840,of all the planets in our solar system
PkujpWzHrpA,47840,50160,let's join lizzy on the planet's train
PkujpWzHrpA,50160,53920,to learn a bit about each planet
PkujpWzHrpA,54239,57680,the closest planet to the sun is mercury
PkujpWzHrpA,57680,61280,it's very small and mostly made of rock
PkujpWzHrpA,61280,64158,daytime on mercury is really hot but the
PkujpWzHrpA,64158,67040,nights are super cold giving mercury the
PkujpWzHrpA,67040,68960,biggest temperature range of all the
PkujpWzHrpA,68960,71960,planets
PkujpWzHrpA,72320,75520,the second planet from the sun is venus
PkujpWzHrpA,75520,77920,unlike mercury it's covered in a thick
PkujpWzHrpA,77920,80400,layer of clouds and it's the hottest
PkujpWzHrpA,80400,82960,planet in our solar system
PkujpWzHrpA,82960,85600,the surface of venus is so hot that it
PkujpWzHrpA,85600,87759,could cook a whole pizza in only three
PkujpWzHrpA,87759,91119,to seven seconds
PkujpWzHrpA,92400,94479,the third planet from the sun is called
PkujpWzHrpA,94479,95439,earth
PkujpWzHrpA,95439,97600,the one we all live on
PkujpWzHrpA,97600,99439,it's the only planet we know of that
PkujpWzHrpA,99439,101920,contains life but scientists are
PkujpWzHrpA,101920,104000,constantly looking for signs of life on
PkujpWzHrpA,104000,106799,other planets
PkujpWzHrpA,107439,110479,the next planet is mars it's covered in
PkujpWzHrpA,110479,112640,rocks and dust and is about half the
PkujpWzHrpA,112640,114560,size of planet earth
PkujpWzHrpA,114560,116479,we hope to send people to mars by the
PkujpWzHrpA,116479,118240,year 2035
PkujpWzHrpA,118240,121119,or maybe even sooner
PkujpWzHrpA,121119,124640,next up is the gas giant jupiter
PkujpWzHrpA,124640,126640,it's the biggest planet in our solar
PkujpWzHrpA,126640,129679,system and it's so big you could fit
PkujpWzHrpA,129679,134720,around 1300 earths inside of it
PkujpWzHrpA,135360,137920,saturn is the second largest gas giant
PkujpWzHrpA,137920,140400,planet and it has a beautiful ring
PkujpWzHrpA,140400,143440,system around it these rings are made up
PkujpWzHrpA,143440,146879,of millions of chunks of rock and dice
PkujpWzHrpA,146879,149599,the seventh planet is uranus and it has
PkujpWzHrpA,149599,151760,a smaller ring system
PkujpWzHrpA,151760,153680,scientists think it may have been hit by
PkujpWzHrpA,153680,156239,an earth-sized planet a long time ago
PkujpWzHrpA,156239,158400,which might be why it's the only planet
PkujpWzHrpA,158400,161519,tilted on its side
PkujpWzHrpA,162560,164640,the eighth and farthest planet from the
PkujpWzHrpA,164640,167120,sun is neptune
PkujpWzHrpA,167120,169280,even though uranus can sometimes reach
PkujpWzHrpA,169280,170879,colder temperatures
PkujpWzHrpA,170879,172879,neptune has the coldest average
PkujpWzHrpA,172879,175200,temperature because it's so far from the
PkujpWzHrpA,175200,176400,sun
PkujpWzHrpA,176400,179120,it's also the windiest planet with winds
PkujpWzHrpA,179120,182400,up to 1300 miles per hour which is
PkujpWzHrpA,182400,184640,almost 10 times as strong as the most
PkujpWzHrpA,184640,188000,powerful hurricanes on earth
PkujpWzHrpA,188000,189920,and those are the eight planets in our
PkujpWzHrpA,189920,191519,solar system
PkujpWzHrpA,191519,193360,there used to be a ninth planet called
PkujpWzHrpA,193360,196080,pluto but now it's called a dwarf planet
PkujpWzHrpA,196080,199040,because it's so small even smaller than
PkujpWzHrpA,199040,200879,earth's moon
PkujpWzHrpA,200879,202800,we just got our first high quality
PkujpWzHrpA,202800,206159,photos of pluto in the summer of 2015
PkujpWzHrpA,206159,208480,when we sent a spacecraft to fly close
PkujpWzHrpA,208480,209599,by
PkujpWzHrpA,209599,211680,there are at least four other dwarf
PkujpWzHrpA,211680,212560,planets
PkujpWzHrpA,212560,214640,and many more smaller objects in our
PkujpWzHrpA,214640,217599,solar system
PkujpWzHrpA,218640,220959,there's a big difference in the sizes of
PkujpWzHrpA,220959,222480,the planets
PkujpWzHrpA,222480,224560,let's take a look at all eight planets
PkujpWzHrpA,224560,227440,plus pluto in their actual scales next
PkujpWzHrpA,227440,229280,to each other
PkujpWzHrpA,229280,232159,there's tiny mercury
PkujpWzHrpA,232159,235439,hot and cloudy venus
PkujpWzHrpA,235439,238480,earth and its moon
PkujpWzHrpA,239360,242400,dusty mars
PkujpWzHrpA,242400,243200,whoa
PkujpWzHrpA,243200,247200,and there's gigantic jupiter
PkujpWzHrpA,247200,250000,saturn with all of its rings
PkujpWzHrpA,250000,252720,uranus and neptune
PkujpWzHrpA,252720,254879,and there's the itty bitty dwarf planet
PkujpWzHrpA,254879,256320,pluto
PkujpWzHrpA,256320,259120,but of course all these planets are tiny
PkujpWzHrpA,259120,262720,when compared to the size of the sun
PkujpWzHrpA,262720,264560,we've learned a lot about the planets
PkujpWzHrpA,264560,266639,over the past hundred years but we're
PkujpWzHrpA,266639,268560,learning more every day
PkujpWzHrpA,268560,271520,and there's still a lot left to explore
PkujpWzHrpA,271520,273759,who knows maybe one of you will get to
PkujpWzHrpA,273759,277360,visit some of these planets one day
PkujpWzHrpA,277360,279759,stay tuned we'll be back after these
PkujpWzHrpA,279759,282759,messages
PkujpWzHrpA,284560,286720,hey brainiacs
PkujpWzHrpA,286720,288560,have you ever been for a ride on an
PkujpWzHrpA,288560,292240,airplane it's so much fun
PkujpWzHrpA,292240,295120,airplanes can fly way up in the sky
PkujpWzHrpA,295120,297600,even higher than the clouds
PkujpWzHrpA,297600,300000,and they can take you to far-off places
PkujpWzHrpA,300000,302080,all around the world
PkujpWzHrpA,302080,303600,today we're going to learn about the
PkujpWzHrpA,303600,305759,different parts of an airplane and how
PkujpWzHrpA,305759,308000,they work together to make it fly up in
PkujpWzHrpA,308000,311160,the sky
PkujpWzHrpA,311440,313600,here we are at the airport where we can
PkujpWzHrpA,313600,316720,find all kinds of cool airplanes
PkujpWzHrpA,316720,319360,look all the parts of that airplane are
PkujpWzHrpA,319360,321600,ready to be put together
PkujpWzHrpA,321600,323520,let's see if we can put all the parts in
PkujpWzHrpA,323520,325520,the right spot
PkujpWzHrpA,325520,328720,the biggest part is called the fuselage
PkujpWzHrpA,328720,330880,that's where you and all the passengers
PkujpWzHrpA,330880,332720,will sit
PkujpWzHrpA,332720,334720,next we have the wings
PkujpWzHrpA,334720,339160,do you know which parts are the wings
PkujpWzHrpA,339919,341600,there they are
PkujpWzHrpA,341600,344080,these wings are a very special shape
PkujpWzHrpA,344080,346080,that helps the airplane fly up through
PkujpWzHrpA,346080,349240,the sky
PkujpWzHrpA,349390,352479,[Music]
PkujpWzHrpA,352479,354560,under the wings we'll find the jet
PkujpWzHrpA,354560,357120,engines
PkujpWzHrpA,357120,360560,this big airplane has four engines
PkujpWzHrpA,360560,363280,the engines push the airplane forward so
PkujpWzHrpA,363280,366000,it can go really fast
PkujpWzHrpA,366000,368240,beneath the wings and fuselage we can
PkujpWzHrpA,368240,370639,find the landing gear
PkujpWzHrpA,370639,372960,the landing gear has wheels so the
PkujpWzHrpA,372960,375039,airplane can roll along the runway
PkujpWzHrpA,375039,378170,during takeoff and landing
PkujpWzHrpA,378170,381230,[Music]
PkujpWzHrpA,382240,384319,at the back of the airplane we'll find
PkujpWzHrpA,384319,386319,the stabilizers
PkujpWzHrpA,386319,388720,these stabilizers help keep the airplane
PkujpWzHrpA,388720,390030,flying straight
PkujpWzHrpA,390030,393120,[Music]
PkujpWzHrpA,393120,394720,now that our airplane is all put
PkujpWzHrpA,394720,397520,together let's hop on board and learn
PkujpWzHrpA,397520,398500,how it works
PkujpWzHrpA,398500,401120,[Music]
PkujpWzHrpA,401120,404000,hey captain lizzy are you ready to take
PkujpWzHrpA,404000,406560,us for a ride on this new airplane
PkujpWzHrpA,406560,408960,all right here we are at the front of
PkujpWzHrpA,408960,411599,the airplane and this area is called the
PkujpWzHrpA,411599,413120,flight deck
PkujpWzHrpA,413120,415039,the flight deck is where the captain
PkujpWzHrpA,415039,417520,sits and controls the plane
PkujpWzHrpA,417520,419680,let's explore the flight deck and learn
PkujpWzHrpA,419680,421840,some of the things the captain uses to
PkujpWzHrpA,421840,424160,control the airplane
PkujpWzHrpA,424160,426160,this is the throttle
PkujpWzHrpA,426160,428240,the throttle controls the thrust of the
PkujpWzHrpA,428240,429360,engines
PkujpWzHrpA,429360,431759,that's what makes the airplane go faster
PkujpWzHrpA,431759,434560,or slower
PkujpWzHrpA,434960,436720,here is the yolk
PkujpWzHrpA,436720,438639,the yolk is like the steering wheel of
PkujpWzHrpA,438639,439690,an airplane
PkujpWzHrpA,439690,442800,[Music]
PkujpWzHrpA,442800,445840,the rudder pedals found here also help
PkujpWzHrpA,445840,449970,captain lizzie steer the airplane
PkujpWzHrpA,449970,451840,[Music]
PkujpWzHrpA,451840,453840,the instrument panels have lots of
PkujpWzHrpA,453840,456400,buttons and screens to give the pilot
PkujpWzHrpA,456400,459039,information about where to go and how
PkujpWzHrpA,459039,462400,the airplane is flying
PkujpWzHrpA,462479,464879,all right let's get those big jet
PkujpWzHrpA,464879,468400,engines going and get ready for takeoff
PkujpWzHrpA,468400,472000,give it some throttle lizzy
PkujpWzHrpA,473360,477520,these are powerful turbofan jet engines
PkujpWzHrpA,477520,480910,let's learn how they work
PkujpWzHrpA,480910,482879,[Music]
PkujpWzHrpA,482879,485759,these engines use a series of fans to
PkujpWzHrpA,485759,488560,squeeze the air smaller and smaller
PkujpWzHrpA,488560,490800,then they add jet fuel to the squeezed
PkujpWzHrpA,490800,493919,air and exploded shooting the hot air
PkujpWzHrpA,493919,496560,out the back and pushing the airplane
PkujpWzHrpA,496560,498030,forward
PkujpWzHrpA,498030,501039,[Music]
PkujpWzHrpA,501039,503120,the big parts at the back of the wing
PkujpWzHrpA,503120,505360,are called flaps
PkujpWzHrpA,505360,507919,when the flaps move down they create
PkujpWzHrpA,507919,510720,extra lift by squeezing the air under
PkujpWzHrpA,510720,513518,the wings as the airplane moves forward
PkujpWzHrpA,513518,516000,quickly through the sky
PkujpWzHrpA,516000,518399,this squeezing of the air pushes the
PkujpWzHrpA,518399,520880,airplane up
PkujpWzHrpA,520880,524159,the flaps also create drag which slows
PkujpWzHrpA,524159,526720,the airplane down
PkujpWzHrpA,526720,528640,these parts at the front of the wings
PkujpWzHrpA,528640,530800,are called slats
PkujpWzHrpA,530800,533200,they're used to create even more lift
PkujpWzHrpA,533200,536800,which pushes the airplane up in the air
PkujpWzHrpA,536800,539760,okay lizzy give it full throttle
PkujpWzHrpA,539760,543399,time for takeoff
PkujpWzHrpA,565680,566880,all right
PkujpWzHrpA,566880,569200,now that we're high up in the sky we can
PkujpWzHrpA,569200,571680,retract the landing gear so the airplane
PkujpWzHrpA,571680,574640,can go even faster
PkujpWzHrpA,574640,577120,we don't need as much lift so we can now
PkujpWzHrpA,577120,580240,close the slats
PkujpWzHrpA,580240,583519,and raise the flaps
PkujpWzHrpA,583680,585680,now let's learn about all the moving
PkujpWzHrpA,585680,587920,parts that captain lizzie can use to
PkujpWzHrpA,587920,591200,steer the airplane through the sky
PkujpWzHrpA,591200,593600,[Music]
PkujpWzHrpA,593600,595360,if captain lizzie wants to turn the
PkujpWzHrpA,595360,598080,airplane left or right she'll use this
PkujpWzHrpA,598080,600320,part called the rudder
PkujpWzHrpA,600320,602000,it works just like a rudder on a
PkujpWzHrpA,602000,603760,sailboat
PkujpWzHrpA,603760,605920,when the rudder moves to the left
PkujpWzHrpA,605920,609680,the airplane turns to the left
PkujpWzHrpA,609680,611839,when the rudder turns to the right the
PkujpWzHrpA,611839,616040,airplane turns to the right
PkujpWzHrpA,620560,623519,oh no look we're heading right for that
PkujpWzHrpA,623519,626160,big mountain we need to get higher in
PkujpWzHrpA,626160,627760,the sky
PkujpWzHrpA,627760,630880,to pitch the airplane up or down we'll
PkujpWzHrpA,630880,633040,use these parts at the back of the plane
PkujpWzHrpA,633040,635200,called the elevators
PkujpWzHrpA,635200,637360,when the elevators move up
PkujpWzHrpA,637360,640320,the nose of the airplane moves up
PkujpWzHrpA,640320,642480,hurry lizzy we're getting really close
PkujpWzHrpA,642480,645880,to that mountain
PkujpWzHrpA,647680,651920,whew that was a close one
PkujpWzHrpA,655040,657120,hey what's that hot air balloon doing
PkujpWzHrpA,657120,659839,way up here we better make a quick turn
PkujpWzHrpA,659839,662880,to get around it
PkujpWzHrpA,663519,665519,if we want to roll the plane for an even
PkujpWzHrpA,665519,668320,faster turn we'll use these small parts
PkujpWzHrpA,668320,670160,at the ends of the wings
PkujpWzHrpA,670160,673279,these parts are called ailerons
PkujpWzHrpA,673279,676079,when one aileron goes up the other one
PkujpWzHrpA,676079,677279,goes down
PkujpWzHrpA,677279,681560,causing the airplane to roll
PkujpWzHrpA,691519,694320,okay captain lizzy our flight is almost
PkujpWzHrpA,694320,695200,done
PkujpWzHrpA,695200,698560,time to bring it in for a landing
PkujpWzHrpA,698560,700640,when captain lizzie wants to slow the
PkujpWzHrpA,700640,703279,airplane down before landing she'll use
PkujpWzHrpA,703279,705040,these parts on the top of the wings
PkujpWzHrpA,705040,706880,called spoilers
PkujpWzHrpA,706880,709200,when the spoilers are used along with
PkujpWzHrpA,709200,711920,the slats and the flaps this will slow
PkujpWzHrpA,711920,714240,the airplane down for a nice smooth
PkujpWzHrpA,714240,717240,landing
PkujpWzHrpA,717519,720560,nice landing lizzy
PkujpWzHrpA,720560,723760,great job brainiacs now you know a lot
PkujpWzHrpA,723760,727440,about airplanes and how they work
PkujpWzHrpA,727440,730959,aren't airplanes cool learning how
PkujpWzHrpA,730959,733800,things work is so much fun
PkujpWzHrpA,733800,735120,[Music]
PkujpWzHrpA,735120,739040,what do you want to learn about next
PkujpWzHrpA,743040,745920,hey brainiacs check out this big
PkujpWzHrpA,745920,747839,construction site
PkujpWzHrpA,747839,750480,wow look at all the awesome construction
PkujpWzHrpA,750480,752720,vehicles
PkujpWzHrpA,752720,755440,do you know what an excavator is
PkujpWzHrpA,755440,756839,they're so
PkujpWzHrpA,756839,759040,cool they use something called
PkujpWzHrpA,759040,762320,hydraulics which makes them super strong
PkujpWzHrpA,762320,765760,and really good at digging holes
PkujpWzHrpA,765760,768000,let's put this excavator together from
PkujpWzHrpA,768000,770320,all the different parts so we can learn
PkujpWzHrpA,770320,772720,how it works
PkujpWzHrpA,772720,774720,first we have this big part called the
PkujpWzHrpA,774720,775839,chassis
PkujpWzHrpA,775839,778560,which holds the bottom parts together
PkujpWzHrpA,778560,781600,now let's add the final drive wheels
PkujpWzHrpA,781600,783680,the final drive wheels have bumpy
PkujpWzHrpA,783680,786320,sprockets which will be used to move the
PkujpWzHrpA,786320,787760,tracks
PkujpWzHrpA,787760,789680,at the other end of the chassis we'll
PkujpWzHrpA,789680,792320,find the front idler wheels
PkujpWzHrpA,792320,794399,these wheels help the track roll around
PkujpWzHrpA,794399,797600,the front of the chassis
PkujpWzHrpA,797600,800880,now we'll add the tracks to the chassis
PkujpWzHrpA,800880,803200,these tracks give the excavator lots of
PkujpWzHrpA,803200,805360,grip so that it can drive over bumpy
PkujpWzHrpA,805360,807680,ground and mud
PkujpWzHrpA,807680,810160,then we'll need some rollers at the top
PkujpWzHrpA,810160,812839,and at the bottom for the track to roll
PkujpWzHrpA,812839,816720,along on top of the chassis is the swing
PkujpWzHrpA,816720,818079,drive
PkujpWzHrpA,818079,820320,the swing drive allows the excavator to
PkujpWzHrpA,820320,822959,spin around quickly
PkujpWzHrpA,822959,825839,this big part is called the house
PkujpWzHrpA,825839,828240,the house holds the engine and connects
PkujpWzHrpA,828240,831040,all of the upper parts together
PkujpWzHrpA,831040,833440,on the back of the house there's a big
PkujpWzHrpA,833440,836399,heavy piece called a counterweight
PkujpWzHrpA,836399,838880,this helps keep the excavator balanced
PkujpWzHrpA,838880,840800,when it's digging with its big arm at
PkujpWzHrpA,840800,842880,the front
PkujpWzHrpA,842880,845199,now we'll add the engine
PkujpWzHrpA,845199,847360,that's the part that provides power to
PkujpWzHrpA,847360,851199,the excavator and makes everything move
PkujpWzHrpA,851199,853760,let's add a seat so the operator has
PkujpWzHrpA,853760,855440,somewhere to sit
PkujpWzHrpA,855440,858320,on either side of the seat there are two
PkujpWzHrpA,858320,860000,joysticks
PkujpWzHrpA,860000,862639,the operator uses these joysticks to
PkujpWzHrpA,862639,866079,control the big arm of the excavator
PkujpWzHrpA,866079,868639,this part is called the cab
PkujpWzHrpA,868639,870959,it keeps the operator safe at the
PkujpWzHrpA,870959,873839,dangerous construction site
PkujpWzHrpA,873839,876160,now it's time to assemble the big arm of
PkujpWzHrpA,876160,878560,the excavator
PkujpWzHrpA,878560,884040,this big strong part is called the boom
PkujpWzHrpA,884560,887360,beneath the boom we'll add the hydraulic
PkujpWzHrpA,887360,889600,boom cylinders
PkujpWzHrpA,889600,891839,these parts can move the boom up and
PkujpWzHrpA,891839,895120,down with amazing strength
PkujpWzHrpA,895120,897360,the next part of the big arm is called
PkujpWzHrpA,897360,899040,the stick
PkujpWzHrpA,899040,901360,now we need to add the hydraulic stick
PkujpWzHrpA,901360,903040,cylinder
PkujpWzHrpA,903040,905279,this will push the end of the stick in
PkujpWzHrpA,905279,906840,or out
PkujpWzHrpA,906840,908320,[Music]
PkujpWzHrpA,908320,910560,the stick cylinder needs to be connected
PkujpWzHrpA,910560,913120,with hydraulic hoses
PkujpWzHrpA,913120,915120,one hydraulic hose goes to the front of
PkujpWzHrpA,915120,918560,the cylinder and one goes to the back
PkujpWzHrpA,918560,921680,we'll see why this is important later
PkujpWzHrpA,921680,923680,at the end of the stick we have the
PkujpWzHrpA,923680,924720,bucket
PkujpWzHrpA,924720,926399,the bucket is the part that helps the
PkujpWzHrpA,926399,929440,excavator dig deep holes and lift lots
PkujpWzHrpA,929440,931440,of rocks and dirt
PkujpWzHrpA,931440,933600,the pointy teeth at the end help the
PkujpWzHrpA,933600,936639,bucket cut into the hard ground
PkujpWzHrpA,936639,939279,this part is called the h-link because
PkujpWzHrpA,939279,943600,it's shaped like a capital letter h
PkujpWzHrpA,944560,948720,these parts are called dog bones
PkujpWzHrpA,948720,951279,don't get too excited lizzy they're just
PkujpWzHrpA,951279,953600,shaped like dog bones but you wouldn't
PkujpWzHrpA,953600,955519,want to chew on these
PkujpWzHrpA,955519,957519,the dog bones are used to connect the
PkujpWzHrpA,957519,959920,h-link to the stick
PkujpWzHrpA,959920,962399,finally we'll add the hydraulic bucket
PkujpWzHrpA,962399,965839,cylinder to connect to the h-link along
PkujpWzHrpA,965839,968399,with more hydraulic hoses so we can
PkujpWzHrpA,968399,970720,control the bucket
PkujpWzHrpA,970720,971839,awesome
PkujpWzHrpA,971839,974399,our big powerful excavator is now
PkujpWzHrpA,974399,975839,complete
PkujpWzHrpA,975839,977759,do you want to know the secret to why
PkujpWzHrpA,977759,980399,excavators are so strong
PkujpWzHrpA,980399,982959,it's something called hydraulics
PkujpWzHrpA,982959,986399,let's learn how it works
PkujpWzHrpA,986560,989440,inside the excavator there is a pump
PkujpWzHrpA,989440,992320,that pushes hydraulic fluid like engine
PkujpWzHrpA,992320,997839,oil really quickly through small tubes
PkujpWzHrpA,997839,1000000,the fluid then goes into one end of a
PkujpWzHrpA,1000000,1002480,hydraulic cylinder here
PkujpWzHrpA,1002480,1004990,or here
PkujpWzHrpA,1004990,1006880,[Music]
PkujpWzHrpA,1006880,1009680,inside the cylinder there is a piston
PkujpWzHrpA,1009680,1011920,which separates the fluid coming in from
PkujpWzHrpA,1011920,1014320,each end of the cylinder
PkujpWzHrpA,1014320,1016480,if you want the piston to come in
PkujpWzHrpA,1016480,1019199,you pump the fluid shown in red into
PkujpWzHrpA,1019199,1021360,this end
PkujpWzHrpA,1021360,1023600,if you want the piston to go out you
PkujpWzHrpA,1023600,1026400,pump the fluid shown in blue into the
PkujpWzHrpA,1026400,1028000,other end
PkujpWzHrpA,1028000,1030319,when the high speed fluid from the tubes
PkujpWzHrpA,1030319,1033120,moves into the much wider cylinder it
PkujpWzHrpA,1033120,1035678,slows down but it pushes against the
PkujpWzHrpA,1035678,1038640,piston with much greater force
PkujpWzHrpA,1038640,1040798,so by controlling the fluid going into
PkujpWzHrpA,1040798,1043600,each end of all the cylinders you get a
PkujpWzHrpA,1043600,1046640,super strong excavator arm
PkujpWzHrpA,1046640,1049039,pretty cool huh
PkujpWzHrpA,1049039,1050400,hey lizzy
PkujpWzHrpA,1050400,1052720,do you want to hop inside the excavator
PkujpWzHrpA,1052720,1055039,and show us how it works
PkujpWzHrpA,1055039,1058000,okay let's join lizzy in the cab and see
PkujpWzHrpA,1058000,1062559,how she controls all the different parts
PkujpWzHrpA,1063440,1065919,before we get started we have to unlock
PkujpWzHrpA,1065919,1068880,the safety lock lever so lizzy can use
PkujpWzHrpA,1068880,1071200,the controls
PkujpWzHrpA,1071200,1073600,these handles are used to drive each
PkujpWzHrpA,1073600,1075280,track
PkujpWzHrpA,1075280,1077919,to move forward lizzy will push both of
PkujpWzHrpA,1077919,1081440,the handles forward to move backwards
PkujpWzHrpA,1081440,1085200,lizzy will pull the handles back
PkujpWzHrpA,1086160,1088960,to turn the whole excavator we can make
PkujpWzHrpA,1088960,1091760,one track go backwards and one track go
PkujpWzHrpA,1091760,1095640,forward like this
PkujpWzHrpA,1096240,1098000,but we don't always have to use the
PkujpWzHrpA,1098000,1099810,tracks to turn the excavator
PkujpWzHrpA,1099810,1101280,[Music]
PkujpWzHrpA,1101280,1103840,we can also swing just the house by
PkujpWzHrpA,1103840,1106160,pushing the left joystick to the sides
PkujpWzHrpA,1106160,1109480,like this
PkujpWzHrpA,1112160,1114480,now for the really fun part
PkujpWzHrpA,1114480,1116960,we can use the other joystick movements
PkujpWzHrpA,1116960,1119840,to control the big powerful excavator
PkujpWzHrpA,1119840,1121120,arm
PkujpWzHrpA,1121120,1123039,to move the boom up
PkujpWzHrpA,1123039,1126240,we'll pull the right joystick backward
PkujpWzHrpA,1126240,1128160,to lower the boom we'll push the
PkujpWzHrpA,1128160,1130720,joystick forward
PkujpWzHrpA,1130720,1133440,to extend the stick we'll push the left
PkujpWzHrpA,1133440,1136720,joystick forward like this to retract
PkujpWzHrpA,1136720,1139120,this stick we'll pull the left joystick
PkujpWzHrpA,1139120,1140720,backward
PkujpWzHrpA,1140720,1143600,finally to dump the bucket we'll push
PkujpWzHrpA,1143600,1146240,the right joystick to the right
PkujpWzHrpA,1146240,1148240,to curl the bucket in
PkujpWzHrpA,1148240,1150160,we'll push the right joystick to the
PkujpWzHrpA,1150160,1151679,left
PkujpWzHrpA,1151679,1152880,awesome
PkujpWzHrpA,1152880,1154960,now we know the main controls of the
PkujpWzHrpA,1154960,1157760,excavator
PkujpWzHrpA,1158400,1159840,all right
PkujpWzHrpA,1159840,1161600,let's use our new skills to take out
PkujpWzHrpA,1161600,1163919,those heavy rocks from the hole in the
PkujpWzHrpA,1163919,1165370,construction site
PkujpWzHrpA,1165370,1168470,[Applause]
PkujpWzHrpA,1173840,1174720,whoa
PkujpWzHrpA,1174720,1176799,it's so powerful
PkujpWzHrpA,1176799,1178960,it has no problem picking up all those
PkujpWzHrpA,1178960,1180640,heavy rocks
PkujpWzHrpA,1180640,1182880,hey here comes the dump truck to take
PkujpWzHrpA,1182880,1184880,away the rocks
PkujpWzHrpA,1184880,1189480,let's dump them into the dump box
PkujpWzHrpA,1197440,1200160,nice work lizzy
PkujpWzHrpA,1200160,1204039,let's get another load
PkujpWzHrpA,1227600,1229840,great job
PkujpWzHrpA,1229840,1231600,now the dump truck can take all those
PkujpWzHrpA,1231600,1235000,rocks away
PkujpWzHrpA,1236280,1238880,[Applause]
PkujpWzHrpA,1238880,1242000,thanks truck driver
PkujpWzHrpA,1242559,1244640,wow that was a fun day at the
PkujpWzHrpA,1244640,1246960,construction site
PkujpWzHrpA,1246960,1249919,we learned so much about excavators and
PkujpWzHrpA,1249919,1251679,hydraulics
PkujpWzHrpA,1251679,1255120,what do you want to learn about next
PkujpWzHrpA,1255120,1257440,stay tuned we'll be back after these
PkujpWzHrpA,1257440,1260440,messages
PkujpWzHrpA,1262159,1264880,in our previous episode we learned all
PkujpWzHrpA,1264880,1267600,about the planets in our solar system
PkujpWzHrpA,1267600,1269760,but do you know how far away they are
PkujpWzHrpA,1269760,1271200,from us
PkujpWzHrpA,1271200,1273679,it's easy for us to imagine medium-sized
PkujpWzHrpA,1273679,1277120,distances and things like buildings city
PkujpWzHrpA,1277120,1280799,blocks and even entire cities
PkujpWzHrpA,1280799,1284000,but when someone says that pluto is 7.3
PkujpWzHrpA,1284000,1286320,billion kilometers away
PkujpWzHrpA,1286320,1288799,what does that really look like
PkujpWzHrpA,1288799,1290640,for an easier way to picture how
PkujpWzHrpA,1290640,1293679,gigantic our solar system is
PkujpWzHrpA,1293679,1295919,let's build a scale model of our solar
PkujpWzHrpA,1295919,1298559,system in a city and see how far away
PkujpWzHrpA,1298559,1302840,the planets really are
PkujpWzHrpA,1308159,1310400,we'll start in an american football
PkujpWzHrpA,1310400,1313280,field with the sun placed at the 50-yard
PkujpWzHrpA,1313280,1316480,line and shrunk down to the size of a 44
PkujpWzHrpA,1316480,1318640,centimeter beach ball
PkujpWzHrpA,1318640,1321280,at this scale earth and venus are the
PkujpWzHrpA,1321280,1324480,size of a small stud earring only four
PkujpWzHrpA,1324480,1327039,millimeters in diameter
PkujpWzHrpA,1327039,1329120,jupiter is around the size of a golf
PkujpWzHrpA,1329120,1330480,ball
PkujpWzHrpA,1330480,1332480,uranus and neptune are the size of a
PkujpWzHrpA,1332480,1334080,small marble
PkujpWzHrpA,1334080,1336640,and our moon and pluto are closer to the
PkujpWzHrpA,1336640,1339280,size of a round candy sprinkle
PkujpWzHrpA,1339280,1342159,only one millimeter wide
PkujpWzHrpA,1342159,1343840,now let's move them to their proper
PkujpWzHrpA,1343840,1346480,place based on their farthest distances
PkujpWzHrpA,1346480,1349120,from the sun
PkujpWzHrpA,1349760,1353039,we'll find mercury near the 26 yard line
PkujpWzHrpA,1353039,1356000,or 22 meters from the sun
PkujpWzHrpA,1356000,1358640,that's equal to nearly 70 million
PkujpWzHrpA,1358640,1361600,kilometers at actual scale
PkujpWzHrpA,1361600,1364480,venus will be near the 12 yard line
PkujpWzHrpA,1364480,1367200,34 meters from the sun
PkujpWzHrpA,1367200,1369919,earth can be found inside the end zone
PkujpWzHrpA,1369919,1373280,at 48 meters from our beach ball sun
PkujpWzHrpA,1373280,1376000,and our little candy sprinkle sized moon
PkujpWzHrpA,1376000,1378159,is around 13 centimeters from the
PkujpWzHrpA,1378159,1381360,earring sized earth
PkujpWzHrpA,1381500,1383440,[Music]
PkujpWzHrpA,1383440,1386159,to find mars we'll have to get up to the
PkujpWzHrpA,1386159,1388559,middle of the lower seating section
PkujpWzHrpA,1388559,1391760,around 80 meters from the sun
PkujpWzHrpA,1391760,1394159,at this scale mars is only two
PkujpWzHrpA,1394159,1396799,millimeters in diameter as you can see
PkujpWzHrpA,1396799,1399210,compared to this bottle cap
PkujpWzHrpA,1399210,1403360,[Music]
PkujpWzHrpA,1403360,1406159,after mars the planets are much farther
PkujpWzHrpA,1406159,1408559,apart
PkujpWzHrpA,1408640,1411240,to get to jupiter we'll have to head out
PkujpWzHrpA,1411240,1416080,260 meters or 850 feet which is halfway
PkujpWzHrpA,1416080,1419279,into the parking lot
PkujpWzHrpA,1422480,1424559,saturn will take us all the way through
PkujpWzHrpA,1424559,1426720,the parking lot and to the edge of the
PkujpWzHrpA,1426720,1430320,first block of the city or 480m meters
PkujpWzHrpA,1430320,1433039,from the sun
PkujpWzHrpA,1433350,1436080,[Music]
PkujpWzHrpA,1436080,1438960,uranus is over five city blocks past the
PkujpWzHrpA,1438960,1440559,parking lot
PkujpWzHrpA,1440559,1443440,that's 950 meters from the center of the
PkujpWzHrpA,1443440,1445240,stadium
PkujpWzHrpA,1445240,1448400,[Music]
PkujpWzHrpA,1448400,1451440,our small marble-sized neptune takes us
PkujpWzHrpA,1451440,1453919,right to the edge of our model city
PkujpWzHrpA,1453919,1456480,almost 10 blocks from the parking lot
