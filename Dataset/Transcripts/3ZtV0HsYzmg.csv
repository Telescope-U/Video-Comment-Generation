3ZtV0HsYzmg,22080,24400,critical of the uk for its attitude
3ZtV0HsYzmg,24400,27359,towards president putin and his policies
3ZtV0HsYzmg,27359,28880,he told our russia editor steve

3ZtV0HsYzmg,31760,34800,between russia and the uk as bad would

3ZtV0HsYzmg,56480,59199,we declared a special military operation
3ZtV0HsYzmg,59199,61760,because we had absolutely no other way
3ZtV0HsYzmg,61760,64239,of explaining to the west that dragging
3ZtV0HsYzmg,64239,68798,ukraine into nato was a criminal act
3ZtV0HsYzmg,70560,73360,russia's special operation has resulted
3ZtV0HsYzmg,73360,75520,in thousands of civilian deaths in
3ZtV0HsYzmg,75520,77759,ukraine
3ZtV0HsYzmg,77759,79920,moscow claims it's protecting russian
3ZtV0HsYzmg,79920,84080,speakers and fighting nazis
3ZtV0HsYzmg,90079,92320,about a ukrainian village where russian
3ZtV0HsYzmg,92320,94640,soldiers had forced hundreds of people
3ZtV0HsYzmg,94640,97360,including 74 children to spend a month
3ZtV0HsYzmg,97360,101200,in a basement with no toilet
3ZtV0HsYzmg,112479,114799,it's a great pity but international

3ZtV0HsYzmg,117040,119200,commissioner for human rights the un
3ZtV0HsYzmg,119200,121040,secretary general and other un
3ZtV0HsYzmg,121040,123360,representatives are being put under
3ZtV0HsYzmg,123360,125119,pressure by the west
3ZtV0HsYzmg,125119,126799,and very often they're being used to
3ZtV0HsYzmg,126799,131280,amplify fake news spread by the west
3ZtV0HsYzmg,131520,135280,so you're saying that russia is squeaky
3ZtV0HsYzmg,137599,139680,russia is not squeaky
3ZtV0HsYzmg,139680,142160,russia is what it is and we are not
3ZtV0HsYzmg,142160,145520,ashamed of showing who we are
3ZtV0HsYzmg,145520,147680,and one of the two british men sentenced
3ZtV0HsYzmg,147680,150560,to death by a russian proxy court in
3ZtV0HsYzmg,150560,152800,rebel-held eastern ukraine
3ZtV0HsYzmg,152800,155200,aiden aslan and sean pinner had been
3ZtV0HsYzmg,155200,157120,fighting for ukraine
3ZtV0HsYzmg,157120,159280,i tell mr lavrov that in the eyes of the
3ZtV0HsYzmg,159280,161680,west russia is responsible for their
3ZtV0HsYzmg,161680,163920,fate
3ZtV0HsYzmg,166879,168720,i am not interested in the eyes of the
3ZtV0HsYzmg,168720,171280,west at all i'm only interested in
3ZtV0HsYzmg,171280,172800,international law
3ZtV0HsYzmg,172800,174640,according to international law
3ZtV0HsYzmg,174640,176800,mercenaries are not recognized as
3ZtV0HsYzmg,176800,178159,combatants
3ZtV0HsYzmg,178159,179760,but they're not mercenaries they served
3ZtV0HsYzmg,179760,182080,in the ukrainian army
3ZtV0HsYzmg,182080,183920,this should be decided by a court you
3ZtV0HsYzmg,183920,187040,think the court's independent
3ZtV0HsYzmg,187040,188640,i'm convinced there are independent
3ZtV0HsYzmg,188640,190640,courts there
3ZtV0HsYzmg,190640,194560,do you think your courts are independent
3ZtV0HsYzmg,194560,196879,and on uk russian relations no
3ZtV0HsYzmg,196879,199599,expectation
3ZtV0HsYzmg,202319,203760,i don't think there's even any room for
3ZtV0HsYzmg,203760,206000,maneuver anymore because both boris
3ZtV0HsYzmg,206000,208720,johnson and liz trust say openly that we
3ZtV0HsYzmg,208720,210720,should defeat russia we should force
3ZtV0HsYzmg,210720,215280,russia to its knees go on then do it
3ZtV0HsYzmg,219599,221920,basically what sergey lavrov is saying
3ZtV0HsYzmg,221920,224480,there to britain and to the west is
3ZtV0HsYzmg,224480,227040,bring it on nearly four months after the
3ZtV0HsYzmg,227040,228480,invasion the russian authorities are
3ZtV0HsYzmg,228480,230879,defiant they are determined and they are
3ZtV0HsYzmg,230879,233519,dismissive of their critics but in that
3ZtV0HsYzmg,233519,235360,interview i didn't get all the answers
3ZtV0HsYzmg,235360,237280,to all of my questions for example i
3ZtV0HsYzmg,237280,240720,asked mr lavrov would he say would he
3ZtV0HsYzmg,240720,242480,confirm that there will be no more
3ZtV0HsYzmg,242480,244640,special military operations or russian
3ZtV0HsYzmg,244640,247760,invasions of countries close by
3ZtV0HsYzmg,247760,250799,he dodged that one
