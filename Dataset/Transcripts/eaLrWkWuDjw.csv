eaLrWkWuDjw,6170,9360,hey it's me so I feel like I've been
eaLrWkWuDjw,9360,11969,talking about trends a lot on my channel
eaLrWkWuDjw,11969,14790,trending recently and how terrible I am
eaLrWkWuDjw,14790,17250,at keeping up with them hard to keep up
eaLrWkWuDjw,17250,18990,with the trends maybe hadn't noticed
eaLrWkWuDjw,18990,20609,maybe you don't care these earrings are
eaLrWkWuDjw,20609,23220,a lot too much maybe anyway there have
eaLrWkWuDjw,23220,25500,been so many things trending in the art
eaLrWkWuDjw,25500,27599,world of YouTube in the last year or so
eaLrWkWuDjw,27599,30810,I have basically missed oh pretty much
eaLrWkWuDjw,30810,32610,all of them I don't know I'm in my own
eaLrWkWuDjw,32610,34770,little world I noticed them I see them I
eaLrWkWuDjw,34770,37320,just don't do it until they're dead and
eaLrWkWuDjw,37320,40260,then I'm like I guess it's time to do
eaLrWkWuDjw,40260,42510,that thing but I have a whole list of
eaLrWkWuDjw,42510,45210,art trends that have gone by that I just
eaLrWkWuDjw,45210,47730,have not experienced I just want to try
eaLrWkWuDjw,47730,49890,them out even though it's a little late
eaLrWkWuDjw,49890,50430,now
eaLrWkWuDjw,50430,52199,I'm assuming that they were trending for
eaLrWkWuDjw,52199,54300,a reason so I need to see what that's
eaLrWkWuDjw,54300,56610,about I don't know what this is gonna be
eaLrWkWuDjw,56610,58649,is this gonna be a 2 part 3 part series
eaLrWkWuDjw,58649,60449,I don't know we're just gonna kind of
eaLrWkWuDjw,60449,61350,play this by ear
eaLrWkWuDjw,61350,64170,wing it I was trying to think of more
eaLrWkWuDjw,64170,65970,expressions that include body parts but
eaLrWkWuDjw,65970,68100,I can't belly button it okay the first
eaLrWkWuDjw,68100,70439,thing on my list that I've been waiting
eaLrWkWuDjw,70439,74570,to try is hydro dipping
eaLrWkWuDjw,74750,79979,that's my hydro dip dance this is
eaLrWkWuDjw,79979,81210,probably the last time I'm gonna do it
eaLrWkWuDjw,81210,83729,so don't worry maybe I understand the
eaLrWkWuDjw,83729,85890,basic process of how to hydro dip but
eaLrWkWuDjw,85890,87659,I've never tried it myself we're just
eaLrWkWuDjw,87659,90270,gonna be kind of trying things and going
eaLrWkWuDjw,90270,93570,along and doing it learning as we go if
eaLrWkWuDjw,93570,95040,you don't know what hydro dipping is
eaLrWkWuDjw,95040,96900,wonderful we're gonna learn together
eaLrWkWuDjw,96900,100140,okay I believe I purchased all the
eaLrWkWuDjw,100140,101990,materials that I'm gonna need for this
eaLrWkWuDjw,101990,105570,boom I got spray paint out the wazoo
eaLrWkWuDjw,105570,108390,because I need every single color
eaLrWkWuDjw,108390,114060,why because I love them all I got a
eaLrWkWuDjw,114060,117119,couple things to try to hydro dip and I
eaLrWkWuDjw,117119,120320,got a big tub
eaLrWkWuDjw,122310,125050,you are supposed to fill this up with
eaLrWkWuDjw,125050,127570,water hydro you take spray paint you
eaLrWkWuDjw,127570,129729,spray it in the water and then you dip I
eaLrWkWuDjw,129729,132310,have no idea how big of a mess this is
eaLrWkWuDjw,132310,133480,gonna make I really don't feel like
eaLrWkWuDjw,133480,135130,going outside because it's disgusting
eaLrWkWuDjw,135130,137770,outside right now it's cold I just don't
eaLrWkWuDjw,137770,140110,want to is this a bad idea to do it
eaLrWkWuDjw,140110,144880,inside should have gotten a tarp hello
eaLrWkWuDjw,144880,148030,do you have a tarp what color is it
eaLrWkWuDjw,148030,150490,mmm okay okay thank you all all right
eaLrWkWuDjw,150490,154989,bye we have a tarp canvas also I did
eaLrWkWuDjw,154989,159489,this what am i doing I don't know we
eaLrWkWuDjw,159489,161140,have a workspace set up we have
eaLrWkWuDjw,161140,164360,protection it's time to fill her up
eaLrWkWuDjw,164360,173879,[Music]
eaLrWkWuDjw,177460,181429,[Music]
eaLrWkWuDjw,182770,189349,no no wait a second I can't pick this up
eaLrWkWuDjw,189349,191420,I guess this is why you're supposed to
eaLrWkWuDjw,191420,192830,do it outside then you can just fill it
eaLrWkWuDjw,192830,195560,up with a hose hmm
eaLrWkWuDjw,195560,196730,there are multiple ways that this
eaLrWkWuDjw,196730,198200,situation could have been avoided I
eaLrWkWuDjw,198200,199730,could have brought the water to the bin
eaLrWkWuDjw,199730,202069,using a magical thing called a bucket or
eaLrWkWuDjw,202069,203569,I could have just filled this up with
eaLrWkWuDjw,203569,205610,half of that water and been totally fine
eaLrWkWuDjw,205610,209030,this is clear to me no I can't do you
eaLrWkWuDjw,209030,213980,like to help me oh that was heavy
eaLrWkWuDjw,213980,216170,good thing I did that all by myself no
eaLrWkWuDjw,216170,220190,help whatsoever strength and stuff got
eaLrWkWuDjw,220190,224480,my table of water it's quite warm it's
eaLrWkWuDjw,224480,226370,actually very soothing kind of lovely
eaLrWkWuDjw,226370,230680,I think the sweater needs to come off
eaLrWkWuDjw,230680,233239,I'm gonna open all the windows in the
eaLrWkWuDjw,233239,243470,area for proper ventilation it's
eaLrWkWuDjw,243470,245390,seriously been like three hours since I
eaLrWkWuDjw,245390,247640,started filming this video it's time to
eaLrWkWuDjw,247640,249650,actually do something so I got these
eaLrWkWuDjw,249650,251180,little containers from Target or like
eaLrWkWuDjw,251180,253519,little plastic organizers I guess says
eaLrWkWuDjw,253519,258799,bonds to plastic plastic okay open these
eaLrWkWuDjw,258799,263990,up I've got one ready just gonna dip it
eaLrWkWuDjw,263990,265760,like that what color should we choose
eaLrWkWuDjw,265760,269360,for our first hydro dip ever teal yellow
eaLrWkWuDjw,269360,273590,orange no green no purple these are the
eaLrWkWuDjw,273590,279380,ones did I already shake this one oh my
eaLrWkWuDjw,279380,281030,gosh I'm scared what if I get spray
eaLrWkWuDjw,281030,282800,paint all over everything in this room I
eaLrWkWuDjw,282800,284120,should have just done this outside
eaLrWkWuDjw,284120,287180,honestly is that ruined ready we're
eaLrWkWuDjw,287180,290560,gonna spray in the water
eaLrWkWuDjw,295780,302979,yep this is a quite messy oh gosh I
eaLrWkWuDjw,302979,307780,think I might be spraying too close okay
eaLrWkWuDjw,307810,310250,[Music]
eaLrWkWuDjw,310250,314410,all right oh oh I need gloves gloves and
eaLrWkWuDjw,314410,318340,[Music]
eaLrWkWuDjw,318340,322510,oh I got it all on my arm let me go
eaLrWkWuDjw,322510,324940,attempt to scrub my arm so that's not
eaLrWkWuDjw,324940,328780,coming off at all this is what I've made
eaLrWkWuDjw,328780,331590,it's honestly kind of ugly very lumpy
eaLrWkWuDjw,331590,334660,but there's that this is not as easy as
eaLrWkWuDjw,334660,335530,it looks
eaLrWkWuDjw,335530,339610,we have to keep going I'm gonna try
eaLrWkWuDjw,339610,345010,another color set hey and I'm gonna wear
eaLrWkWuDjw,345010,347290,a mask this time cuz the fumes are real
eaLrWkWuDjw,347290,349420,strong it's not cute but neither is
eaLrWkWuDjw,349420,354600,getting poisoned by toxins oh here we go
eaLrWkWuDjw,355430,358990,[Music]
eaLrWkWuDjw,368300,370550,[Music]
eaLrWkWuDjw,370550,373319,this is the second one and it's so much
eaLrWkWuDjw,373319,376379,worse so lumpy and globby it honestly
eaLrWkWuDjw,376379,378449,looks sidious every time I've seen
eaLrWkWuDjw,378449,380460,people do this it just turns out so
eaLrWkWuDjw,380460,382139,smooth and beautiful what am I doing
eaLrWkWuDjw,382139,384119,wrong here could it be the temperature
eaLrWkWuDjw,384119,386550,of the water it's quite warm I'm gonna
eaLrWkWuDjw,386550,389729,have to do some quick research I just
eaLrWkWuDjw,389729,391409,watched a video they did nothing
eaLrWkWuDjw,391409,393259,differently than I'm doing and also
eaLrWkWuDjw,393259,395999,apparently warm water is supposed to be
eaLrWkWuDjw,395999,400080,best for hydro dipping so um maybe it
eaLrWkWuDjw,400080,401759,just takes practice let's just keep on
eaLrWkWuDjw,401759,409889,trying it really here we go hi I was
eaLrWkWuDjw,409889,411960,quite focused on the task at hand during
eaLrWkWuDjw,411960,414240,this whole thing also I had a mask on so
eaLrWkWuDjw,414240,417349,it was pretty hard for me to communicate
eaLrWkWuDjw,417349,421169,so I'm gonna be the voice for myself
eaLrWkWuDjw,421169,422939,I've gone for a very bright kind of
eaLrWkWuDjw,422939,425279,summery color scheme on this one and
eaLrWkWuDjw,425279,428249,going in for the dip I am making sure to
eaLrWkWuDjw,428249,430199,clear away the excess paint before
eaLrWkWuDjw,430199,432479,bringing it back up because I don't want
eaLrWkWuDjw,432479,434759,to double dip and ruin the design and it
eaLrWkWuDjw,434759,438479,looks like skin almost lost it I almost
eaLrWkWuDjw,438479,439229,lost it again
eaLrWkWuDjw,439229,441689,not sure that I absolutely love this one
eaLrWkWuDjw,441689,443430,I mean it's pretty messy in certain
eaLrWkWuDjw,443430,445830,spots but a little bit better than the
eaLrWkWuDjw,445830,449519,others moving on to the next attempt I'm
eaLrWkWuDjw,449519,451889,trying to have confidence at this point
eaLrWkWuDjw,451889,454019,I got this but I'm actually slightly
eaLrWkWuDjw,454019,456479,panicking I attempted a full rainbow of
eaLrWkWuDjw,456479,458309,colors for this one I don't know what I
eaLrWkWuDjw,458309,460349,was nodding about this is my only form
eaLrWkWuDjw,460349,462330,of communication I was definitely too
eaLrWkWuDjw,462330,464729,light on the paint with this one clearly
eaLrWkWuDjw,464729,467879,what are you doing there's so many empty
eaLrWkWuDjw,467879,469889,spots in that and I shouldn't have
eaLrWkWuDjw,469889,471629,dipped it at this point so I ended up
eaLrWkWuDjw,471629,475740,with another less than ideal result okay
eaLrWkWuDjw,475740,477899,well it doesn't look like the full
eaLrWkWuDjw,477899,480059,rainbow is on there normally I only see
eaLrWkWuDjw,480059,481769,people use like two or three colors
eaLrWkWuDjw,481769,484939,that's best but you know I can't resist
eaLrWkWuDjw,484939,488370,I'm gonna try a few more things I found
eaLrWkWuDjw,488370,491430,these coasters they say I wish I could
eaLrWkWuDjw,491430,494519,text my dog such a weird thing to put on
eaLrWkWuDjw,494519,496529,a coaster who thinks of that why a
eaLrWkWuDjw,496529,499139,person who designed this the person who
eaLrWkWuDjw,499139,501900,buys this the person who has
eaLrWkWuDjw,501900,504360,on their chin and doesn't know it the
eaLrWkWuDjw,504360,505800,reason I chose these though is because
eaLrWkWuDjw,505800,507870,they were the closest to plain white
eaLrWkWuDjw,507870,509699,that I could find I'm hoping that I can
eaLrWkWuDjw,509699,512190,cover up the text with a spray paint if
eaLrWkWuDjw,512190,514349,it's a problem then I will prime them I
eaLrWkWuDjw,514349,516450,really want a full rainbow hydro dip to
eaLrWkWuDjw,516450,518250,work out I'm just gonna keep going I
eaLrWkWuDjw,518250,520169,look like such a little bug with this
eaLrWkWuDjw,520169,521820,thing on let me take a moment to talk
eaLrWkWuDjw,521820,523860,about this process it was kind of
eaLrWkWuDjw,523860,525870,stressful doing something this messy
eaLrWkWuDjw,525870,528300,around all my arch and all my equipment
eaLrWkWuDjw,528300,531300,also it was so few me I feel like I can
eaLrWkWuDjw,531300,533490,smell the spray paint just watching this
eaLrWkWuDjw,533490,535529,oh it's so strong which of course would
eaLrWkWuDjw,535529,537660,have been a non-issue if I were outside
eaLrWkWuDjw,537660,539640,I don't mind filming little bits here
eaLrWkWuDjw,539640,541890,and there outside but I really didn't
eaLrWkWuDjw,541890,543900,want to film this entire video outside
eaLrWkWuDjw,543900,546210,because I just don't currently have a
eaLrWkWuDjw,546210,548520,good filming setup for outdoors without
eaLrWkWuDjw,548520,550290,needing somebody else to help me the
eaLrWkWuDjw,550290,552630,whole time plus it was really cold whoa
eaLrWkWuDjw,552630,558570,did I just say donut oh what's donut so
eaLrWkWuDjw,558570,560640,that one actually would have been pretty
eaLrWkWuDjw,560640,562890,cool I guess what you can totally see
eaLrWkWuDjw,562890,564480,the letters through it and I hate that
eaLrWkWuDjw,564480,570380,boom so let me go prime these real quick
eaLrWkWuDjw,574170,578170,it'll do it my face we have to wait for
eaLrWkWuDjw,578170,580360,those to dry so let's keep going
eaLrWkWuDjw,580360,582490,what can we do next how about a paint
eaLrWkWuDjw,582490,588520,palette okay so this one I'm doing now
eaLrWkWuDjw,588520,591250,is actually one of the best ones in my
eaLrWkWuDjw,591250,593260,opinion because I had the paint pretty
eaLrWkWuDjw,593260,596020,dense and I was also working really fast
eaLrWkWuDjw,596020,598480,switching back and forth between colors
eaLrWkWuDjw,598480,600730,it seems to work better when you spray
eaLrWkWuDjw,600730,603280,the next color before the previous color
eaLrWkWuDjw,603280,606010,closes in like keep the water portal
eaLrWkWuDjw,606010,608500,open so you have a clear space to spray
eaLrWkWuDjw,608500,610330,into and everything just works a lot
eaLrWkWuDjw,610330,612460,smoother that way so this one came out
eaLrWkWuDjw,612460,615070,pretty decent I think it looks good kind
eaLrWkWuDjw,615070,617470,of cool but then on the next one I
eaLrWkWuDjw,617470,620350,relapsed I almost want to try this again
eaLrWkWuDjw,620350,622390,because watching myself do it I
eaLrWkWuDjw,622390,624490,definitely think I could improve if I
eaLrWkWuDjw,624490,626350,did this over but it's hard to tell in
eaLrWkWuDjw,626350,627760,the moment what you're doing wrong you
eaLrWkWuDjw,627760,629500,know but with this one I think I just
eaLrWkWuDjw,629500,631150,slowed down a little bit too much
eaLrWkWuDjw,631150,633610,spraying too close to the water and I
eaLrWkWuDjw,633610,637750,also left quite a few bare spots even so
eaLrWkWuDjw,637750,639940,this one isn't the worst one that I've
eaLrWkWuDjw,639940,642520,done so far so I guess it's okay pretty
eaLrWkWuDjw,642520,645220,cool on to another palette I do realize
eaLrWkWuDjw,645220,647590,that you can hydro dip multiple things
eaLrWkWuDjw,647590,650650,with one round of paint and get more use
eaLrWkWuDjw,650650,653290,out of the paint but I was really just
eaLrWkWuDjw,653290,655840,focusing on one thing at a time I was
eaLrWkWuDjw,655840,658540,barely having success with that much so
eaLrWkWuDjw,658540,661090,this one had some really really
eaLrWkWuDjw,661090,663790,significant wrinkles I had no idea what
eaLrWkWuDjw,663790,665320,was causing it oh this is kind of
eaLrWkWuDjw,665320,667270,embarrassing I realized that I had
eaLrWkWuDjw,667270,669520,forgotten to remove a clear protective
eaLrWkWuDjw,669520,673150,plastic and so here's me skinning it and
eaLrWkWuDjw,673150,675490,it's it's dead now here I go trying
eaLrWkWuDjw,675490,677590,again to make that full rainbow thing
eaLrWkWuDjw,677590,680020,happen you know every time I see someone
eaLrWkWuDjw,680020,682390,else hydro dipping I just think it looks
eaLrWkWuDjw,682390,685480,amazing but when I do it I feel like it
eaLrWkWuDjw,685480,687550,doesn't look right maybe all of you
eaLrWkWuDjw,687550,688990,think that this stuff looks great
eaLrWkWuDjw,688990,692050,hopefully why is my vision getting
eaLrWkWuDjw,692050,696250,blurry what else can we hydro dip about
eaLrWkWuDjw,696250,698980,an outlet cover it looks like I'm being
eaLrWkWuDjw,698980,700530,birthed
eaLrWkWuDjw,700530,703390,anyway I'm working on the paint for an
eaLrWkWuDjw,703390,704470,outlet cover
eaLrWkWuDjw,704470,706660,if you missed it I decorated a bunch of
eaLrWkWuDjw,706660,708910,my outlet covers last week so if you
eaLrWkWuDjw,708910,710920,want to check it out in the I cards this
eaLrWkWuDjw,710920,713380,one turned out really well one of my
eaLrWkWuDjw,713380,715990,favorite hydro dips yet I think it looks
eaLrWkWuDjw,715990,717730,really good actually I don't really have
eaLrWkWuDjw,717730,719380,any complaints with it wonderful my
eaLrWkWuDjw,719380,721030,coasters are dry this is gonna be the
eaLrWkWuDjw,721030,722770,last thing I hydro dip so let's make
eaLrWkWuDjw,722770,725370,these good
eaLrWkWuDjw,728370,759300,I have got to get out of this room I'll
eaLrWkWuDjw,759300,760800,be back when everything's dried to talk
eaLrWkWuDjw,760800,764160,about what I've done just to point out
