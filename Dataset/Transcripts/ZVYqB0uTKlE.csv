ZVYqB0uTKlE,1160,4529,The writings on the wall. If anything we will have to think of something
ZVYqB0uTKlE,4529,8250,to make the public think kindly towards administration because of the Europass.
ZVYqB0uTKlE,8250,9620,Quite... Europass??
ZVYqB0uTKlE,9620,13509,"Europass?? European Identity Card. Well, Bernard, surely"
ZVYqB0uTKlE,13509,16090,"you've informed the minister of... Minister, didn't you do your boxes last night."
ZVYqB0uTKlE,16090,21590,"No, I was redrafting the redraft of the draft. Briefly, Minister, Brussels is about to decree"
ZVYqB0uTKlE,21590,26099,that there should be a new European Identity Card to be carried by all the citizens of
ZVYqB0uTKlE,26099,27820,the EEC. Good Lord...
ZVYqB0uTKlE,27820,32689,The Foreign Office is quite really to go along with it as a quid pro quo for a deal over
ZVYqB0uTKlE,32689,41260,"the butter mountain, the wine lake and milk ocean... The lamb war and the cod stick..."
ZVYqB0uTKlE,41260,45288,And quite obviously the Prime Minister wants you to introduce the legislation.
ZVYqB0uTKlE,45289,47430,"Me? Yes, it's well known that you're pro-Europe,"
ZVYqB0uTKlE,47430,51879,"you see... And it would simplify our administration enormously in the long run, so it's a good"
ZVYqB0uTKlE,51879,53340,idea. Good idea!?
ZVYqB0uTKlE,53340,55710,Good Idea!!?? GOOD IDEA!!!???
ZVYqB0uTKlE,55710,57590,Not a good idea? Political suicide!
ZVYqB0uTKlE,57590,61769,Trying to make British citizens carry compulsory identification papers!
ZVYqB0uTKlE,61769,64010,They'll say I'm introducing a Police State again!
ZVYqB0uTKlE,64010,68520,"That's why we fought two World Wars for, Humphrey? Well, Minister, it's really little more than"
ZVYqB0uTKlE,68520,71719,"a sort of a driving license. It's the last nail in my coffin, that's what"
ZVYqB0uTKlE,71720,74020,it is! You might get away with it by calling it EuroClub
ZVYqB0uTKlE,74020,78909,"Express... Bernard, get out!"
ZVYqB0uTKlE,78910,81790,Why do we have to introduce it? Can't the Foreign Office do it?
ZVYqB0uTKlE,81790,86060,"While in fact, that's the Prime Minister original suggestion but the Foreign Secretary thought"
ZVYqB0uTKlE,86060,90500,this was a Home Office matter and the Home Office took the view that it was essentially
ZVYqB0uTKlE,90500,92470,an administrative matter and the prime minister agreed.
ZVYqB0uTKlE,92470,96310,They are all playing pass the parcel! Can you blame them when you can hear it ticking...
ZVYqB0uTKlE,96310,104119,"Well, I'm afraid that the identity card bill is planned to be the last action of this department..."
ZVYqB0uTKlE,104120,108190,Wonderful ammunition for the anti-Europeans... Does the Foreign Office realize what damage
ZVYqB0uTKlE,108190,112060,"this will do to the European ideal? I'm sure they do, that's why they support"
ZVYqB0uTKlE,112060,115180,"it. But.. Surely the Foreign Office is pro-Europe,"
ZVYqB0uTKlE,115180,120200,"isn't it? Yes and no, if you forgive the expression."
ZVYqB0uTKlE,120200,124960,The Foreign Office is pro-Europe because it is really anti-Europe.
ZVYqB0uTKlE,124960,131140,The Civil Service was united in it's desire to make sure the Common Market didn't work.
ZVYqB0uTKlE,131140,134170,That's why we went into it. What are you talking about?!
ZVYqB0uTKlE,134170,140200,"Minister, Britain has had the same Foreign Policy objective for at least the last 500"
ZVYqB0uTKlE,140200,144470,years. To create a disunited Europe!
ZVYqB0uTKlE,144470,147780,"In that cause we have fought the with the Dutch against the Spanish, with the Germans"
ZVYqB0uTKlE,147780,151560,"against the French, With the French and Italians against the Germans and with the French against"
ZVYqB0uTKlE,151560,155200,"the Germans and Italians. Divide and rule, you see!"
ZVYqB0uTKlE,155200,158690,Why should we change now when it has worked so well!
ZVYqB0uTKlE,158690,163990,"Ancient history, surely! Yes, and current policy!"
ZVYqB0uTKlE,163990,167850,We had to break the whole thing up so we had to get inside.
ZVYqB0uTKlE,167850,170650,We tried to break it out from the outside but that wouldn't work.
ZVYqB0uTKlE,170650,176310,No that we're inside we can make a complete pig's breakfast of the whole thing!
ZVYqB0uTKlE,176310,180099,"Set the Germans against the French, the French against the Italians, the Italians against"
ZVYqB0uTKlE,180100,183290,the Dutch! The Foreign Office is terribly pleased!
ZVYqB0uTKlE,183290,188370,It's just like the old times! Surely we are all committed to the European
ZVYqB0uTKlE,188370,191049,"ideal! Really, Minister..."
ZVYqB0uTKlE,191050,194780,"If not, why are we pressing for an increase in the membership?"
ZVYqB0uTKlE,194780,198340,"Well, for the same reason. It's just like the United Nations in fact."
ZVYqB0uTKlE,198340,202110,"The more members it has, the more arguments it can stir up."
ZVYqB0uTKlE,202110,206290,The more futile and impotent it becomes. Appalling cynicism...
ZVYqB0uTKlE,206290,210189,"Yes... We call it diplomacy, minister."
