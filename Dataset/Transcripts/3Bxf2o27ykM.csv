3Bxf2o27ykM,160,2240,netherrite the uber strong material that
3Bxf2o27ykM,2240,4640,makes diamond look like cobblestone a
3Bxf2o27ykM,4640,6799,material so powerful that it's hiding in
3Bxf2o27ykM,6799,8480,the depths of the scariest part of
3Bxf2o27ykM,8480,11040,minecraft's world the nether it's so
3Bxf2o27ykM,11040,12559,rare that it feels like you can only
3Bxf2o27ykM,12559,14639,find it in your dreams
3Bxf2o27ykM,14639,15759,well it's not like any of us are going
3Bxf2o27ykM,15759,17600,to be doing much sleep tonight but why
3Bxf2o27ykM,17600,20640,is it so hard to find what is netherrite
3Bxf2o27ykM,20640,22240,and where does it come from trust me
3Bxf2o27ykM,22240,24320,this is no simple origin tale friends it
3Bxf2o27ykM,24320,26160,takes us from the depths of the nether
3Bxf2o27ykM,26160,28160,to the reaches of outer space and
3Bxf2o27ykM,28160,30240,ultimately to the secret origins of
3Bxf2o27ykM,30240,34320,minecraft's long-lost lore
3Bxf2o27ykM,36160,39280,hello internet welcome to game theory
3Bxf2o27ykM,39280,40640,the show that's doing the hard work of
3Bxf2o27ykM,40640,42480,piecing together minecraft slore because
3Bxf2o27ykM,42480,44879,clearly mojang ain't gonna do it for us
3Bxf2o27ykM,44879,47520,we really want people to try to figure
3Bxf2o27ykM,47520,49440,these things out by themselves keeping
3Bxf2o27ykM,49440,51039,the sense of mystery well if the
3Bxf2o27ykM,51039,52160,minecraft lore is supposed to be a
3Bxf2o27ykM,52160,54239,mystery then consider me your persistent
3Bxf2o27ykM,54239,56399,detective so far we've covered a lot of
3Bxf2o27ykM,56399,58079,minecraft lore on the channel covering
3Bxf2o27ykM,58079,60079,the history of this ancient builder race
3Bxf2o27ykM,60079,61520,that constructed the monuments that we
3Bxf2o27ykM,61520,63199,see throughout the world something that
3Bxf2o27ykM,63199,65439,kind of got confirmed by mojang recently
3Bxf2o27ykM,65439,68080,so the lowdown is these cities they come
3Bxf2o27ykM,68080,70840,from an ancient civilization
3Bxf2o27ykM,70840,73920,but are you still recording we've also
3Bxf2o27ykM,73920,75439,talked in the past about the nether and
3Bxf2o27ykM,75439,77280,why those soul sand valleys are even
3Bxf2o27ykM,77280,79439,creepier than they seem however across
3Bxf2o27ykM,79439,81040,all this discussion of nether and the
3Bxf2o27ykM,81040,83119,wider minecraft lore we haven't talked
3Bxf2o27ykM,83119,84240,about one of the most important
3Bxf2o27ykM,84240,86320,materials that you find down there
3Bxf2o27ykM,86320,87920,netherright although netherride is one
3Bxf2o27ykM,87920,90000,of minecraft's newest materials only
3Bxf2o27ykM,90000,92000,coming out in june of 2020 wait it's
3Bxf2o27ykM,92000,93920,only been a year since it was introduced
3Bxf2o27ykM,93920,96640,wow seems like it's been forever time is
3Bxf2o27ykM,96640,98640,just an illusion man anyway despite it
3Bxf2o27ykM,98640,100640,being so new from a lore standpoint
3Bxf2o27ykM,100640,102159,netherite is one of the minecraft
3Bxf2o27ykM,102159,104240,world's oldest mysteries since that
3Bxf2o27ykM,104240,106159,update buried deep within the nether you
3Bxf2o27ykM,106159,108479,can chance upon ancient debris emphasis
3Bxf2o27ykM,108479,110079,on the word ancient which you can then
3Bxf2o27ykM,110079,112399,smelt to form netherrite scraps for
3Bxf2o27ykM,112399,114159,those combined with four golden ingots
3Bxf2o27ykM,114159,115759,gets you a netherright ingot which you
3Bxf2o27ykM,115759,117439,can then use to upgrade your diamond
3Bxf2o27ykM,117439,119680,armor into even more powerful gear all
3Bxf2o27ykM,119680,121759,of this then raises the obvious question
3Bxf2o27ykM,121759,124320,what is netherrite clearly it's supposed
3Bxf2o27ykM,124320,126159,to be a fictional substance but when has
3Bxf2o27ykM,126159,128239,that stopped us before so what in real
3Bxf2o27ykM,128239,130560,life is harder than a diamond well
3Bxf2o27ykM,130560,132640,nothing there isn't really anything on
3Bxf2o27ykM,132640,134560,earth that compares the scale that real
3Bxf2o27ykM,134560,136640,world scientists use to measure hardness
3Bxf2o27ykM,136640,138640,the mohs hardness scale was calibrated
3Bxf2o27ykM,138640,141040,to be a 1 to 10 measurement with 10
3Bxf2o27ykM,141040,142879,being the hardest and who set that level
3Bxf2o27ykM,142879,144959,to 10 and is also the only one in that
3Bxf2o27ykM,144959,147599,category you guessed it diamonds i know
3Bxf2o27ykM,147599,148879,that in a previous theory i actually
3Bxf2o27ykM,148879,150480,went on my way to prove that diamonds
3Bxf2o27ykM,150480,152319,weren't actually the best material for
3Bxf2o27ykM,152319,153760,building things like armor because
3Bxf2o27ykM,153760,155360,although they're scientifically hard
3Bxf2o27ykM,155360,157120,they're not necessarily tough which is
3Bxf2o27ykM,157120,158480,just opening up a whole other can of
3Bxf2o27ykM,158480,159840,worms that we've already addressed
3Bxf2o27ykM,159840,161920,anyway since mojang keeps ignoring my
3Bxf2o27ykM,161920,163599,letters to make diamonds more realistic
3Bxf2o27ykM,163599,165120,diamonds are officially the strongest
3Bxf2o27ykM,165120,167280,material for us today so if nothing in
3Bxf2o27ykM,167280,169360,the world is harder than diamond what
3Bxf2o27ykM,169360,171200,then is netherrite that makes it harder
3Bxf2o27ykM,171200,172959,than diamond well what about something
3Bxf2o27ykM,172959,175280,that isn't from this world in the middle
3Bxf2o27ykM,175280,177200,of the arizona desert there's a massive
3Bxf2o27ykM,177200,179840,meteor crater that's over 1.1 kilometers
3Bxf2o27ykM,179840,182800,or 0.7 miles in diameter and it goes
3Bxf2o27ykM,182800,185840,down to a depth of 170 meters or 560
3Bxf2o27ykM,185840,187599,feet i actually got a chance to visit it
3Bxf2o27ykM,187599,188959,myself when stephanie and i moved across
3Bxf2o27ykM,188959,190640,the country last year and trust me the
3Bxf2o27ykM,190640,193120,numbers do not demonstrate how big this
3Bxf2o27ykM,193120,194720,thing is it is
3Bxf2o27ykM,194720,196800,massive as far as scientists can tell
3Bxf2o27ykM,196800,199200,this crater was formed about 50 000
3Bxf2o27ykM,199200,201360,years ago when an asteroid fell from
3Bxf2o27ykM,201360,203920,orbit and struck the earth and boy did
3Bxf2o27ykM,203920,205680,it leave a mark not only that but upon
3Bxf2o27ykM,205680,207120,striking the earth the meteorite
3Bxf2o27ykM,207120,208879,actually shattered into tons of little
3Bxf2o27ykM,208879,211040,pieces but uh little might be a bit of a
3Bxf2o27ykM,211040,212480,stretch here's me and ollie standing
3Bxf2o27ykM,212480,214799,next to the largest fragment ever found
3Bxf2o27ykM,214799,217040,as you can see it's not so little
3Bxf2o27ykM,217040,219120,regardless these fragments went flying
3Bxf2o27ykM,219120,220799,and so scientists have spent decades
3Bxf2o27ykM,220799,222480,hunting them down and excavating these
3Bxf2o27ykM,222480,225040,meteorite fragments in 1967 though they
3Bxf2o27ykM,225040,226720,discovered something that was truly out
3Bxf2o27ykM,226720,228400,of this world blonde's dailyites a
3Bxf2o27ykM,228400,230799,substance that is in fact harder than
3Bxf2o27ykM,230799,232959,diamond despite its outer space origins
3Bxf2o27ykM,232959,234959,lonsdaleite is actually extremely
3Bxf2o27ykM,234959,236319,similar to diamond from a chemical
3Bxf2o27ykM,236319,238560,perspective a diamond is just a lump of
3Bxf2o27ykM,238560,240480,carbon that's been subjected to a lot of
3Bxf2o27ykM,240480,242319,heat and pressure such that the atoms
3Bxf2o27ykM,242319,244239,bond together to form a crystalline
3Bxf2o27ykM,244239,246000,cubic lattice structure blonde's
3Bxf2o27ykM,246000,248000,dailyite also starts off as a lump of
3Bxf2o27ykM,248000,250239,carbon but is subjected to even more
3Bxf2o27ykM,250239,252000,intense heat and pressure causing its
3Bxf2o27ykM,252000,253519,atoms to bond together differently
3Bxf2o27ykM,253519,255120,instead of forming a cubic lattice it
3Bxf2o27ykM,255120,257040,forms a hexagonal lattice which
3Bxf2o27ykM,257040,258639,apparently is even stronger than the
3Bxf2o27ykM,258639,260560,cubic lattice of diamond theoretically a
3Bxf2o27ykM,260560,262000,piece of lonsdaleite with a perfect
3Bxf2o27ykM,262000,264160,hexagonal lattice would be up to 58
3Bxf2o27ykM,264160,266240,percent harder than diamond the big
3Bxf2o27ykM,266240,267440,asterisk here though is that the
3Bxf2o27ykM,267440,268720,lonsdaleian fragments that we've
3Bxf2o27ykM,268720,270720,recovered so far have just a lot of
3Bxf2o27ykM,270720,272639,impurities and as a result only measure
3Bxf2o27ykM,272639,274160,around seven to eight on the mohs
3Bxf2o27ykM,274160,276160,hardness scale but in its pure form lens
3Bxf2o27ykM,276160,278400,dailyite is basically diamond plus
3Bxf2o27ykM,278400,279520,they're both essentially the same
3Bxf2o27ykM,279520,281680,material carbon just subjected to
3Bxf2o27ykM,281680,283280,different levels of heat and pressure
3Bxf2o27ykM,283280,285040,and the fact that it's so similar to an
3Bxf2o27ykM,285040,286720,actual diamond makes it a fascinating
3Bxf2o27ykM,286720,288560,parallel to netherrites because remember
3Bxf2o27ykM,288560,290000,netherright gear isn't just something
3Bxf2o27ykM,290000,291919,that you can create from scratch instead
3Bxf2o27ykM,291919,293280,of putting together a couple of ingots
3Bxf2o27ykM,293280,294800,on top of a stick you need to start from
3Bxf2o27ykM,294800,297199,the base of a diamond sword and then add
3Bxf2o27ykM,297199,299280,a netherite ingot another right gear is
3Bxf2o27ykM,299280,301919,just an upgraded form of diamond gear
3Bxf2o27ykM,301919,303600,not only that but the lons daily
3Bxf2o27ykM,303600,305360,recovered from that 50 000 year old
3Bxf2o27ykM,305360,307440,meteor is all in the form of scattered
3Bxf2o27ykM,307440,309520,fragments which i suppose one could
3Bxf2o27ykM,309520,312240,describe as ancient debris just like it
3Bxf2o27ykM,312240,315199,is in minecraft so what am i saying that
3Bxf2o27ykM,315199,316880,netherright is the remains of ancient
3Bxf2o27ykM,316880,318960,meteorites that fell from space well as
3Bxf2o27ykM,318960,320560,much as i'm tempted to make this episode
3Bxf2o27ykM,320560,322800,about minecraft's ancient aliens the
3Bxf2o27ykM,322800,324800,nether is a closed ecosystem with a
3Bxf2o27ykM,324800,326960,ceiling which means it's completely cut
3Bxf2o27ykM,326960,329280,off from outer space so that seems
3Bxf2o27ykM,329280,331039,pretty unlikely plus the truth about
3Bxf2o27ykM,331039,332800,lonsdaleite is even though we've found
3Bxf2o27ykM,332800,334880,it in meteorites it's not strictly an
3Bxf2o27ykM,334880,336800,alien substance remember it started off
3Bxf2o27ykM,336800,338720,as regular carbon scientists in fact
3Bxf2o27ykM,338720,339919,believe that well it was floating in
3Bxf2o27ykM,339919,341520,space the carbon was just simple
3Bxf2o27ykM,341520,343680,graphite no different from the graphite
3Bxf2o27ykM,343680,345440,that you can find in your pencil but
3Bxf2o27ykM,345440,347280,okay not exactly the same the tip of
3Bxf2o27ykM,347280,350960,your pencil is only 65 graphite 30 clay
3Bxf2o27ykM,350960,352880,and five percent wax and other resins
3Bxf2o27ykM,352880,355120,but still basically the same idea anyway
3Bxf2o27ykM,355120,356720,thanks to the meteorite size it was big
3Bxf2o27ykM,356720,358000,enough to survive the heat and pressure
3Bxf2o27ykM,358000,359759,of entering our atmosphere and in turn
3Bxf2o27ykM,359759,361440,created the conditions necessary to
3Bxf2o27ykM,361440,363600,create lonsdaleites now if only there
3Bxf2o27ykM,363600,365440,were somewhere in minecraft that was
3Bxf2o27ykM,365440,368560,super hot and pressurized hmm
3Bxf2o27ykM,368560,370479,oh wait there is a reason it's called
3Bxf2o27ykM,370479,372319,netherrite after all places like the
3Bxf2o27ykM,372319,373919,overworld and the end simply don't have
3Bxf2o27ykM,373919,375600,the environmental conditions necessary
3Bxf2o27ykM,375600,377600,to create this stuff not only that but
3Bxf2o27ykM,377600,380080,netherrite in item form literally floats
3Bxf2o27ykM,380080,381919,on lava seems like a pretty useful
3Bxf2o27ykM,381919,384000,property for any civilization making its
3Bxf2o27ykM,384000,386479,home down in the nether so was netherite
3Bxf2o27ykM,386479,388319,made by this ancient race of builders
3Bxf2o27ykM,388319,390720,that i keep harping on about i doubt it
3Bxf2o27ykM,390720,392319,we believe the ancient builders to have
3Bxf2o27ykM,392319,394160,come to the nether centuries ago they
3Bxf2o27ykM,394160,396160,built the nether fortresses that we find
3Bxf2o27ykM,396160,398080,storing their loot in their chests they
3Bxf2o27ykM,398080,399919,farmed netherwort to feed their pigs and
3Bxf2o27ykM,399919,401840,they did weird experiments to revive the
3Bxf2o27ykM,401840,403680,souls of their fallen comrades but
3Bxf2o27ykM,403680,405680,through it all netherrite and ancient
3Bxf2o27ykM,405680,408000,debris are nowhere to be found you never
3Bxf2o27ykM,408000,409680,just see it lying around a fortress or
3Bxf2o27ykM,409680,411840,used to fortify any defenses it's not
3Bxf2o27ykM,411840,413599,found in any chest it could be that
3Bxf2o27ykM,413599,415280,mojang just never updated the nether
3Bxf2o27ykM,415280,416880,fortresses but they never have been
3Bxf2o27ykM,416880,418720,afraid to change old elements to include
3Bxf2o27ykM,418720,421199,new ones for example drowned now don't
3Bxf2o27ykM,421199,423360,drop gold but copper which feels like a
3Bxf2o27ykM,423360,425120,pretty major change so it must be a
3Bxf2o27ykM,425120,427120,purposeful decision to not include those
3Bxf2o27ykM,427120,428720,elements in the nether fortress meaning
3Bxf2o27ykM,428720,430240,that the ancient builders aren't the
3Bxf2o27ykM,430240,432319,ones that we're looking for however in a
3Bxf2o27ykM,432319,434319,surprising twist mojang did actually
3Bxf2o27ykM,434319,435840,hint at some of the lore implications
3Bxf2o27ykM,435840,437680,when the nether update happened back in
3Bxf2o27ykM,437680,440160,2020 take a look at this quote piglens
3Bxf2o27ykM,440160,442319,mined it all out now the only way to
3Bxf2o27ykM,442319,444160,obtain it is by salvaging netherrite
3Bxf2o27ykM,444160,446800,scrap from ancient debris the piglen can
3Bxf2o27ykM,446800,449120,mine blocks this is not a mechanic that
3Bxf2o27ykM,449120,451599,we ever see in the game piglens can hunt
3Bxf2o27ykM,451599,453759,they can barter they can even dance but
3Bxf2o27ykM,453759,456639,we never see them mine which means this
3Bxf2o27ykM,456639,459759,isn't a game mechanic but war
3Bxf2o27ykM,459759,462160,sweet juicy lore if they're capable of
3Bxf2o27ykM,462160,463680,mining as well as the other things that
3Bxf2o27ykM,463680,465280,we just mentioned what else could they
3Bxf2o27ykM,465280,467440,do how about starting a civilization
3Bxf2o27ykM,467440,469280,think about it there isn't just one type
3Bxf2o27ykM,469280,470960,of piglen much like villagers and
3Bxf2o27ykM,470960,472479,illiters there are a couple of
3Bxf2o27ykM,472479,475039,variations of piglens namely the piglin
3Bxf2o27ykM,475039,477039,brute they hunt in teams they celebrate
3Bxf2o27ykM,477039,478800,together in victory plus they're able to
3Bxf2o27ykM,478800,480960,barter with us for resources if this
3Bxf2o27ykM,480960,482960,isn't a society well then i don't know
3Bxf2o27ykM,482960,484879,what you're defining a society as but it
3Bxf2o27ykM,484879,486879,doesn't stop there piglets are found all
3Bxf2o27ykM,486879,488319,over the nether but there's one very
3Bxf2o27ykM,488319,489840,particular place where they're found
3Bxf2o27ykM,489840,492240,congregating bastion remnants which if
3Bxf2o27ykM,492240,493680,the name doesn't give it away aren't
3Bxf2o27ykM,493680,495840,entirely in one piece they're remnants
3Bxf2o27ykM,495840,497840,of their former selves clearly in the
3Bxf2o27ykM,497840,499520,lore of the game piglens have been able
3Bxf2o27ykM,499520,501759,to form societies build civilizations
3Bxf2o27ykM,501759,504160,and defend against intruders who then
3Bxf2o27ykM,504160,505599,were the intruders given the fact that
3Bxf2o27ykM,505599,507759,piglens are immediately hostile to you
3Bxf2o27ykM,507759,509280,the player i would suspect that they're
3Bxf2o27ykM,509280,511680,at war against the ancient builders our
3Bxf2o27ykM,511680,513599,ancestors this would first of all
3Bxf2o27ykM,513599,515360,explain the ruined state of the bastions
3Bxf2o27ykM,515360,517039,but would also explain what all the
3Bxf2o27ykM,517039,519039,natural netherrite was mined for in the
3Bxf2o27ykM,519039,521039,first place if they're under attack
3Bxf2o27ykM,521039,522560,netherrite would provide them the
3Bxf2o27ykM,522560,524399,perfect defense the ancient builders
3Bxf2o27ykM,524399,526640,were using diamond gear so why not
3Bxf2o27ykM,526640,528399,counter with a fortress made of
3Bxf2o27ykM,528399,530640,netherrite parts it's fire resistant
3Bxf2o27ykM,530640,532160,it's perfect for being built into the
3Bxf2o27ykM,532160,533839,landscape of the nether and it's super
3Bxf2o27ykM,533839,536000,strong however like most natural
3Bxf2o27ykM,536000,538240,resources it will eventually begin to
3Bxf2o27ykM,538240,540240,run out their defenses weaken and
3Bxf2o27ykM,540240,542000,although netherite is stronger than
3Bxf2o27ykM,542000,544160,diamond it's not indestructible so with
3Bxf2o27ykM,544160,545839,no netherite left to replace the broken
3Bxf2o27ykM,545839,548399,parts the bastions fall and are left in
3Bxf2o27ykM,548399,550800,ruin the piglens seem to have won the
3Bxf2o27ykM,550800,552320,war i mean look who's still kicking
3Bxf2o27ykM,552320,553839,around the nether in the present day but
3Bxf2o27ykM,553839,555920,they lost the most valuable resource
3Bxf2o27ykM,555920,557519,that they had in the process as
3Bxf2o27ykM,557519,559279,centuries passed those bastions that
3Bxf2o27ykM,559279,561360,fell became buried underground much like
3Bxf2o27ykM,561360,563120,the ancient cities that exist in our
3Bxf2o27ykM,563120,564560,world but with netherrite's fire
3Bxf2o27ykM,564560,566320,resistance any broken scraps that were
3Bxf2o27ykM,566320,568160,left in the bastions would survive the
3Bxf2o27ykM,568160,570160,lava flows and ground shifts so it would
3Bxf2o27ykM,570160,571920,never really decompose leaving us with
3Bxf2o27ykM,571920,573440,the ancient debris buried deep
3Bxf2o27ykM,573440,575120,underground that we know today something
3Bxf2o27ykM,575120,576320,else i always thought was weird about
3Bxf2o27ykM,576320,577680,the bastions that you can find
3Bxf2o27ykM,577680,579200,netherrite and ancient debris in the
3Bxf2o27ykM,579200,581920,chests but not netherrite tools or armor
3Bxf2o27ykM,581920,584160,with this in mind it does kind of make
3Bxf2o27ykM,584160,586000,sense there are no diamonds in the
3Bxf2o27ykM,586000,587600,nether so they had no means to make
3Bxf2o27ykM,587600,589760,netherright gear they had plenty of gold
3Bxf2o27ykM,589760,591680,so they could make ingots and blocks in
3Bxf2o27ykM,591680,593680,order to fortify their bastions it would
3Bxf2o27ykM,593680,595680,also explain the piglen's affinity for
3Bxf2o27ykM,595680,597120,gold what do we use to create a
3Bxf2o27ykM,597120,599519,netherright ingot four scraps and four
3Bxf2o27ykM,599519,600959,gold ingots knowing that they have a
3Bxf2o27ykM,600959,602399,limited amount of pure netherite the
3Bxf2o27ykM,602399,603839,piglens have resorted to making a
3Bxf2o27ykM,603839,606079,netherite alloy of sorts using one of
3Bxf2o27ykM,606079,607760,the other natural resources that they
3Bxf2o27ykM,607760,609680,have down in the nether gold which is
3Bxf2o27ykM,609680,610880,why they're willing to give you all
3Bxf2o27ykM,610880,613200,matter of items for even a single nugget
3Bxf2o27ykM,613200,614399,they're trying to collect whatever
3Bxf2o27ykM,614399,616079,scraps they can to rebuild their
3Bxf2o27ykM,616079,618160,civilization after the ancient builders
3Bxf2o27ykM,618160,620160,destroyed it and their hatred still
3Bxf2o27ykM,620160,621680,stands today why else would they be
3Bxf2o27ykM,621680,623360,immediately hostile to you you're an
3Bxf2o27ykM,623360,625519,invasive species one whose kind has
3Bxf2o27ykM,625519,627120,already been down here before and
3Bxf2o27ykM,627120,629440,brought ruin to their thriving society
3Bxf2o27ykM,629440,631600,piglets get especially mad when you try
3Bxf2o27ykM,631600,633519,and take a look in the bastion chests
3Bxf2o27ykM,633519,635200,now you're trying to steal the limited
3Bxf2o27ykM,635200,637040,resources that they have left to rebuild
3Bxf2o27ykM,637040,639040,what they once were they've even trained
3Bxf2o27ykM,639040,641440,piglet brutes to not be blinded by gold
3Bxf2o27ykM,641440,643279,to just remove that intruder at all
3Bxf2o27ykM,643279,645360,costs in the end much like we find
3Bxf2o27ykM,645360,647200,ourselves trying to piece together clues
3Bxf2o27ykM,647200,648560,that we find throughout minecraft to
3Bxf2o27ykM,648560,650640,construct a history of this world the
3Bxf2o27ykM,650640,652320,piglens themselves might be in the same
3Bxf2o27ykM,652320,654079,position piecing together remnants of
3Bxf2o27ykM,654079,656480,their past in order to reconstruct their
3Bxf2o27ykM,656480,660399,history but hey that's just a theory a
3Bxf2o27ykM,660399,664470,game theory thanks for watching
3Bxf2o27ykM,664470,682230,[Music]
3Bxf2o27ykM,683120,685200,you
