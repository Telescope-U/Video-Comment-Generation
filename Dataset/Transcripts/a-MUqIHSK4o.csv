a-MUqIHSK4o,525279,526959,sorry i didn't hear that
a-MUqIHSK4o,526959,528720,i was asking do you believe we need
a-MUqIHSK4o,528720,530560,legislative changes to serve as a
a-MUqIHSK4o,530560,532800,deterrent to these vicious attacks on
a-MUqIHSK4o,532800,535040,our children
a-MUqIHSK4o,535040,538320,i'm not hearing you well
a-MUqIHSK4o,539680,541440,are you still there you're here

a-MUqIHSK4o,542720,545440,harrison i can hear you now yes okay so
a-MUqIHSK4o,545440,547200,my question is do you believe we need
a-MUqIHSK4o,547200,549200,legislative changes to serve as a
a-MUqIHSK4o,549200,552399,deterrent to these vicious attacks on
a-MUqIHSK4o,552399,554080,our children
a-MUqIHSK4o,554080,556399,i know you know every time we have this
a-MUqIHSK4o,556399,558399,conversation or we talk about
a-MUqIHSK4o,558399,561200,legislation which is perhaps a very
a-MUqIHSK4o,561200,563279,natural response the legislation is
a-MUqIHSK4o,563279,565760,there we do have the legislative
a-MUqIHSK4o,565760,568000,framework what we need now
a-MUqIHSK4o,568000,569200,is for the
a-MUqIHSK4o,569200,571360,evidence to come forward within the
a-MUqIHSK4o,571360,573600,confines of the existing legislation
a-MUqIHSK4o,573600,576080,because i mean this is murder um you
a-MUqIHSK4o,576080,579200,know we have very serious uh pieces of
a-MUqIHSK4o,579200,581839,legislation on the books for example we
a-MUqIHSK4o,581839,583760,don't use the term capital murder
a-MUqIHSK4o,583760,586880,anymore but certainly wherever you have
a-MUqIHSK4o,586880,589760,a murder that has occurred and there are
a-MUqIHSK4o,589760,592800,four deaths in that one incident it is
a-MUqIHSK4o,592800,595600,open to the prosecution at trial to ask
a-MUqIHSK4o,595600,599120,for the very extreme penalty of this so
a-MUqIHSK4o,599120,601200,we do have the legislative provision but
a-MUqIHSK4o,601200,604320,before we even get there we need to have
a-MUqIHSK4o,604320,606320,persons who are witnesses
a-MUqIHSK4o,606320,608480,persons who have information that could
a-MUqIHSK4o,608480,611839,assist come forward so that first we can
a-MUqIHSK4o,611839,614160,build a solid case
a-MUqIHSK4o,614160,615920,against the would-be perpetrator i'm
a-MUqIHSK4o,615920,618480,very encouraged though that having heard
a-MUqIHSK4o,618480,620640,the commission of police at least one
a-MUqIHSK4o,620640,623440,person of interest has been identified
a-MUqIHSK4o,623440,626079,so far so that's encouraging that people
