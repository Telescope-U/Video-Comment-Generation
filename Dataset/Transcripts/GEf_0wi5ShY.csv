GEf_0wi5ShY,1458,3250,There are many ways to get the things
GEf_0wi5ShY,3250,5708,"that we want for ourselves in our lives,"
GEf_0wi5ShY,5708,6958,but 
GEf_0wi5ShY,6958,8208,basically
GEf_0wi5ShY,8208,9333,it all begins with
GEf_0wi5ShY,9333,11791,how we choose to think.
GEf_0wi5ShY,11791,14208,"As you think,"
GEf_0wi5ShY,14208,15916,so shall you be.
GEf_0wi5ShY,15916,18000,I wanna know why you do what you do.
GEf_0wi5ShY,18000,20666,What is your motive for action?
GEf_0wi5ShY,20666,22583,"What is it that drives you in your life today,"
GEf_0wi5ShY,22583,24958,"not 10 years ago, or you running the same pattern?"
GEf_0wi5ShY,24958,27875," or your web, the needs, the beliefs,"
GEf_0wi5ShY,27875,30333,"the emotions that are controlling you, for two reasons."
GEf_0wi5ShY,30333,32791,"So there's more of you to give, and achieve too,"
GEf_0wi5ShY,32791,34583,"we all wanna do it, but I mean give,"
GEf_0wi5ShY,34583,35875,'cause that's what's gonna fill you up.
GEf_0wi5ShY,35875,38208,"And secondly, so you can appreciate,"
GEf_0wi5ShY,38208,40375,"not just understand, that's intellectual, that's the mind,"
GEf_0wi5ShY,40375,42916,but appreciate what's driving other people.
GEf_0wi5ShY,42916,44125,It's the only way our world's gonna change.
GEf_0wi5ShY,44916,46500,Everyone's going to hit adversity.
GEf_0wi5ShY,46500,48125,Everyone's going to hit adversity.
GEf_0wi5ShY,48125,50041,It's how you deal with that adversity.
GEf_0wi5ShY,50041,51666,"And the key word is ""You"" "
GEf_0wi5ShY,51666,54625,not letting somebody else deal with that adversity.
GEf_0wi5ShY,54625,57000,You have to deal with that adversity 
GEf_0wi5ShY,57000,58375,and how you deal with it.
GEf_0wi5ShY,58375,59875,Are you going to fight through it
GEf_0wi5ShY,59875,61708,or are you going to curl up 
GEf_0wi5ShY,61708,63750,and just roll over into the corner?
GEf_0wi5ShY,63750,65958,It gonna pretty much determine 
GEf_0wi5ShY,65958,68750,how the rest of your development 
GEf_0wi5ShY,68750,73375,from a mental standpoint is going to carry you.
GEf_0wi5ShY,73375,76833,You can not win the war against the world 
GEf_0wi5ShY,76833,80125,if you can't win the war against your own mind.
GEf_0wi5ShY,80791,83708,"but it first starts with a sound, right?"
GEf_0wi5ShY,83708,85791,There's this sound that I hear 
GEf_0wi5ShY,85791,87750,and that sound moves me
GEf_0wi5ShY,87750,88083,All right.
GEf_0wi5ShY,88083,89250,That sound moves me.
GEf_0wi5ShY,89250,93666,"So this was a sound that I heard years ago, "
GEf_0wi5ShY,93666,96125,and there are times in my life where I just stopped 
GEf_0wi5ShY,96125,98875,and I play the sound.
GEf_0wi5ShY,98875,101416,"Because it does something for me internally, "
GEf_0wi5ShY,101416,103458,it moves me. Write that down.
GEf_0wi5ShY,103458,105458,The very first thing that needs to happen to you
GEf_0wi5ShY,105458,107291,every single day 
GEf_0wi5ShY,107291,109500,is you need to be moved.
GEf_0wi5ShY,109500,111250,"You need to be moved, "
GEf_0wi5ShY,111250,114541,"whatever it is that you can do, literally to insight it."
GEf_0wi5ShY,114541,115750,Listen to me very closely.
GEf_0wi5ShY,115750,117958,When I say find something that moves you.
GEf_0wi5ShY,117958,119958,What most of you do wrong is you're waiting
GEf_0wi5ShY,119958,122541,for something to move you.
GEf_0wi5ShY,123000,126791,Instead of creating the thing every day that moves you
GEf_0wi5ShY,126791,129207,"And the reason why I say find something that moves you, "
GEf_0wi5ShY,129207,132625,because what separates humans 
GEf_0wi5ShY,132625,133666,is our effort.
GEf_0wi5ShY,133666,136125,"There's some of us, we give 70% of what we do, "
GEf_0wi5ShY,136125,137375,some of us 80%.
GEf_0wi5ShY,137375,138625,Some of us 90%.
GEf_0wi5ShY,138625,139625,Some of us 100%
GEf_0wi5ShY,139625,141291,Some of us are 120%.
GEf_0wi5ShY,141291,145166,"And so when you move and you are moved,"
GEf_0wi5ShY,145166,149458,it allows you to operate at a whole different level.
GEf_0wi5ShY,149458,151958,We kind of have this idea that 
GEf_0wi5ShY,151958,154083,"while you're free as a child, and then you..."
GEf_0wi5ShY,154083,155875,"That you have a certain delightful,"
GEf_0wi5ShY,155875,158000,"wonderful, positive freedom as a child,"
GEf_0wi5ShY,158000,161583,and then that's given up as you approach adulthood.
GEf_0wi5ShY,161583,164000,"But the truth of the matter is, that "
GEf_0wi5ShY,164000,165750,"you have a lot of potential as a child,"
GEf_0wi5ShY,165750,168083,but none of that is capable of manifesting itself.
GEf_0wi5ShY,168083,170750,As freedom before you become disciplined.
GEf_0wi5ShY,170750,172875,And discipline is a matter of the imposition of order.
GEf_0wi5ShY,172875,174083,"And the order is necessary, "
GEf_0wi5ShY,174083,176750,"especially for people who are hopeless and nihilistic,"
GEf_0wi5ShY,176750,179583,"and lots of people are hopeless and nihilistic,"
GEf_0wi5ShY,179583,181583,Way more people than you think.
GEf_0wi5ShY,181583,182750,And part of that is because 
GEf_0wi5ShY,182750,184666,no one's ever really encouraged them.
GEf_0wi5ShY,184666,187333,"And so the book is in part, a matter of encouragement,"
GEf_0wi5ShY,187333,189125,"it's like lay yourself,"
GEf_0wi5ShY,189125,191333,"lay a disciplinary structure on yourself,"
GEf_0wi5ShY,191333,193333,"get the chaos in check, "
GEf_0wi5ShY,193333,195915,and then you can move towards a state that's free
GEf_0wi5ShY,195916,197041,because it's disciplined first.
GEf_0wi5ShY,197041,199583,"Like, look, if you're going to become a concert pianist"
GEf_0wi5ShY,199583,202125,there's going to be several thousand hours
GEf_0wi5ShY,202125,203916,of extraordinarily disciplined practice.
GEf_0wi5ShY,203916,206875,"That's the imposition of order on your potential, let's say,"
GEf_0wi5ShY,206875,210416,but what comes out of that is a much grander freedom.
GEf_0wi5ShY,210416,212958,And so in virtually every freedom that you have in life.
GEf_0wi5ShY,212958,216165,That's true freedom is purchased at the price of discipline.
GEf_0wi5ShY,216166,218416,"At some point, you gotta start winning."
GEf_0wi5ShY,218416,220958,You can't always look for other people to help you.
GEf_0wi5ShY,220958,222625,"Other people got their own problems, "
GEf_0wi5ShY,222625,224416,they got their own sh*t they gotta deal with
GEf_0wi5ShY,224416,226625,they're trying to achieve their own goals.
GEf_0wi5ShY,226625,230000,"They are willing to assist, but after a while,"
GEf_0wi5ShY,230000,232666,"if you constantly looking for assistance,"
GEf_0wi5ShY,232666,233833,constantly looking for help.
GEf_0wi5ShY,233833,235208,it's on you
GEf_0wi5ShY,235208,239375,your failure and your success is on you.
