dOyrx5HOCyY,719,6240,did  did linus went to the university  i don't think you need to worry about
dOyrx5HOCyY,6240,13120,that  welcome to the rancho ladies and  gentlemen we've got a fantastic show  lined up for you all today
dOyrx5HOCyY,13120,21359,first and foremost we are going to need  to address  the early reviews for intel's arc gpus
dOyrx5HOCyY,21359,26800,it is  not looking good also
dOyrx5HOCyY,26800,32238,buzzfeed news listens to tock listen to  us  uh
dOyrx5HOCyY,32238,39440,i have not reviewed the topics for this  week apparently that's a main one so i  guess we'll talk about that
dOyrx5HOCyY,39440,45280,what else we got also a response to  critical  critical i hope i'm saying that name
dOyrx5HOCyY,45280,52000,correctly but chronicle  um and yeah  in regards to featured main topics uh
dOyrx5HOCyY,52000,58719,we're out of them now so we're diving  into the other ones and i'm going to say  uh github copilot i don't know i have a
dOyrx5HOCyY,58719,64799,few things to say about that it costs 10  now or 100 a year  there you go and it's more widely
dOyrx5HOCyY,64799,70479,available question mark i thought sort  of everyone had access to it before but  maybe not uh but yeah now it's more
dOyrx5HOCyY,70479,76400,generally available and it costs money  that was basically the whole topic no  there's more to it man we got to talk
dOyrx5HOCyY,76400,82980,about it for like at least 60 seconds  [Music]
dOyrx5HOCyY,88140,99600,[Music]
dOyrx5HOCyY,99600,105200,show is brought to you by pulse way  back blaze and ubiquity oh okay i don't
dOyrx5HOCyY,105200,110479,think ubiquity's ever sponsored the wan  show before that's pretty cool hey  thanks ubiquity and also yeah yeah
dOyrx5HOCyY,110479,115840,impulsively impact please why don't we  jump right into our first topic of the
dOyrx5HOCyY,115840,122640,day  which is that the early reviews for  intel arc graphics are not looking good
dOyrx5HOCyY,122640,129440,you know we talked about this  way back at the height of the gpu  shortage we were like man
dOyrx5HOCyY,129440,134560,intel's got to ship these gpus now  because even though we know they've been
dOyrx5HOCyY,134560,141120,delayed and we know that they might not  be on par with the best from amd and  nvidia right out of the gate you know
dOyrx5HOCyY,141120,148800,first generation woes right if they  manage to ship something today  it's an automatic w because the pricing
dOyrx5HOCyY,148800,154720,for everything else is so utterly  ridiculous that they couldn't possibly  look like idiots and yet their timing
dOyrx5HOCyY,154720,160239,was like hilariously bad  yeah because the market just tanked
dOyrx5HOCyY,160239,165920,which is great to be very clear yeah  great for gamers not great for intel  necessarily
dOyrx5HOCyY,165920,173599,overall performance for the entry-level  alchemist gpu looks like the gtx 1650
dOyrx5HOCyY,173599,181760,super or radeon rx 6400 in most real  world tests and it's often beaten out by
dOyrx5HOCyY,181760,187519,its competitors now strangely it seems  to perform much better in synthetic
dOyrx5HOCyY,187519,193120,benchmarks  but  unless your name is oh i don't know
dOyrx5HOCyY,193120,199040,kingpin  you probably don't care that much about  synthetic benchmarks and you want to
dOyrx5HOCyY,199040,204080,play actual real games  in what appears to be intel's reviewers
dOyrx5HOCyY,204080,210080,guide the only times that this was not  the case in intel's own internal testing
dOyrx5HOCyY,210080,218560,were  nikara bladepoint  where it beat the 1650 super by 2 fps
dOyrx5HOCyY,218560,223760,and the rx 6400 by 6 fps  and
dOyrx5HOCyY,223760,229920,nizhan  where it got 200 fps across the board i  have never heard of either of those
dOyrx5HOCyY,229920,237360,games you guys will have to forgive me  for  being such an ignorant  ignorant gamer okay so i'm just looking
dOyrx5HOCyY,237360,242959,into this it  nikara or naraka oh naraka sorry excuse  me
dOyrx5HOCyY,242959,250080,bladepoint looks like a very highly  rated game it looks  quite  no it's not that new
dOyrx5HOCyY,250080,256239,i see a naraka bladepoint xbox launch  trailer from one day ago
dOyrx5HOCyY,256239,264320,but then it also says initial release  date august 11th 2021 so i have no idea  but i think uh this is a netease game so
dOyrx5HOCyY,264320,269759,i wouldn't be too surprised if this is  more popular in the market they're  launching the gpu in and i assume that
dOyrx5HOCyY,269759,275680,might be the same with nizan as well  so that might be what's going on i am  kind of wondering if it's performing
dOyrx5HOCyY,275680,282320,well in synthetics but not in games i  wonder if it does well in like research
dOyrx5HOCyY,282320,288080,applications and stuff  i mean i can't say anything that i know
dOyrx5HOCyY,288080,293680,gotcha all i can say is whatever's here  yeah so my drivers tested against the
dOyrx5HOCyY,293680,301520,gtx 1050 ti with their aggregate results  looking like  uh the 1050 ti being about 77
dOyrx5HOCyY,301520,307520,of the a380s performance  that's kind of a yikes
dOyrx5HOCyY,307520,314080,the 1650 d6 being about 10  faster than the 8th 380 and the rx 6400
dOyrx5HOCyY,314080,321600,being about 10 faster now we should take  early results with a grain of salt  sort of because the fact that intel's
dOyrx5HOCyY,321600,329759,own reviewers guide their own guidance  materials seem to suggest that  performance is going to be terrible
dOyrx5HOCyY,329759,335520,um  would add a lot of credibility  to third-party testing that indicates
dOyrx5HOCyY,335520,341680,performance is going to be terrible yeah  that's fair  however however it should be noted that
dOyrx5HOCyY,341680,348639,the a380 is supposedly the the like the  i3 right like the three is the the basic
dOyrx5HOCyY,348639,355840,the basic tier  part of the arc range so it was never  going to be competitive with you know a
dOyrx5HOCyY,355840,361039,rtx 3080 or anything like that  it's still a disappointing first outing
dOyrx5HOCyY,361039,366720,and honestly i'm a little surprised that  intel is going entry level first given
dOyrx5HOCyY,366720,373840,that the convention for at least the  other two players flagship launch  duopoly is to launch with your flagship
dOyrx5HOCyY,373840,379039,and then follow up actually amd doesn't  really have any kind of method and  honestly nvidia launches with a flagship
dOyrx5HOCyY,379039,384400,but then a little bit later on  launches another card that's better than  it yeah well they're they're both kind
dOyrx5HOCyY,384400,390160,of all over the place but in general in  general it's a big boy card you're  trying to set the tone for your new
dOyrx5HOCyY,390160,397120,generation by launching your flagship  card taking the performance crown  looking like a big dog you know intel
dOyrx5HOCyY,397120,403759,meanwhile is like  hey we have this thing  it's kind of not very good but um yeah
dOyrx5HOCyY,403759,408800,this is like  slightly off topic but what do you think  of the naming scheme
dOyrx5HOCyY,408800,413840,like the alchemist battle mage stuff and  i think it's sick the numbers afterwards
dOyrx5HOCyY,413840,421039,um the numbers are  fine if they really meant anything but  as far as i can tell okay so a is
dOyrx5HOCyY,421039,427199,obviously alchemist yeah right and as  they release further series of gpus it  seems to be fairly straightforward yeah
dOyrx5HOCyY,427199,432319,they're gonna go through the alphabet  yeah it's pretty it's pretty clear where  they're going with that yeah three i dig
dOyrx5HOCyY,432319,438400,it um  what the only thing i don't like about  the three is that it kind of bucks the
dOyrx5HOCyY,438400,444160,rest of the industry's  trend okay uh where the the first number
dOyrx5HOCyY,444160,449199,is the generation i see what intel's  doing where the letter is the generation
dOyrx5HOCyY,449199,455759,and honestly if they maintain this  naming scheme they'll probably have a  more clear nomenclature than amd and
dOyrx5HOCyY,455759,462800,nvidia who just kind of  seem to use that randomly and like skip  random generations and yeah i mean they
dOyrx5HOCyY,462800,469199,they literally have multiple cards amd  has multiple cards with the same four
dOyrx5HOCyY,469199,475520,numbers right like it's it's it's it's  md ma namedness
dOyrx5HOCyY,475520,481840,amd that amd used to do a march madness  promo called march amd-ness yeah yeah so
dOyrx5HOCyY,481840,487520,i was trying to i was trying to figure  out how you would pronounce emptiness  anyway it doesn't matter the point is
dOyrx5HOCyY,487520,493199,that i see where they're going with this  but it's a little bit confusing from a  consumer perspective when we have an
dOyrx5HOCyY,493199,499919,established okay gpu first number is the  tier so now you've got okay no no the
dOyrx5HOCyY,499919,508000,letter is the tier and then we've got  the  the the  next the the next one is sorry the
dOyrx5HOCyY,508000,515599,letters sorry the first number is a  generation right so now we've got the  letter is the generation and then this  next number is what tier of gpu it is
dOyrx5HOCyY,515599,520640,and it used to be it is with the other  guys that the first number is the  generation and the second number is the
dOyrx5HOCyY,520640,526000,the performance tier the performance  class  then it gets a little confusing for me i
dOyrx5HOCyY,526000,531519,mean i haven't seen the entire arc  alchemist lineup um i don't know that
dOyrx5HOCyY,531519,537360,intel has officially announced the intel  arc  alchemist lineup have they officially
dOyrx5HOCyY,537360,542800,announced the whole lineup  these are apparently leaks a350m
dOyrx5HOCyY,542800,549440,hold on do we have just like a slide  okay here we go i'll share my screen  we've got  these are these appear to be all oh my
dOyrx5HOCyY,549440,556560,goodness go away these appear to be  mobile so we've got a350 ma3 7dm
dOyrx5HOCyY,556560,564320,so that all kind of makes sense it's  alchemist it's three tier and then it's  either a 50 or 70 and then you've got
dOyrx5HOCyY,564320,570399,it's pretty typical for these companies  yeah to to leave  an unused digit in case they ever want
dOyrx5HOCyY,570399,576240,to do which is fine you know a an a355  or something along those lines but yeah
dOyrx5HOCyY,576240,582959,the funny thing about that to me anyway  is that more often than not they're  going to end up using a suffix anyway
dOyrx5HOCyY,582959,588800,pro xt  gtg  yeah or both so you're kind of sitting
dOyrx5HOCyY,588800,593839,there going okay well you got to pick a  link  you got to pick a lane which one is it
dOyrx5HOCyY,593839,600399,yeah i like the yeah the numbers part  and i understand what you're saying with  like the leaving the conventions for
dOyrx5HOCyY,600399,606880,gpus and stuff i think there you have a  point there i don't personally really  care too much to be honest i actually
dOyrx5HOCyY,606880,612480,really like the lettering  and i like the names that go along with  the lettering i think it's cool
dOyrx5HOCyY,612480,618000,um i think a lot of stuff  has gotten very serious over the years
dOyrx5HOCyY,618000,623279,um like if you look at even just like  gpu box art  oh man now compared to back in the day
dOyrx5HOCyY,623279,628320,what nvidia's done to gpu box art is it  should be considered a crime prime yeah
dOyrx5HOCyY,628320,633760,there it's all so samey now you guys  know why right it's because nvidia  forces it
dOyrx5HOCyY,633760,639279,they have to approve the box art from  their board partners so you'll you'll  never see like cool box art anymore at
dOyrx5HOCyY,639279,645120,least not in the north american region  there's still some pretty out there like  wacky colorful box art designs in other
dOyrx5HOCyY,645120,651200,regions but they all have to adhere to  nvidia's rules  yeah they're just all so boring and
dOyrx5HOCyY,651200,657040,sterile and like i  ugh i get it but it's it's  i think it's kind of nice to just have
dOyrx5HOCyY,657040,662320,some fun with it a little bit like  alchemist battle mage like that's cool  yeah i don't know i'm sure
dOyrx5HOCyY,662320,667920,why not and then i i like  i like that they're just going along the  alphabet because yeah it's really clear
dOyrx5HOCyY,667920,673120,it's clear within  intel's own stack i do i do understand  your point of deviating from the other
dOyrx5HOCyY,673120,678720,one i wonder how far in advance they  thought did they did they figure out the  entire alphabet or are they gonna be
dOyrx5HOCyY,678720,684079,like google and sort of realize at some  point okay we're running out of we're  running out of desserts here ladies and
dOyrx5HOCyY,684079,690959,gentlemen  what are we gonna do we're okay okay new  plan new plan we invented dessert
dOyrx5HOCyY,690959,697200,then we named our next android after you  know what  we're going back to just numbers
dOyrx5HOCyY,697200,702640,guy i don't i don't know  i i  feel like intel would have planned it
dOyrx5HOCyY,702640,708079,all out i feel like that would be an  intel move  i feel like i might have said something
dOyrx5HOCyY,708079,713920,like that until back when intel  transitioned their xeon branding to this  whole
dOyrx5HOCyY,713920,721519,gold silver bronze platinum nonsense  that means absolutely  nothing with respect to performance or
dOyrx5HOCyY,721519,728160,the application that that particular  chip is intended for so no luke i really  do not think they thought it out i had i
dOyrx5HOCyY,728160,734079,had this thought like a while ago it  wasn't like i mean like a couple weeks  ago of like you know like we dog on
dOyrx5HOCyY,734079,739200,companies for like bad naming schemes  all the time i should make sure that  like  i i
dOyrx5HOCyY,739200,744480,say good things about the next one  that's actually good and then  then you bring that up yeah no it's
dOyrx5HOCyY,744480,750079,pretty so that was horrible it was  pretty rough that was a complete failure  it was pretty rough
dOyrx5HOCyY,750079,756800,it was trash i mean should we talk about  the core two duo  and then the core two quad is it two or
dOyrx5HOCyY,756800,762079,is it four come on guys  admittedly that was a while ago now
dOyrx5HOCyY,762079,768160,that's that's pretty old but yeah  anyways  it's looking like it's gonna be pretty
dOyrx5HOCyY,768160,775200,rough there are still ways that intel  could redeem themselves if they're super  useful outside of gaming then hey maybe
dOyrx5HOCyY,775200,781120,that's uh that's part of the value  proposition  if their power consumption is extremely
dOyrx5HOCyY,781120,787920,low maybe that's part of the value  proposition  we also haven't seen their sick cards
dOyrx5HOCyY,787920,794160,yeah like if these are competing with  like 50  series cards  like these aren't a lot of the cards
dOyrx5HOCyY,794160,799680,that people would be buying to really  push for gaming anyways so  we'll have to see until they uh we'll
dOyrx5HOCyY,799680,804880,have to see when they bring their big  stuff out and to be fair i don't think  that i could call this like a
dOyrx5HOCyY,804880,810720,disappointment because i don't think  anyone thought they were going to come  out swinging super hard either i mean i
dOyrx5HOCyY,810720,817200,think a lot of people were hoping hoping  for it yeah especially fair enough  during the shortage when gpu pricing was
dOyrx5HOCyY,817200,822560,just  pushing graph pushing gaming out of  reach yeah for
dOyrx5HOCyY,822560,827839,i mean a majority of people you see  gaming was legitimately out of reach for  a lot of people i i had communications
dOyrx5HOCyY,827839,835519,with a bunch of people over the last  couple of years that were like yeah i  mean if my computer dies i'm just done  yeah it's like yeah that's fair yeah for
dOyrx5HOCyY,835519,840839,real just too expensive unlike you they  have to pay for hardware luke yeah no  problem dude i still remember that
dOyrx5HOCyY,840839,847040,conversation it was a great conversation  do you even remember that conversation  no so one time back when we were still
dOyrx5HOCyY,847040,854000,working at ncx um  you were nervous about something to do  with the business and stuff um and you
dOyrx5HOCyY,854000,859600,were talking to me about my compensation  because my compensation was ridiculous  because i was getting paid below minimum
dOyrx5HOCyY,859600,866639,wage at the time yeah and you're right  cix yeah yeah and you were like all i  can say is i'll make an agreement if you
dOyrx5HOCyY,866639,872000,keep working with me  in whatever capacity i'll always make  sure you have a like a sick gaming
dOyrx5HOCyY,872000,878399,machine  you did clarify that it's going to be  not as good as yours
dOyrx5HOCyY,883199,889279,you made sure to get that in there  but you like i'll always make sure you  have a computer and i was like cool i'm
dOyrx5HOCyY,889279,894720,gonna hold you to that and yeah every  once in a while i bring it up it's great  well i mean i forgot about it and i've
dOyrx5HOCyY,894720,900800,still done it so i guess you know there  you go yep it's been good it's been good
dOyrx5HOCyY,901040,907120,i love these like ancient agreements  they're fantastic yeah man i sure agreed  to a lot of stuff back then
dOyrx5HOCyY,907120,912639,jeez  it's good uh another thing that we know  about arc alchemist is that it's going
dOyrx5HOCyY,912639,918240,to support both av-1 decoding and  encoding  so
dOyrx5HOCyY,918240,924399,it could be the only gpu you can buy  today  that will still be able to keep up in
dOyrx5HOCyY,924399,929600,the in the video transcoding world  five  eight
dOyrx5HOCyY,929600,935519,ten years from now when av1 is prevalent  yeah
dOyrx5HOCyY,935519,940880,not now yeah i mean not now av1 is sort  of not that not super um not super
dOyrx5HOCyY,940880,947199,relevant today yeah  but someday  someday we hope
dOyrx5HOCyY,947199,952240,oh  speaking of someday we hope we uploaded  a video a little while ago talking about
dOyrx5HOCyY,952240,957279,the deplorable state of hdr support on  youtube and i might have some bad news
dOyrx5HOCyY,957279,964000,for you oh  i heard through the grapevine that that  might have ruffled some feathers over at
dOyrx5HOCyY,964000,969120,google and that they might actually be  um paying attention
dOyrx5HOCyY,969120,976320,now  to the problems that have  i mean i this is the kind of that's a  good thing i don't whatever yeah well
dOyrx5HOCyY,976320,982720,i'll get to that oh but it's the kind of  thing that drives me crazy why do you  need a high profile
dOyrx5HOCyY,982720,988079,influencer to complain about something  that is obviously broken
dOyrx5HOCyY,988079,995519,why don't you just see that something is  obviously broken and put it on the  roadmap to fix it and you know i got a
dOyrx5HOCyY,995519,1001279,lot of flack for talking about this in  the context of  what was it i forget it was some other
dOyrx5HOCyY,1001279,1006399,thing on on youtube or so oh oh the  jasco situation i think was it jazz you
dOyrx5HOCyY,1006399,1013199,got flack for that i don't know someone  else the point the point is i got flack  for you know taking this
dOyrx5HOCyY,1013199,1019519,you know why don't you fix things that  are broken position  do you remember what i'm talking about  now no but i just realized why this is
dOyrx5HOCyY,1019519,1027120,bad yeah um  it's coming  but i got a lot of flack for taking that  position and when when we don't have our
dOyrx5HOCyY,1027120,1032798,own house in order we there's things we  do wrong uh there's things that our  development projects could could do
dOyrx5HOCyY,1032798,1040558,better but you got to understand like in  the context right  google has literal armies
dOyrx5HOCyY,1040558,1047280,like  literal armies of developers and they  are sitting working on pointless
dOyrx5HOCyY,1047280,1052320,that nobody asked for when core  functionality is still broken or
dOyrx5HOCyY,1052320,1058400,actively working to remove certain  functionality that's what's frustrating  about it that's what sucks they're
dOyrx5HOCyY,1058400,1063679,running all these experiments for  features no one asked them for when just
dOyrx5HOCyY,1063679,1069360,basic stuff is not working i mean you  want to see something that's a joke  i want to see i i knew the app was going
dOyrx5HOCyY,1069360,1075520,to come up which is why i mentioned the  remove removal of different  functionalities here's a joke this is  great watch this i can create a
dOyrx5HOCyY,1075520,1081679,community post okay look at this i can  put an image pull a text poll i should  write some text i could put a picture
dOyrx5HOCyY,1081679,1087840,but but heaven forbid hold on let's go  to the linus tech tips  how the devil do i just get to the
dOyrx5HOCyY,1087840,1093200,channel from here freaking okay  community post wait what they work now
dOyrx5HOCyY,1093200,1099440,holy crap my community posts are working  okay is that a problem with that phone  hold on this is hilarious yeah yeah it
dOyrx5HOCyY,1099440,1106559,doesn't work on  to my knowledge any foldable phone  hold on let's go ahead let's uh
dOyrx5HOCyY,1106559,1112960,whoa  okay  all right it works hold on can i post a  story  nope still can't do that all right never
dOyrx5HOCyY,1112960,1118400,mind so yeah still can't post stories  i've reported it's been two years it's  been over two years i've reported it
dOyrx5HOCyY,1118400,1125200,many times  as far as i can tell it's just like a  switch they need to flip in the tablet  version of the app but they they don't
dOyrx5HOCyY,1125200,1130720,they they don't do that  where was i going with this ra ah yes  right so they're finally paying
dOyrx5HOCyY,1130720,1136080,attention to hdr which would be amazing  because it is legitimately a better
dOyrx5HOCyY,1136080,1143919,viewing experience when done right there  are still some things they need to fix  for example on android hdr will just
dOyrx5HOCyY,1143919,1150559,join your brightness control  sort of i mean this is pretty funny  uh watch this
dOyrx5HOCyY,1150559,1156640,so i'm gonna pull up an hdr video okay  so you can see if i uh stop so you can
dOyrx5HOCyY,1156640,1163919,see if i do this here i'll do it like  this and go full screen right  okay so it that's clearly very hdr and i
dOyrx5HOCyY,1163919,1170240,go and i try to edit my brightness and  be like no no dog you're not going to be  editing your brightness but but but
dOyrx5HOCyY,1170240,1177600,watch this watch this  it's as simple as going like this  playback doesn't even stop
dOyrx5HOCyY,1177600,1183840,it switches to  an sdr or or a tone-mapped
dOyrx5HOCyY,1183840,1189120,version of the hdr grade and i can  adjust my brightness  okay
dOyrx5HOCyY,1189120,1196720,so  google here's an idea free of charge  if i go to the effort to swipe down and
dOyrx5HOCyY,1196720,1201760,go like this  why don't you just switch it do that  yeah
dOyrx5HOCyY,1201760,1206960,and then have a toggle where i can  switch it back to hdr mode here or or or
dOyrx5HOCyY,1206960,1212960,other idea free of charge let me just  pick not hdr in the quality drop down
dOyrx5HOCyY,1212960,1219360,then it solves it because it would be  really hard for us to  fully commit to hdr and upload all of
dOyrx5HOCyY,1219360,1225440,our videos in hdr  until there's some way that people who  don't want to have their retinas burned
dOyrx5HOCyY,1225440,1231600,off  in the middle of the night when they're  trying to watch in bed  for us to have some way for them to
dOyrx5HOCyY,1231600,1236799,enjoy the content as well it's just  going to be impossible for us to do that
dOyrx5HOCyY,1236799,1242000,uh people are saying hdr yoink's  brightness on ios 2 lol atlinus at luke  um
dOyrx5HOCyY,1242000,1248240,i don't think that was the point  but i'm not sure we'll see whatever he's
dOyrx5HOCyY,1248240,1253760,doing i have no idea  i didn't know this topic was even gonna  be a thing of the show so uh
dOyrx5HOCyY,1253760,1258799,hold on a second i'm pretty sure you're  wrong  here's an hdr video
dOyrx5HOCyY,1258799,1264799,here it is that's definitely very  there is  and there's your brightness control so i
dOyrx5HOCyY,1264799,1272320,don't know what you're talking about oh  yeah nope confirmed no that is not a  thing as usual apple does color better
dOyrx5HOCyY,1272320,1279919,than anyone else because they just care  as far as i can tell like it's it's one  of those things apple has plenty of
dOyrx5HOCyY,1279919,1287840,you guys could do this right but instead  you engineered the wrong solution  color is not one of those things
dOyrx5HOCyY,1287840,1293200,cool all right what's the bad part  well we can't have hdr on youtube and
dOyrx5HOCyY,1293200,1298640,not have it on floatplane yeah i thought  so all right sounds good we've done it  before it's just really rough
dOyrx5HOCyY,1298640,1305440,yeah but i guess we'll try to clean that  up is it like cleanupable  um yes
dOyrx5HOCyY,1305440,1311360,but without hiring a bunch of people  that's the fun part
dOyrx5HOCyY,1311360,1317600,yay  [Music]  okay  i'm technically well i'm done now
dOyrx5HOCyY,1317600,1323120,actually  i'm done the  first stage of back-end developer  interviews we still have to do technical
dOyrx5HOCyY,1323120,1329840,interviews and stuff we're starting next  week um  but yeah so i could i could pluck people
dOyrx5HOCyY,1329840,1334720,from  there it could happen
dOyrx5HOCyY,1334880,1340720,all right what's next  well i think we're gonna have to talk  through this buzzfeed news listen to
dOyrx5HOCyY,1340720,1346559,tick tock listen to us topic oh yeah so  everything that you thought was  happening is happening how did this
dOyrx5HOCyY,1346559,1352480,manage to make it into the dock when we  don't have anything about the nothing  phone in here
dOyrx5HOCyY,1352480,1358000,i actually have not been keeping up with  that so  i don't know maybe we'll let you guys
dOyrx5HOCyY,1358000,1363840,just live talk to us about what's  exciting about the nothing phone and  we'll just we'll pair it back to you you
dOyrx5HOCyY,1363840,1369600,guys will run the wan show in the  meantime  buzzfeed news listen to tick tock listen
dOyrx5HOCyY,1369600,1375840,to us last friday buzzfeed reported that  despite assurances from bite dance that
dOyrx5HOCyY,1375840,1382240,information gathered about users in the  u.s is stored in the u.s  china-based employees have repeatedly
dOyrx5HOCyY,1382240,1387520,accessed non-public data about u.s  tick-tock users
dOyrx5HOCyY,1387520,1395039,what stunning what i can't believe this  is no  no by dance
dOyrx5HOCyY,1395039,1400840,i can't believe it  no one would have guessed no one saw  this coming we've been
dOyrx5HOCyY,1400840,1405919,blindsided whatever will we do the  leaked audio recorded 80 internal
dOyrx5HOCyY,1405919,1412320,meetings with china-based employees  through last fall to the new year  in one of the recordings a member of
dOyrx5HOCyY,1412320,1419200,tick tock's trust and safety department  is quoted as saying everything is seen  in china
dOyrx5HOCyY,1419200,1426799,what stunning no how would we have  predicted this  how could you i'm sorry sorry sorry
dOyrx5HOCyY,1426799,1431840,brandon comes in and investigates  what's happening
dOyrx5HOCyY,1432240,1438320,it's worth remembering that back in 2019  the us government's like baby monitoring
dOyrx5HOCyY,1438320,1445840,alarm is going  is everything okay here  the u.s government began investigating
dOyrx5HOCyY,1445840,1450960,tick-tock's chinese ownerships uh  national security implications and a
dOyrx5HOCyY,1450960,1457840,year later uh the donald threatened to  ban the app  uh many of the recorded meetings focused
dOyrx5HOCyY,1457840,1463919,on tick tock's response to that threat  and their  project texas which would redirect
dOyrx5HOCyY,1463919,1468960,protected data away from china  uh bite dance is negotiating a contract
dOyrx5HOCyY,1468960,1475360,with oracle to hold americans data in  texas but  what that protected data is is still
dOyrx5HOCyY,1475360,1483200,being negotiated the recordings indicate  it would not include public data so  profiles posts etc
dOyrx5HOCyY,1483200,1489600,discussion question thank you jonathan  horst how should countries regulate  foreign social media platforms like tick
dOyrx5HOCyY,1489600,1496400,tock or even facebook  uh what sort of impact could substantive  geographical data regulations have on
dOyrx5HOCyY,1496400,1501600,the internet  massive ones i mean
dOyrx5HOCyY,1501600,1507360,basically the the global internet as we  know it could
dOyrx5HOCyY,1507360,1512880,pretty much cease to exist i mean we're  already seeing this happen this already  exists
dOyrx5HOCyY,1512880,1517919,uh countries with essentially closed  internet borders their own their own i
dOyrx5HOCyY,1517919,1523120,mean would you call it an intranet at  that point i mean on that scale i guess  it's still an
dOyrx5HOCyY,1523120,1530000,internet yeah  um  yeah i
dOyrx5HOCyY,1530159,1537440,oh  there's there's massive substantial  uh impacts from from doing this type of
dOyrx5HOCyY,1537440,1543600,stuff i think it's inevitable at this  point personally i think it's going to  happen yeah
dOyrx5HOCyY,1543600,1549279,yeah  i don't know man i think that users will  rebel i think that much like in china
dOyrx5HOCyY,1549279,1554320,where vpn is just considered  if you're willing to run the risk anyway
dOyrx5HOCyY,1554320,1562000,just  part of life  i think you'll just see people vpn their  ways out to you know watch the bbc or
dOyrx5HOCyY,1562000,1568720,participate on but i think there's going  to be some amount of  uh effort to start kind of
dOyrx5HOCyY,1568720,1574240,setting up fences uh because  i think i think like if we if we look at
dOyrx5HOCyY,1574240,1580000,the the the war in ukraine right now  yeah one of the most immediate responses  that happened
dOyrx5HOCyY,1580000,1587039,um against russia was this just volley  of  cyber attacks into russia some coming
dOyrx5HOCyY,1587039,1592720,back out for sure but like it was  definitely mostly going into russia yeah  um  and
dOyrx5HOCyY,1592720,1600080,one of the immediate threats that people  were concerned about coming out of  russia uh was kaspersky right yeah
dOyrx5HOCyY,1600080,1606320,russian developed antivirus software um  people immediately got very suspicious
dOyrx5HOCyY,1606320,1612720,of that that's going to ramp up moving  forward if i was a betting man right um
dOyrx5HOCyY,1612720,1618320,and and softwares and services and stuff  developed in different countries that  start becoming antagonistic with each
dOyrx5HOCyY,1618320,1624320,other whether that antagonistic nature  becomes war or not yeah um i i think
dOyrx5HOCyY,1624320,1629919,it's kind of irrelevant like we're  seeing this with china and the us right  now over tick tock right they're not at
dOyrx5HOCyY,1629919,1635520,war  but they're not exactly friends right  and they're getting highly concerned
dOyrx5HOCyY,1635520,1641520,about data and people using each other's  applications and stuff like that and  sure china has the firewall up
dOyrx5HOCyY,1641520,1646880,but  countries that have more open  policies and standards when it comes to
dOyrx5HOCyY,1646880,1653120,the internet don't  but i don't necessarily think that's  going to survive i'm not saying it it
dOyrx5HOCyY,1653120,1659360,should die off or it should survive i'm  not saying anything like that i just i  don't think it's going to survive that's  all
dOyrx5HOCyY,1659360,1665600,yeah kaspersky is currently banned in  the u.s i think stuff like that is going  to continue i think it's going to keep
dOyrx5HOCyY,1665600,1671200,going floatplane chat suggests can  country area network
dOyrx5HOCyY,1671600,1678480,yes we can oh boy um  yeah and i mean we're seeing like mini
dOyrx5HOCyY,1678480,1683520,versions of it right um like government  and education institutions in
dOyrx5HOCyY,1683520,1689840,canada  um have to work with  applications that store data in canada
dOyrx5HOCyY,1689840,1695440,right have to  um which is very difficult for small  startups
dOyrx5HOCyY,1695440,1701440,because uh having like data silos and  every single country you want to  sell your software in
dOyrx5HOCyY,1701440,1707440,can be difficult and expensive oh yeah  it would cost a fortune yeah so like  it's it's very difficult it's one of the
dOyrx5HOCyY,1707440,1713279,ways that like  during the pandemic when a lot of things  went remote  teams like blew up
dOyrx5HOCyY,1713279,1719440,yeah because teams has this ability to  have data silos in countries they had  that already because there was already
dOyrx5HOCyY,1719440,1725679,these regulations in place just a lot of  places didn't really care or use it way  too much but then when when remote work
dOyrx5HOCyY,1725679,1731120,exploded  teams was already very well positioned  to do that right um and certain other
dOyrx5HOCyY,1731120,1737120,companies that didn't have that  capability sort of fell off a little bit  or at least didn't have the same gain
dOyrx5HOCyY,1737120,1742640,that companies that did have that  capability had  um  yeah it's interesting
dOyrx5HOCyY,1742640,1748000,it's interesting  cyber security is like a huge deal and
dOyrx5HOCyY,1748000,1754480,i think countries are gonna start  getting more and more concerned about it  moving forward you know what else is a  huge deal our sponsors
dOyrx5HOCyY,1754480,1759600,um i was going to actually get to the  store ltte store.  we have
dOyrx5HOCyY,1759600,1765200,some new stuff to announce a lot of new  stuff actually a lot of a lot of new  stuff
dOyrx5HOCyY,1765200,1771360,the processor hoodie is getting a  reprint alongside
dOyrx5HOCyY,1771840,1779200,the hard drive hoodie  [Music]  [Applause]  this is a kind of fun  retro inspired design
dOyrx5HOCyY,1779200,1784880,honestly i think that no offense to our  team i think the color grade on this one
dOyrx5HOCyY,1784880,1791520,is not ideal it's not as you know what  it looks better on that monitor maybe  it's just this monitor okay well either
dOyrx5HOCyY,1791520,1798799,way it's like a very neon pink  and like a very vibrant green it's a
dOyrx5HOCyY,1798799,1804240,kind of very 90s  inspired like uh blown-up hard drive
dOyrx5HOCyY,1804240,1810159,design on the back and then we are also  doing a reprint in a kind of similarly
dOyrx5HOCyY,1810159,1815600,vibrant colorway of the processor hoodie  these are both done on our own blank
dOyrx5HOCyY,1815600,1822480,hoodies so they have like the french  terry interior  really nice really comfortable
dOyrx5HOCyY,1822480,1829360,both of these are print to order so if  you order it it'll take a couple of  weeks while we print them short circuit
dOyrx5HOCyY,1829360,1835120,short circuit hoodie is in stock those  ones ship immediately assuming you don't  have anything else that is print to
dOyrx5HOCyY,1835120,1841679,order or backordered on your order and  we are launching not one not two
dOyrx5HOCyY,1841679,1847520,notebook designs  that's right  notebooks check it out
dOyrx5HOCyY,1847520,1852880,so the ltt logo one that luke has there  let's go ahead and oh we'll go to loot

dOyrx5HOCyY,1866159,1871360,gifs this is something that was pushed  really hard by sarah
dOyrx5HOCyY,1871360,1878960,so it's uh she's she's really into  actual paper this one's kind of the the  rgb ltt logo design
dOyrx5HOCyY,1878960,1884480,uh if you wanna i don't know like flip  through it it's it's  i mean it's paper all right you have the
dOyrx5HOCyY,1884480,1890960,your different rgb like a little page  savers yep  um it's lined
dOyrx5HOCyY,1890960,1896480,there's a lot of pages i find a lot of  notebooks don't come with this many  pages how there's like 234 pages or
dOyrx5HOCyY,1896480,1901519,something uh yes 234 numbered pages four  index pages three page markers
dOyrx5HOCyY,1901519,1906960,and it's 100 gsm lined white paper  this one though is my personal favorite
dOyrx5HOCyY,1906960,1912960,i'll get you to open up this one okay  this is the modern paper notebook
dOyrx5HOCyY,1912960,1918080,what makes it modern hold on you got to  show them the front you got to show them  the front
dOyrx5HOCyY,1918080,1924799,oh yes very modern  much electronic there we go i had to  cash it in the light properly
dOyrx5HOCyY,1924799,1929840,sarah is also a huge fan of spot gloss  so if you ever see spot gloss on our
dOyrx5HOCyY,1929840,1936559,packaging you'll know that she advocated  for it  ah whatever i'm ripping it sorry no
dOyrx5HOCyY,1936559,1943440,you're good you're good it's the paper  paper the paper was made to be ripped  okay  okay so if i take the little cover off
dOyrx5HOCyY,1943440,1948559,of it  you can see hopefully you have to catch  some light again yeah you're gonna have
dOyrx5HOCyY,1948559,1955679,to work pretty hard to catch that one uh  it's sort of showing up i swear to you  in person it's pretty obvious it's very
dOyrx5HOCyY,1955679,1961840,obvious because it's uh it's like it's  embossed  yeah yeah there we go um but you can  clearly see there's even like the power
dOyrx5HOCyY,1961840,1967279,buttons and stuff as if it's a table  hold on i'll just switch to my screen  here so you guys can see on the back
dOyrx5HOCyY,1967279,1972399,we've got the logo the camera  uh on the front you can see the that's
dOyrx5HOCyY,1972399,1979840,nice the power button or lock button or  whatever else this one's this one's like  uh like a matte finish
dOyrx5HOCyY,1979840,1985360,there you go looks a little something  like that hold on i'm going back to the  loop cam  oh i'm trying yeah so this one like the
dOyrx5HOCyY,1985360,1990480,pages on the inside the the lines and  stuff are oh no okay so once you get to  the pages that you write on like the
dOyrx5HOCyY,1990480,1996960,standard pages the lines are black but  on the index they're orange but they  still have  they still have the yeah
dOyrx5HOCyY,1996960,2002159,the little tablet markings on them oh  man you guys it's kind of hard to see in  that camera yeah
dOyrx5HOCyY,2002159,2007679,it's very obvious in person yeah wow you  really like it looks like i'm holding up  a blank piece yeah it gets washed out by
dOyrx5HOCyY,2007679,2012799,the light up emperor's new clothes no i  swear there's a there's a tablet in here  okay and this one has the three ribbons
dOyrx5HOCyY,2012799,2018720,as well but they're like ltt colors yeah  they're gray black and orange yeah  that's cool so we've got two different

dOyrx5HOCyY,2098480,2103520,and the tablet notebook the little  battery symbol goes down as you progress
dOyrx5HOCyY,2103520,2109440,through the notebook shut up it does  really does it  oh that's hilarious
dOyrx5HOCyY,2110880,2116240,oh my it totally does  whoops whoops that's gonna be impossible
dOyrx5HOCyY,2116240,2121440,to show there we go  it's just that in the corner oh yeah  okay very cute but yes that's gonna be
dOyrx5HOCyY,2121440,2126640,impossible to show yeah uh okay here's  the yeah there you go that's what it
dOyrx5HOCyY,2126640,2132079,looks like yeah  that's the the vibrant version  that that's what it actually looks like
dOyrx5HOCyY,2132079,2139119,in person so  all right so lots of stuff if you guys  are thinking  hey i'll just wait and i'll pick up one
dOyrx5HOCyY,2139119,2144720,of those stealth hoodies later i would  advise you not to do that we sent out a
dOyrx5HOCyY,2144720,2152000,tweet yesterday so you're probably  sitting there going it's okay they've  got 1800 units in stock we sent one
dOyrx5HOCyY,2152000,2158560,tweet yesterday and that's how many we  sold  oh wow okay so is that is it 1800 minus
dOyrx5HOCyY,2158560,2164800,that  okay so there's nowhere close to 1800  left no so we sold 500 yesterday
dOyrx5HOCyY,2164800,2170880,and so far today as far as i can tell  with no additional promo  um
dOyrx5HOCyY,2170880,2178720,unless someone picked them up in the  last another 330 are already gone so  it's 1800 minus almost 800. so
dOyrx5HOCyY,2178720,2184880,if you want to get one now's the time to  get it  let's move on to another topic shall we
dOyrx5HOCyY,2184880,2191359,yeah yeah yeah  oh do we really have to talk about the  voice cloning feature
dOyrx5HOCyY,2191359,2196880,from amazon alexa  oh  this is really uncomfortable this is for
dOyrx5HOCyY,2196880,2203359,me  very creepy i do not like it uh do you  want to not talk about it i can fire
dOyrx5HOCyY,2203359,2210560,through it if you want yeah well no i'll  talk about it i just don't like it yeah  it's weird okay so new alexa
dOyrx5HOCyY,2210560,2216240,voice cloning feature was uh  shown off at a june 22nd conference in
dOyrx5HOCyY,2216240,2221359,las vegas uh  i think it sounds like you have to cue
dOyrx5HOCyY,2221359,2226640,it like you have to ask for the voice in  your in your request so as an example uh
dOyrx5HOCyY,2226640,2232560,there's a child asking alexa can grandma  finish reading me the wizard of oz
dOyrx5HOCyY,2232560,2237920,the device confirmed as alexa then swift  switched to a different voice
dOyrx5HOCyY,2237920,2244000,the alexa team apparently developed a  model that allows its voice assistant to  produce a high quality voice with less
dOyrx5HOCyY,2244000,2248079,than one minute of recorded audio
dOyrx5HOCyY,2249520,2257040,creepy  creepy i mean with all the  it was what
dOyrx5HOCyY,2257040,2264560,two years ago that we did that video  where we we deep faked me  and used an ai to to
dOyrx5HOCyY,2264560,2273119,create a voice print and and had it host  the video  okay when we did that there was a whole
dOyrx5HOCyY,2273119,2280320,consent process  i had to i had to sign that they were  allowed to use my voice in that way like
dOyrx5HOCyY,2280320,2285440,there was a there was a lot of concern  about the way that technology like this
dOyrx5HOCyY,2285440,2290720,might be used  and now it's just a feature in amazon  alexa
dOyrx5HOCyY,2290720,2297520,how did we go get from here to here i  think there's huge issues with like um  not to like go down a dark path but i
dOyrx5HOCyY,2297520,2302720,think there's huge issues in regards to  uh like obsessions and like stalker
dOyrx5HOCyY,2302720,2310079,mentality stuff yeah i didn't even think  of that it doesn't it's one minute of  any audio and then they can reproduce
dOyrx5HOCyY,2310079,2316880,whatever from it right so if you want to  be super creepy with your favorite  streamer can i have luke read my fan
dOyrx5HOCyY,2316880,2323680,fiction you could have them read you  like think think about what it could  read you right this this says in here uh
dOyrx5HOCyY,2323680,2330240,finished reading me the wizard of oz  there's probably um forms of like  erotica books that you could have it
dOyrx5HOCyY,2330240,2335760,read you and you could probably have it  read you those books in someone's voice  that you don't necessarily have
dOyrx5HOCyY,2335760,2342800,permission to use  i don't know that for sure i don't know  that alexa will this is a lot of us  don't even swear so i i don't know maybe
dOyrx5HOCyY,2342800,2348880,not maybe it's kind of a prude i i don't  use alexa but either way like it doesn't  have to be something like that right
dOyrx5HOCyY,2348880,2357460,like it could be an innocent thing i was  just going  as far as i basically could with it  alexa have grandma read me my erotica
dOyrx5HOCyY,2357460,2365040,[Laughter]  but seriously  it's creepy it's weird we're  commercializing deep fakes of voices
dOyrx5HOCyY,2365040,2371680,that is literally what's happening  like what if i what if i don't consent  to this what if i'm not alive anymore to
dOyrx5HOCyY,2371680,2376960,consent to this  i'm like how would how would consent to
dOyrx5HOCyY,2376960,2383520,this worth work what you have to say  yes you can use my voice like that's
dOyrx5HOCyY,2383520,2389200,probably not that hard to  get with a different version of the deep  fake right like yeah i mean nicholas uh
dOyrx5HOCyY,2389200,2394320,nicholas plouffe points out  even if we ignore the security  implications i mean that's not even
dOyrx5HOCyY,2394320,2399920,where i went first i mean let's talk  about the security implications what if  you're using this
dOyrx5HOCyY,2399920,2406160,to  authorize something that's voice printed  i mean  voice recognition's not
dOyrx5HOCyY,2406160,2413520,it's not that great still  you know there's a lot of leeway in the  voice recognition models to allow for
dOyrx5HOCyY,2413520,2418960,that you're going to sound but you might  have a cold right yeah you might sound  really different from day to day
dOyrx5HOCyY,2418960,2426160,so  it  being played by a speaker versus coming  out of your your your voice face hole
dOyrx5HOCyY,2426160,2432079,i don't see how they would necessarily  be able to tell the difference i mean  we've seen we've seen facial recognition
dOyrx5HOCyY,2432079,2439280,security measures on mobile devices be  fooled by simple flat photos in the past
dOyrx5HOCyY,2439280,2445839,people are pointing out that uh if it is  verbal consent that you have to give to  it i just gave everyone a recording of
dOyrx5HOCyY,2445839,2453640,me giving verbal consent uh so there you  go  i mean i'm not saying hitler was right
dOyrx5HOCyY,2454880,2462079,nice now there's a that was a recording  of that too  perfect  well that's just that's okay i just this
dOyrx5HOCyY,2462079,2468000,is this is maximum creepy it's a it's a  meme okay it's a yeah it's a meme yeah  yeah oh i didn't even realize we had to
dOyrx5HOCyY,2468000,2473920,address that but that probably makes  sense you know some people might not  have known yeah totally that's a good  idea um
dOyrx5HOCyY,2473920,2481520,in australia we have voice  authentication for government services  says jack of gamers yeah that's  terrifying that's terrifying
dOyrx5HOCyY,2481520,2488160,because you can  you can cue up commands right  like you can tell
dOyrx5HOCyY,2488160,2494640,uh these various devices whether it's  alexa or google home or whatever to say  a phrase when you do something right
dOyrx5HOCyY,2494640,2500480,yeah  so you'd be like  uh so and so say the thing and then they
dOyrx5HOCyY,2500480,2505279,would like say a specific queue of words  most likely
dOyrx5HOCyY,2506400,2512240,nub pub over on twitch says they're  already running into huge postmortem  consent issues in the film industry
dOyrx5HOCyY,2512240,2518240,yup  yeah a little bit  and you know you look at how little
dOyrx5HOCyY,2518240,2525200,protection  uh  you know uh oh musicians that's another  big one those like holo holographic
dOyrx5HOCyY,2525200,2531760,concerts and stuff you look at how  little respect is being given to the  wishes of musicians
dOyrx5HOCyY,2531760,2540000,and those are celebrities those are  people with money whose estates might  actually have the power to sue over this
dOyrx5HOCyY,2540000,2546319,you know  as for everyone else  good luck  iceberg and floodplain chat says the
dOyrx5HOCyY,2546319,2552400,social engineering potential is also  scary that's what we're saying that's  literally what we're saying oh i was  even i was i hadn't even gotten there
dOyrx5HOCyY,2552400,2557440,yet i was still just talking about  fooling and like uh uh an automated
dOyrx5HOCyY,2557440,2565599,thing yeah an automated system yeah no  no no no yeah there's a whole other  level of fooling actual people and to be
dOyrx5HOCyY,2565599,2572160,clear all of that is possible  without this this just takes the
dOyrx5HOCyY,2572160,2578800,like level of access to everyone instead  of anyone who can afford a 99 echo dot
dOyrx5HOCyY,2578800,2585040,or however much an echo dot or like came  free with your phone and if you're  sitting there going well the model
dOyrx5HOCyY,2585040,2590960,couldn't possibly be that convincing or  there might be a long delay as they're  using it to try to trick someone or
dOyrx5HOCyY,2590960,2597680,whatever else let me just say this  all of those message me on telegram or
dOyrx5HOCyY,2597680,2603119,whatsapp comments on youtube right it  wouldn't be those wouldn't exist if they
dOyrx5HOCyY,2603119,2608800,didn't work  and so  there is a significant portion of the
dOyrx5HOCyY,2608800,2614640,population that whether it's a lack of  tech savvy or whether it's something
dOyrx5HOCyY,2614640,2620480,else  does not  smell that as suspicious right so if
dOyrx5HOCyY,2620480,2625920,someone's voice sounds a little off i  mean all they have to do is say sorry  i'm
dOyrx5HOCyY,2625920,2632800,i have a recording that says sorry i  have a bit of a cold not quite feeling  like myself
dOyrx5HOCyY,2632800,2639280,and immediately our our human monkey  brain goes  okay that's a normal thing to say and
dOyrx5HOCyY,2639280,2645920,everything that is abnormal is now  normal  people aren't going to be ready for this
dOyrx5HOCyY,2645920,2652079,our authentication systems are not even  remotely close to ready for this type of  stuff  um
dOyrx5HOCyY,2652079,2660319,anthony's anthony's typing in here  i don't know if i want to say some of it  just because you know security stuff
dOyrx5HOCyY,2660319,2666079,but he points out some things and like  yeah like even even if even if something  requires video
dOyrx5HOCyY,2666079,2672800,uh it's it says here specifically  um  its voice assistant can produce a high
dOyrx5HOCyY,2672800,2679520,quality voice with less than one minute  of recorded audio so it's it's you can  get a high quality voice even if it
dOyrx5HOCyY,2679520,2685440,requires video you can maybe try to pair  that with a video  uh or you can try to deep fake a video
dOyrx5HOCyY,2685440,2691920,and you just have the voice  think about what the commit level of
dOyrx5HOCyY,2691920,2697359,which whoever and no offense if you work  in this kind of a job but
dOyrx5HOCyY,2697359,2702839,the kind of like drone state that  someone would have to be in just
dOyrx5HOCyY,2702839,2708800,reviewing voice video like voice  like video authentication stuff
dOyrx5HOCyY,2708800,2714000,endlessly day after day after day  are they gonna notice if it's not quite
dOyrx5HOCyY,2714000,2719839,right i mean look at how easily fooled  large percentages of the population have
dOyrx5HOCyY,2719839,2729078,been by deep fakes of political figures  saying things they never said or doing  things they never did yeah
dOyrx5HOCyY,2732400,2738160,terrifying lapse memory asks wouldn't  this fall a foul of some state's voice  recording laws i don't know maybe
dOyrx5HOCyY,2738160,2744000,not if a user presumably started  recording authorization submits the data  it's not a yeah it's not a recording
dOyrx5HOCyY,2744000,2750560,yeah it's it's generation of something  new  i don't like it what i do like is

dOyrx5HOCyY,3122160,3127440,think has taken the good guy root in the  smart home space as far as i can tell
dOyrx5HOCyY,3127440,3133119,they have pitched me this privately um  but
dOyrx5HOCyY,3133119,3138960,generally  speaking okay calling it project linus i  don't know
dOyrx5HOCyY,3138960,3144880,it's not wrong but it does feel a little  pushy  i'll say i'll say that just through some
dOyrx5HOCyY,3144880,3150160,pressure yeah um  i you know i i definitely would be happy
dOyrx5HOCyY,3150160,3156720,to see them produce a good  motion controlled switch that that is  that's something that i wanted for my
dOyrx5HOCyY,3156720,3162160,house  as for as for whether or not you know  i'm gonna be
dOyrx5HOCyY,3162160,3167680,involved in this project i i've told  them that at this time like i just don't
dOyrx5HOCyY,3167680,3172880,have the bandwidth for it so you know  i'd i'd love to see the product
dOyrx5HOCyY,3172880,3178160,come to light  but i by that time i might have found an  alternate solution anyway like i don't
dOyrx5HOCyY,3178160,3183440,want to wait that long to change to have  light switches that function the way i
dOyrx5HOCyY,3183440,3189040,want in my house oh hey the logo is in  the pitch deck  that's where i'm that's where i'm at on
dOyrx5HOCyY,3189040,3194800,inabeli's project linus as it is  apparently called i mean it's not like i
dOyrx5HOCyY,3194800,3200480,can control the use of the name linus  uh what have you have you opened the pdf
dOyrx5HOCyY,3200480,3206400,there's the linus lock do you know the  linus lock yeah there's a linus bike  yeah there's linus bike like anyone can
dOyrx5HOCyY,3206400,3211520,you know be linus anything they want  right have you opened the pdf no do it
dOyrx5HOCyY,3211520,3217760,oh i i closed the tab already here why  don't you just uh screen share  uh oh
dOyrx5HOCyY,3217760,3223520,yeah  okay well i would prefer they weren't  using our logo
dOyrx5HOCyY,3223520,3228720,um  i don't know if there's like more that
dOyrx5HOCyY,3228720,3235680,said it is my belief that that  particular variant of our logo was  actually created by a community member
dOyrx5HOCyY,3235680,3241200,what am i looking at is that a youtube  thumbnail mockup
dOyrx5HOCyY,3241359,3247599,is that is that what i'm seeing i think  maybe  i'm not really sure like i don't know if  this is yeah
dOyrx5HOCyY,3247599,3253119,yeah i think it is youtube review video  is is what's on there  okay
dOyrx5HOCyY,3253119,3259599,uh  hmm  well  i mean there it is we're we're covering
dOyrx5HOCyY,3259599,3265599,it  um  so i guess mission accomplished in a  valley
dOyrx5HOCyY,3265599,3271200,oh this is a good question the german  polar bear asks will you be making a bid
dOyrx5HOCyY,3271200,3277760,for artesian builds  oh well you don't buy the company right
dOyrx5HOCyY,3277760,3284559,they're they're they're auctioning off i  think they're also auctioning off their  domain and
dOyrx5HOCyY,3284559,3290400,yeah so i will not if we were to start a  pc build company which by the way
dOyrx5HOCyY,3290400,3296480,wouldn't call it that we are not we  would not wish to inherit artesian  bill's
dOyrx5HOCyY,3296480,3304319,legacy in any way shape or form  we would really we would really much  rather just start our own our own
dOyrx5HOCyY,3304319,3311119,company i'm thinking  linus pc co  because oh my goodness i'm completely
dOyrx5HOCyY,3311119,3318079,devoid of any creativity  actually oh  i think we have a name for the lan event
dOyrx5HOCyY,3318079,3324640,yeah okay i think we actually do guys  i'm pitching it i'm pitching it here
dOyrx5HOCyY,3326319,3332079,we hosted a lan event lan event  whale land kind of goes with the
dOyrx5HOCyY,3332079,3339040,vancouver theme also there's some other  potential yeah we can sell super  expensive tickets yeah which is whale
dOyrx5HOCyY,3339040,3346079,land i love that that's great  we gotta do that  i mean if blizzard and all these other
dOyrx5HOCyY,3346079,3351200,companies are dipping into the whale pot  we might as well yeah okay whale lane
dOyrx5HOCyY,3351200,3356559,uh one little comment on the artesian  builds thing as far as my understanding  goes
dOyrx5HOCyY,3356559,3362079,uh they are selling builds that have  been paid for by other people
dOyrx5HOCyY,3362079,3367119,there's there's other people that have  covered this very well oh that artesian
dOyrx5HOCyY,3367119,3374240,i know  just gotta just gotta find the worst way  to do everything um i i have not watched
dOyrx5HOCyY,3374240,3380720,it but uh christopher yee made a video  about um  this whole thing it's probably good i
dOyrx5HOCyY,3380720,3385760,would check that out um  but yeah i just that's like actually the
dOyrx5HOCyY,3385760,3392000,worst as far as my understanding goes  like all the systems they're selling  that are built were paid for by people
dOyrx5HOCyY,3392000,3398880,and then not delivered and are now being  sold again now i think it's not clear at  this time if the proceeds from the
dOyrx5HOCyY,3398880,3404559,auction will be going to pay back  customers seriously doubt it well
dOyrx5HOCyY,3404559,3410880,i mean yeah that's usually not how that  goes but  i'm just i'm just saying we don't know
dOyrx5HOCyY,3410880,3417359,there is still time  there's still time for them to not be  complete scum
dOyrx5HOCyY,3417359,3423680,right  the track record here  not great um no
dOyrx5HOCyY,3423680,3429839,but yeah lapsed memory pitches linus  system designs lsd the reason why they
dOyrx5HOCyY,3429839,3436640,are getting auctioned off versus ship  just how bankruptcy law works yeah  that's what i was going to kind of say  is like you often have to
dOyrx5HOCyY,3436640,3441920,when bankruptcy i don't know enough  about this but as far as my  understanding goes it usually goes to  the big creditors first yeah the problem
dOyrx5HOCyY,3441920,3448960,is that i was going to say the creditors  who are likely to get that money would  be whoever artesian owes money to for
dOyrx5HOCyY,3448960,3455680,the parts that they bought from them  so the little guy ends up getting  screwed over as far as i could tell at
dOyrx5HOCyY,3455680,3463440,the ncix auction there were  customer systems there that presumably  had been paid for yeah
dOyrx5HOCyY,3463440,3468960,oh  yeah the buyers of the builds are at the  bottom of the creditor list exactly yeah  so those people will probably never see
dOyrx5HOCyY,3468960,3474480,that that uh money it's just  it sucks  yeah it really sucks
dOyrx5HOCyY,3474480,3483040,that's another thing if i were to buy  artesian builds i could open myself up  to that liability potentially which i i
dOyrx5HOCyY,3483040,3488960,mean i'm sorry bad situation  but  i don't want to just start shipping
dOyrx5HOCyY,3488960,3494720,gaming computers out of pocket because  some jackass screwed people over that
dOyrx5HOCyY,3494720,3502880,that really wasn't on me it really  wasn't  speaking of things not being on me oh
dOyrx5HOCyY,3502880,3510480,i  managed to brick a linux install of  ubuntu  in less than an hour this week while
dOyrx5HOCyY,3510480,3516240,attempting to film a short circuit i  guess that doesn't beat your previous  record no but this one was
dOyrx5HOCyY,3516240,3521520,professionally installed by someone else  it came
dOyrx5HOCyY,3521520,3526799,pre-installed on a laptop  and i don't know what these guys were
dOyrx5HOCyY,3526799,3532400,thinking but this particular laptop  maker really cool designs by the way  you're not going to want to miss that
dOyrx5HOCyY,3532400,3538400,short circuit video short circuit hoodie  now available uh you're not going to  want to miss that short circuit video
dOyrx5HOCyY,3538400,3543760,um  i don't know what they were thinking  shipping me a laptop with linux
dOyrx5HOCyY,3543760,3549359,pre-installed when they do offer windows  laptops
dOyrx5HOCyY,3549520,3555440,i swear to you  i swear i cross my heart i hope to die i
dOyrx5HOCyY,3555440,3561920,swear to you i didn't nothing i did  nothing but attempt to launch steam
dOyrx5HOCyY,3561920,3567599,and play cs go steam again  [Laughter]  what okay what happened how did it how
dOyrx5HOCyY,3567599,3573599,did you said you break it how how do you  break it do you know well it didn't have
dOyrx5HOCyY,3573599,3579119,gpu drivers okay so i installed drivers  okay
dOyrx5HOCyY,3579119,3585680,and then  even though i had drivers the game was  running on the igpu
dOyrx5HOCyY,3585680,3591359,integrated graphics  so i switched it to high performance  mode
dOyrx5HOCyY,3591359,3598480,this sounds like more than just running  steam but  but okay  i i didn't say i only ran steam i said i
dOyrx5HOCyY,3598480,3605119,ran steam and played cs go okay okay and  yes i wanted more than 11 fps fair is
dOyrx5HOCyY,3605119,3611040,that unreasonable i think not  okay  okay after i switched to maximum
dOyrx5HOCyY,3611040,3616640,performance mode i was prompted for a  restart which is definitely a thing  linux people
dOyrx5HOCyY,3616640,3622160,linux does need to be restarted so many  people were on my case about that no no
dOyrx5HOCyY,3622160,3627680,um like windows um 200 days up to yeah  whatever there's probably some way to do
dOyrx5HOCyY,3627680,3634000,without a restart i'm sure there is but  okay it's probably way more convenient
dOyrx5HOCyY,3634000,3639680,to just restart it  so  i was prompted to restart
dOyrx5HOCyY,3639680,3643838,and it never turned on
dOyrx5HOCyY,3644880,3649119,oh  boy oh no
dOyrx5HOCyY,3651200,3658400,i'd be i'd be interested in seeing what  actually happened jake figures i must  have some kind of aura
dOyrx5HOCyY,3658400,3665599,that i may actually be cursed  yeah  it's just not possible for linux to run
dOyrx5HOCyY,3665599,3670720,properly for me i just break it by  looking at it but being near it you  watched that batman movie when you were
dOyrx5HOCyY,3670720,3677599,a kid and it just like really resonated  with you  that joke's not gonna hit with that many  people
dOyrx5HOCyY,3678319,3684880,anyway  digidude51 asks are there any games you
dOyrx5HOCyY,3684880,3691920,guys have slash will buy during the  steam summer sale or any you'd recommend  people to pick up same summers man i
dOyrx5HOCyY,3691920,3697359,haven't played that many games recently  luke and i were actually just going  through this the other night we managed
dOyrx5HOCyY,3697359,3703760,to both set aside a couple of hours to  game  we both got in front of our computers  and we were like
dOyrx5HOCyY,3703760,3709680,what do you want to play i don't know  what do you want to play hey now don't  start that again
dOyrx5HOCyY,3709680,3716960,we've been here before yeah we settled  on uh divinity original sin two which  we've managed to i mean by the time i
dOyrx5HOCyY,3716960,3723760,got some kind of weird graphical bug  sorted out that was very odd we played  for about an hour yeah we got off the
dOyrx5HOCyY,3723760,3729039,tutorial boat yeah my understanding is  about  this much of
dOyrx5HOCyY,3729039,3734720,the total content of that game yeah so i  guess we're going to be on that for a  while which is exciting because it's
dOyrx5HOCyY,3734720,3740000,actually a super good game  i've definitely had some stuff show up  that i that i have wanted to pick up
dOyrx5HOCyY,3740000,3746640,that is in the steam summer sale what's  this  oh well that sounds like i know what  that is but like what's up with that
dOyrx5HOCyY,3746640,3752000,i can explain  i was talking i think last week this
dOyrx5HOCyY,3752000,3757839,looks like willow packaging does it it  does i don't think it is no no this is  no i mean it's it's common yeah these
dOyrx5HOCyY,3757839,3763440,are standard these these plastic  protective shells i mean it's not  exclusive i just yeah um
dOyrx5HOCyY,3763440,3769440,last week i think it was on wan show i  talked about how  i would love to treat myself to a copy
dOyrx5HOCyY,3769440,3776880,of final fantasy 6 which in north  america was called final fantasy iii for  the super nintendo uh because i no
dOyrx5HOCyY,3776880,3782400,longer have my childhood copy although i  do have my booklet uh the actual game
dOyrx5HOCyY,3782400,3788240,cartridge itself was lost when i moved  from my dad's house to my mom's house  along with all of my other worldly
dOyrx5HOCyY,3788240,3794880,possessions  and someone anonymously without  providing a name or contact information
dOyrx5HOCyY,3794880,3800400,or anything like that  sent me a copy of final fantasy iii so i
dOyrx5HOCyY,3800400,3806720,i did not actually  buy this this puts my super nintendo  collection up to a whopping two one
dOyrx5HOCyY,3806720,3813359,console  two controllers  and super mario rpg and final fantasy vi
dOyrx5HOCyY,3813359,3818640,which are  uh i never actually owned super mario  rpg when i was a kid but this is one of
dOyrx5HOCyY,3818640,3824880,the only i think four or five games that  i owned for super nintendo because back  then you would rent games yeah a lot of
dOyrx5HOCyY,3824880,3829920,the time you'd find out they were  pretty crap actually  and then you would return them to the
dOyrx5HOCyY,3829920,3837359,store having only invested nine dollars  eight dollars or whatever in them so i  think it would be fitting for me to open
dOyrx5HOCyY,3837359,3843520,it on stream and have a look at  i mean the condition i guess  it seems like
dOyrx5HOCyY,3843520,3849599,based on the state of the outer box it  could be a complete inbox it's not like  a mint condition or anything like
dOyrx5HOCyY,3849599,3856240,nothing too crazy but this is if it's if  everything's in here this is worth like  300 bucks it has been loved oh wow yeah
dOyrx5HOCyY,3856240,3862480,i mean that makes sense it's a  incredibly legendary game  uh magitek has been reborn and the end
dOyrx5HOCyY,3862480,3868400,of the world is near i remember as a kid  thinking the design for mog was so cool
dOyrx5HOCyY,3868400,3873760,and i thought this knife was like  the coolest thing i'd ever seen oh
dOyrx5HOCyY,3873760,3881039,whoops wrong one there we go linus cam  this did like this knife going through  as the as the t and fantasy and like
dOyrx5HOCyY,3881039,3887920,oh oh i loved it have you ever seen any  of the  like manual art or anything like that no
dOyrx5HOCyY,3887920,3894640,i never had played this game the the  only final fantasy i had growing up was  on pc it was final fantasy viii
dOyrx5HOCyY,3894640,3900240,the worst and it was like a six disc set  okay it's not the worst one i'm just  being a hater i liked it i enjoyed it
dOyrx5HOCyY,3900240,3905760,but i didn't play the other ones so i  don't know oh wow i don't know if this  is complete complete i don't know if the
dOyrx5HOCyY,3905760,3911119,count is complete it has to have like  the little nintendo you know slip in  there or anything like that
dOyrx5HOCyY,3911119,3916960,but it has the map the map is always my  favorite part i lost this so early on
dOyrx5HOCyY,3916960,3924480,when i was a kid because i just was  always so cool oh  okay the map is not in perfect condition
dOyrx5HOCyY,3924480,3929760,is it two different maps or is it in  half nope the map came apart  um
dOyrx5HOCyY,3929760,3935119,and i guess at this point you're better  off  leaving it ripped than trying to tape it
dOyrx5HOCyY,3935119,3941200,back together i don't i don't know but i  spent so long just looking at this and  it's really good because you gotta
dOyrx5HOCyY,3941200,3946960,remember when you're a kid you're not  allowed to play games all the time right  yeah so
dOyrx5HOCyY,3946960,3953359,when you're not allowed to play games  you just sit and like fantasize about  playing your games  planning playing your game so we got the
dOyrx5HOCyY,3953359,3959200,world of balance on one side world of  ruin on the other side the world of ruin  really was
dOyrx5HOCyY,3959200,3966240,man such a such a weak point for this  game in my opinion  i i feel like on the one hand it what it
dOyrx5HOCyY,3966240,3971359,was trying to do was really cool being  more open-ended and exploratory but
dOyrx5HOCyY,3971359,3977599,because there's a particular order that  you really need to do things in order to  not get your ass kicked
dOyrx5HOCyY,3977599,3984559,and there's not really a ton of of  guidance for that i i just i felt like  it was not a great
dOyrx5HOCyY,3984559,3990640,gaming experience  instruction booklet oh man this takes me
dOyrx5HOCyY,3990640,3996640,back i do have mine  but i haven't looked at it in a long  time man remember when instruction  booklets were cool like this and just
dOyrx5HOCyY,3996640,4004400,full of all this like concept art like  you because you wouldn't know looking at  the sprites that that's what sells celez
dOyrx5HOCyY,4004400,4010880,i don't even know how to pronounce it uh  there's no voice acting right was  supposed to look like you wouldn't know  that you would only know that from
dOyrx5HOCyY,4010880,4018000,looking at at concept art and it's it's  like that's what magitek arma and armor  and tara is supposed to look like okay
dOyrx5HOCyY,4018000,4024319,like it's it's kind of cool because um  yeah sure the graphics are so bad  because they're like sprites or whatever
dOyrx5HOCyY,4024319,4030240,but your imagination runs because you've  seen stuff like this so you start  imagining what other things look like
dOyrx5HOCyY,4030240,4037200,and yeah i don't know yeah it was it was  more akin to reading i'd say  yeah absolutely
dOyrx5HOCyY,4037200,4042319,love it so thank you very much so there  there's a there's like omg stopped
dOyrx5HOCyY,4042319,4048640,touching it i mean guys it's not a it's  not a mint condition copy or anything  like that i don't think i'm i don't
dOyrx5HOCyY,4048640,4056799,think i'm knocking too much off of its  value right now oh besides isn't that  kind of the point i am also a uh
dOyrx5HOCyY,4056799,4062720,very on the side of like you should you  should use the thing  you know i know a lot of people are like
dOyrx5HOCyY,4062720,4068160,no leave it in the box forever never  look at it never do anything with it  like what's the point of it then um
dOyrx5HOCyY,4068160,4074079,there's there's one that is in not i  would say not as good condition with the  same amount of completeness with eight
dOyrx5HOCyY,4074079,4079200,offers on it right now on ebay for 500  canadian
dOyrx5HOCyY,4079200,4084559,so  yeah all right well i'm putting that  back in the enclosure there's certain
dOyrx5HOCyY,4084559,4090559,parts of the box like the corners on  this one is are more worn but then the  other one has like dents that aren't on
dOyrx5HOCyY,4090559,4097278,the corners of your screen sure  um this is one that i'm looking at this  is in the c stands for cad this is in
dOyrx5HOCyY,4097278,4102719,canadian that one's also tested working  i don't know that this one is working i  haven't tried it yet fair
dOyrx5HOCyY,4102719,4108400,but yeah you can see like the even if  it's not working it can be fixed but i  would imagine from a collector
dOyrx5HOCyY,4108400,4114880,perspective if you  if you have to fix it it's maybe worth  less i
dOyrx5HOCyY,4114880,4120480,i don't know if you would even know if  the soldering was done really well yeah  see like a long along the flat parts
dOyrx5HOCyY,4120480,4127440,this one has a little bit more damage as  far as i can tell that one just has  slightly more rewarding corners i don't  know what is worth more or less yeah i'm
dOyrx5HOCyY,4127440,4132480,not an expert when it comes to this  stuff for me it's it's not about uh like
dOyrx5HOCyY,4132480,4138480,it's not the sort of thing i i don't  know maybe i eventually would have  treated myself to one but it's not the  sort of thing that i
dOyrx5HOCyY,4138480,4144159,i'm gonna you know build up a huge  collection of of snes games or anything  like that but it's still
dOyrx5HOCyY,4144159,4149679,i mean it's the kind of thing that i'm  gonna i'm gonna put on my like display  wall um behind where i'm gonna be
dOyrx5HOCyY,4149679,4155120,streaming at the new place so i've got a  bunch of mementos from a bunch of the  stuff that i had in my attic pretty much

dOyrx5HOCyY,4196880,4202640,toaster it's more of a um oh what is it  the
dOyrx5HOCyY,4202640,4207760,uh the user the user accessible parts  anthony would be able to give you the  full technical explanation of it but the
dOyrx5HOCyY,4207760,4215679,the user accessible parts where you save  data to can become corrupted so you have  to there's like an internal battery that
dOyrx5HOCyY,4215679,4220960,integrity of that data yeah and once  that battery dies like it's a matter of  when not if was this they need to be
dOyrx5HOCyY,4220960,4226320,replaced a saved game  game not like a password save game yeah  yeah
dOyrx5HOCyY,4226320,4234080,so it's possible that it needs some help  it's also possible that they oh someone  says there was a letter in the box
dOyrx5HOCyY,4234080,4239600,what  oh  oh
dOyrx5HOCyY,4239600,4246480,uh alc  5440 on floatplane apparently was the  one who sent it and said there was a
dOyrx5HOCyY,4246480,4252320,letter in the box it was just not given  to you  they no logistics specifically told me
dOyrx5HOCyY,4252320,4256880,there was no letter oh so
dOyrx5HOCyY,4257440,4263520,perhaps your letter was a digital  and uh perhaps you could
dOyrx5HOCyY,4263520,4270400,look ctrl c ctrl v  hopefully  um
dOyrx5HOCyY,4270400,4276480,it was holding 3.2 volts when i tested  it oh okay apparently it is uh it is  good to go hey thank you also 5440.
dOyrx5HOCyY,4276480,4282320,appreciate you that's awesome  all right um  yeah
dOyrx5HOCyY,4282320,4289520,so the letter hopefully i get a chance  to read it at some point it's tested it  does work and apparently has saves okay
dOyrx5HOCyY,4289520,4295520,all right cool  those saves are probably passed where i  ever made it to as a kid i couldn't
dOyrx5HOCyY,4295520,4302000,figure out how to beat the floating  continent because i didn't know that you  could cast magic
dOyrx5HOCyY,4302000,4308400,from the  overworld  so i would run out of potions every time
dOyrx5HOCyY,4308400,4315679,oh so like healing i'm assuming yeah so  you could heal between combats okay yeah  yeah i uh i did not know that you could
dOyrx5HOCyY,4315679,4321760,do that because i was a child  [Laughter]  whoops should we do some of these these
dOyrx5HOCyY,4321760,4326880,merch messages yeah yeah we should  uh oh right there was the steam summer

dOyrx5HOCyY,4439440,4446000,games managed to set aside taken care of  i think  yeah  uh benjamin h asks what happened to all
dOyrx5HOCyY,4446000,4451600,the black magic cameras any follow-up  they just  they
dOyrx5HOCyY,4451600,4458560,were too noisy  bulky  um  we had an opportunity to get rid of them
dOyrx5HOCyY,4458560,4465120,when there were camera shortages during  the pandemic which to my understanding  are still not fully resolved so
dOyrx5HOCyY,4465120,4470640,what we decided to do was uh get some  sony cameras for our
dOyrx5HOCyY,4470640,4475920,uh for short circuit which i don't think  we even have all of them yet but get  some sony cameras for short circuit
dOyrx5HOCyY,4475920,4483600,we're using all of our old canon c200s  for all the different views here boom  luke cam boom linus cam boom wide cam
dOyrx5HOCyY,4483600,4491600,and then  that's it so i think we're using fs5s  and oh no fx sorry fx6s sorry fs5 i was
dOyrx5HOCyY,4491600,4497120,thinking different sony cameras fx66s  and then  oh lordy i can't remember the models
dOyrx5HOCyY,4497120,4504000,that's i i don't care anymore but sony  cameras now  ftl is 75 off get it
dOyrx5HOCyY,4504000,4510239,daniel c my wife and i need a new  mattress i know linus did extensive  research and would like to know the  resource resources he used in
dOyrx5HOCyY,4510239,4515679,researching and about his mattress guru  you want to get to that mattress  underground all right mattress
dOyrx5HOCyY,4515679,4521199,underground  what rule of the internet is it where if
dOyrx5HOCyY,4521199,4526640,it is a thing  there's  an a ridiculously unfathomably large
dOyrx5HOCyY,4526640,4532880,community of people who are unimaginably  into that thing okay so that's mattress
dOyrx5HOCyY,4532880,4538800,underground they're super into  mattresses  and you can you can learn what you need  to know there you can find a place to
dOyrx5HOCyY,4538800,4546640,get a good mattress i can't promise  it'll be cheap but what i can promise is  that you will learn a lot
dOyrx5HOCyY,4547600,4554159,joshua caro asks hi linus throughout the  run of ltt has there ever come a time  when the channel got jeopardized as in a
dOyrx5HOCyY,4554159,4560239,strike or warning or something similar  on the channel  or like an all is lost moment uh i would
dOyrx5HOCyY,4560239,4566880,say that  there were some really um scary moments  when youtube was
dOyrx5HOCyY,4566880,4572719,telegraphing that they were not going to  allow third-party brand integration in  videos i mean you guys have seen how
dOyrx5HOCyY,4572719,4579440,does lmg make money we've done that  video a couple of times now that is a  huge portion of our revenue it's a huge
dOyrx5HOCyY,4579440,4586560,part of what's allowed us to hire people  and and build facilities and buy  equipment uh without it we would not be
dOyrx5HOCyY,4586560,4592400,i mean we'd survive we just we would not  have the kind of amazing world-class
dOyrx5HOCyY,4592400,4599840,team that we have today  so that was a really scary moment when  we got uh when we got kicked off of the
dOyrx5HOCyY,4599840,4605280,amazon affiliate program that was a  super scary moment because that was a
dOyrx5HOCyY,4605280,4610560,more significant portion of our revenue  at the time the reason for it is that we  were
dOyrx5HOCyY,4610560,4616880,oh we felt allowed to promote it  nowadays we just  are super quiet about our amazon
dOyrx5HOCyY,4616880,4622480,affiliate links just because we don't  want to get kicked off of it again for  promoting it wrong
dOyrx5HOCyY,4622480,4628719,um  so so there's that  oh man what else what else has been
dOyrx5HOCyY,4628719,4634640,really scary beginning yeah at the very  beginning we were almost out of money  six months in we didn't have
dOyrx5HOCyY,4634640,4640480,you know vc funding or anything like  that yvonne's bank account was literally  our funding
dOyrx5HOCyY,4640480,4645600,and  we never did miss a paycheck we were  never late on a paycheck
dOyrx5HOCyY,4645600,4651679,but it was close  i i even meant uh before that oh
dOyrx5HOCyY,4651679,4658480,almost didn't even get it right yeah  when we almost didn't get the channel  from ncix it was 11th hour it was
dOyrx5HOCyY,4658480,4663920,literally the night of december 31st yes  and lmg was supposed to begin operation
dOyrx5HOCyY,4663920,4670960,i no longer had a job at ncix starting  january 1.  and uh the the owner of ncix had not
dOyrx5HOCyY,4670960,4677040,signed the deal selling the channel to  us yet over  a dispute that admittedly i played a
dOyrx5HOCyY,4677040,4684080,role in  i i had uh effectively bailed out of  school and no longer had a job either
dOyrx5HOCyY,4684080,4690000,um and i think ed was in a similar spot  no ed was just doing an internship with  us he could have gone back to school at
dOyrx5HOCyY,4690000,4695199,the time okay he never did manage to  make it back but  he could have
dOyrx5HOCyY,4695199,4701199,yeah yeah yeah that was that was a tense  moment  yeah you had probably the most on the
dOyrx5HOCyY,4701199,4706560,line out of all of us i did which is  sort of terrifying why on earth did you
dOyrx5HOCyY,4706560,4713440,do that i don't know  it's kind of stupid am i that  charismatic like i don't think so what
dOyrx5HOCyY,4713440,4719520,did you believe in  um  i've actually reflected on this multiple
dOyrx5HOCyY,4719520,4725120,times and tried to figure out like what  the hell i was thinking uh because i i
dOyrx5HOCyY,4725120,4730800,was i was doing really well in school  and then  basically tanked it all
dOyrx5HOCyY,4730800,4736159,to make less than minimum wage for some  weird youtube channel that when i  started if i remember quickly had like
dOyrx5HOCyY,4736159,4742719,60 000 subs um but i mean  i saw the trajectory while we were
dOyrx5HOCyY,4742719,4749840,working there and something that i had  kind of assumed was like yeah it's gonna  be super rough and maybe there isn't
dOyrx5HOCyY,4749840,4755440,money from yvonne to pay for paychecks  but we'll probably figure it out if we  don't get the youtube channel we could
dOyrx5HOCyY,4755440,4763199,start another one  right and like  it would have been slower but i was like
dOyrx5HOCyY,4763199,4769040,i've gone this far  right like this
dOyrx5HOCyY,4769040,4774880,i think a lot of it was yeah  because at the beginning i was just like  oh i want to do this
dOyrx5HOCyY,4774880,4780480,uh and then the four to eight hours that  we had discussed initially became  significantly more than that yeah per
dOyrx5HOCyY,4780480,4787199,week um was the plan that was the  original original plan and then it  became more than 40 hours um but
dOyrx5HOCyY,4787199,4793440,i i i wanted to do it and then i started  noticing my grades were slipping and i  was like okay but this is a potential
dOyrx5HOCyY,4793440,4799679,maybe  career path i'll try to juggle it better  i mean i think both of us like to think
dOyrx5HOCyY,4799679,4804880,we saw web media yeah coming hard yeah  like it
dOyrx5HOCyY,4804880,4807120,uh
dOyrx5HOCyY,4810080,4815120,come on you had to break i was going to  hold it together luke i'm sorry
dOyrx5HOCyY,4815120,4821840,um but yeah no seriously it was like you  could see the path right like it was  pretty clear yeah the growth of not just
dOyrx5HOCyY,4821840,4826638,our channel but the whole black it was  all over everyone's faces
dOyrx5HOCyY,4827520,4833040,justin tv was around like it everything  was really cranking up and it and that's
dOyrx5HOCyY,4833040,4839760,what everyone tells you like that's when  you want to be on the ground floor yes  so it was like yeah this is  uncomfortable but this is also the time
dOyrx5HOCyY,4839760,4849040,in my life to do uncomfortable things so  [Laughter]
dOyrx5HOCyY,4849040,4854320,um  so we made it i think  yeah
dOyrx5HOCyY,4854320,4860159,there's still plenty of time for this to  explode we got to completion yeah we're
dOyrx5HOCyY,4862000,4868320,i mean we're going we're going all the  way in we're in deep right now i've been  very i've been very transparent with you
dOyrx5HOCyY,4868320,4873360,guys about how deeply reinvested yvonne  and i are right now business is
dOyrx5HOCyY,4873360,4878639,throbbing yeah we have uh we have we  have 10 million in debt on the lab more
dOyrx5HOCyY,4878639,4886960,actually i'm rounding okay we're at the  point where you actually round to to  round tens of or tens of millions okay
dOyrx5HOCyY,4886960,4892960,so we're 10 million in on the lab  we are  in debt on the lab and then all of our
dOyrx5HOCyY,4892960,4900000,cash is deployed in inventory for  screwdriver and backpack which is 100  000 units of screwdriver and 40 000
dOyrx5HOCyY,4900000,4906159,units of backpack  so like we are  we're all in again
dOyrx5HOCyY,4906159,4911760,um fortunately if this is anything to go  by the worst case scenario is we can
dOyrx5HOCyY,4911760,4918960,just sell all the screwdrivers and  backpacks at a loss  and will manage to get rid of them  because the velocity on stealth hoodie
dOyrx5HOCyY,4918960,4926080,sales does not appear to be  uh yeah you guys probably didn't have to  go quite to 50 percent
dOyrx5HOCyY,4926080,4932159,you know  i don't know man i  it was it was a thursday afternoon and i
dOyrx5HOCyY,4932159,4937520,was tired  and nick was just taking care of it  or no no wednesday wednesday afternoon
dOyrx5HOCyY,4937520,4944639,it was hump day and i was like  i don't know nick sure yeah okay
dOyrx5HOCyY,4944639,4950320,so we did it we did a thing yeah it is  what it is  look you got to be you got to be kind of
dOyrx5HOCyY,4950320,4956880,wild and crazy sometimes it's like a  three-year-old product you got to get in  there you got to try and we've got new  stuff coming i want to be very upfront
dOyrx5HOCyY,4956880,4962239,about that creative in the business room  yeah exactly
dOyrx5HOCyY,4963760,4970000,jake b asks  huh  really you know you don't have to send  merch messages you can just talk into
dOyrx5HOCyY,4970000,4976480,your mic it's just great merch that i  want  hey lmg i'm an avid biohacker implants
dOyrx5HOCyY,4976480,4983360,and would love to see you guys discuss  the topic possibly in regards to linus's  house  i'm excited for the new apex implant no
dOyrx5HOCyY,4983360,4989360,idea what that is but apparently you're  hoping to use it as a password manager  i've actually wanted to get an rfid chip
dOyrx5HOCyY,4989360,4995120,in my palm for quite some time i hate  pulling out my phone to scan to come  into the building here and stuff like  that i'm
dOyrx5HOCyY,4995120,5000480,i'm i'm into it but we had actually  planned to do a trip down to seattle to
dOyrx5HOCyY,5000480,5007120,a place that does them  right early 2020 and i think you guys  know what probably happened to those
dOyrx5HOCyY,5007120,5013600,plans  i'd do it in 2019 when whenever the  covid pandemic thing happened early 2020
dOyrx5HOCyY,5013600,5019920,so the border was like closed for a year  and a half and we didn't do it but i'm  yeah i'm i'm down
dOyrx5HOCyY,5019920,5027520,yeah i'm in yeah we're a bunch of people  we were just all gonna go down and do it  i remember talking about this yeah  forever ago i i've always been very
dOyrx5HOCyY,5027520,5034880,interested  by the fields of biohacking but have  never  dove into it um i've heard stories of
dOyrx5HOCyY,5034880,5041360,people putting like magnets in their  fingertips so that they can  like basically gain a magnetic sense
dOyrx5HOCyY,5041360,5047760,like they can detect magnetic fields  because it will pull on their fingertips
dOyrx5HOCyY,5047760,5053120,it's kind of spooky at the same time but  i would just play with it over and over
dOyrx5HOCyY,5053120,5059600,and over again endlessly i would just do  i would just do this all day  i i think they're like really weak on
dOyrx5HOCyY,5059600,5065520,purpose but um because  for obvious reasons um but yeah i mean  there's a bunch of really cool stuff in
dOyrx5HOCyY,5065520,5071760,that field just have never actually  committed  scott g my fp8s are doing pretty well
dOyrx5HOCyY,5071760,5076800,because they're my backup pair but my  airpods pros are starting to have a  little bit less battery life less than
dOyrx5HOCyY,5076800,5082000,you'd think because i'm on my third pair  of them because i lost a couple i  thought they'd turn up in the move i was
dOyrx5HOCyY,5082000,5087440,sure they were at my house but they  apparently or  not wow
dOyrx5HOCyY,5087440,5093360,yep  adam what other hand tool if any would  you consider making after the
dOyrx5HOCyY,5093360,5099280,screwdriver i think we'd want to do  really good electronics tools like we'd  want to do
dOyrx5HOCyY,5099280,5105920,you know tweezers and  um  pry tools and things like that like i  could i could definitely see us we
dOyrx5HOCyY,5105920,5111920,wouldn't be i don't think we'd want to  compete  at like a budget price point that's not
dOyrx5HOCyY,5111920,5117440,really our brand i was just going to say  having tweezers that you can like that  aren't super
dOyrx5HOCyY,5117440,5123600,and like kind of annoying to handle  would be sweet yeah just like a really  nice pair you know i it's i mean it's
dOyrx5HOCyY,5123600,5131199,going to come down to pretty much stuff  that i want to be better  i i i hate most of the like needle nose
dOyrx5HOCyY,5131199,5137360,pliers that i've ever used like a really  nice pair of needle nose pliers yeah i'd  be down i'd be down to do something like
dOyrx5HOCyY,5137360,5143920,i i don't know we're gonna see we're  going to see  amber  uh dylan kennedy says airpods pro have
dOyrx5HOCyY,5143920,5149280,find my just use that to track them only  works if they have battery  yeah and if you had them paired to your
dOyrx5HOCyY,5149280,5154400,iphone if i recall correctly because i  was trying to find them recently and i  couldn't figure out how to do it from an  android phone if you didn't have it
dOyrx5HOCyY,5154400,5157520,paired to the iphone
dOyrx5HOCyY,5159600,5165679,do we have any other topics that we  wanted to hit oh  pcie 7.0 was just announced and it's
dOyrx5HOCyY,5165679,5171920,going to be a fast one ladies and  gentlemen although pcie 5 is just  starting to trickle out into the real
dOyrx5HOCyY,5171920,5178000,world the fine folks over at pci sig  have unveiled the specs for the pcie 7.0
dOyrx5HOCyY,5178000,5185199,standard  it's fast  it'll do  512 gigabytes per second
dOyrx5HOCyY,5185199,5191040,eight times the speed of pcie 5.0  really
dOyrx5HOCyY,5191040,5196400,two times what pcie 6 will bring so pcie  6 is quadrupling speed instead of  doubling
dOyrx5HOCyY,5196400,5201840,this is madness of course 512 gigabytes  a second will be for 16x connectors and
dOyrx5HOCyY,5201840,5210000,in real life the performance won't be  that high but what that means is a  single pcie 7.0 lane will give us the
dOyrx5HOCyY,5210000,5215600,same bandwidth as a full-blown pcie gen4  16x slot
dOyrx5HOCyY,5215600,5221600,wow  pcie 5.0 ssds are just starting to come  out with speeds of 13 gigabytes a second
dOyrx5HOCyY,5221600,5227600,so maybe over 100 gigabytes a second  could actually happen on a single ssd i
dOyrx5HOCyY,5227600,5233360,mean nand flash is gonna have to come a  long way  before we're gonna see anything like
dOyrx5HOCyY,5233360,5240320,that but  who knows man yeah anthony writes if you  could get an external gpu adapter like
dOyrx5HOCyY,5240320,5245679,the beast nvme thing to work with pcie  gen 7 that'd be hilarious you could run
dOyrx5HOCyY,5245679,5252239,like a full fat desktop gpu full speed  on your laptop like storage slot or if
dOyrx5HOCyY,5252239,5259520,we saw you know a steam deck of the  future with pcie gen i mean even  gen 5 or gen 6 by that point
dOyrx5HOCyY,5259520,5264719,i worry that these generations of pcie  are not even really going to make their
dOyrx5HOCyY,5264719,5270800,way into the consumer space though  a we don't need it no honestly we really
dOyrx5HOCyY,5270800,5276880,don't need it and b  i have to imagine that the power  requirements just wouldn't make sense
dOyrx5HOCyY,5276880,5282159,particularly for mobile  i mean yeah moore's law blah blah we're  going to see
dOyrx5HOCyY,5282159,5289520,more refined process node technology but  you got to remember guys  as we get more power efficient
dOyrx5HOCyY,5289520,5296880,like gen4 controllers are also going to  get more power efficient so it might  just not make any sense i mean we've
dOyrx5HOCyY,5296880,5304080,already seen multiple mobile platforms  not carry the same pci express  generation compatibility as their
dOyrx5HOCyY,5304080,5309840,desktop counterparts  one of the things too is like by the  time we might need it say we go like far
dOyrx5HOCyY,5309840,5315920,enough out in the future and something  crazy requires that type of stuff uh  there's probably going to be gen
dOyrx5HOCyY,5315920,5321679,whatever the heck way beyond what we're  currently at so yeah i suspect the  consumer space will skip quite a few
dOyrx5HOCyY,5321679,5329520,gremlin injector says linus this will  improve efficiency imagine a cpu that  only needs four pcie lanes
dOyrx5HOCyY,5329520,5336159,i mean i guess we'll see  we'll see that's a good comment actually  are you better off with more lower power
dOyrx5HOCyY,5336159,5342000,lanes or fewer higher power lanes  will consumers revolt when intel an
dOyrx5HOCyY,5342000,5347199,intel or an amd releases a platform that  has fewer lanes than the previous one  because so far that hasn't been the
dOyrx5HOCyY,5347199,5353760,trend  i don't know  uh someone brought up that we have not
dOyrx5HOCyY,5353760,5359280,addressed the responding to critical  topic oh  right
dOyrx5HOCyY,5359280,5365920,that's a whole big thing it's big so oh  uh sam our our audio engineer for labs
dOyrx5HOCyY,5365920,5373679,is off probation now so i can call them  out by name oh and by the way chronicle  uh we also haven't received our 5128 we
dOyrx5HOCyY,5373679,5380000,shot our video with a rental  so  after publishing our head and torso  simulator video chronicle had some
dOyrx5HOCyY,5380000,5386400,thoughts who is critical chronicle is  the man behind in-ear fidelity one of  the most comprehensive iem and headphone
dOyrx5HOCyY,5386400,5392480,databases on the web he's one of the  most prominent creators in the  audiophile community and is well  respected and very knowledgeable his
dOyrx5HOCyY,5392480,5398880,channel is great if you guys want to go  subscribe to him  critical plus um  especially since he had to restart his
dOyrx5HOCyY,5398880,5405280,whole channel after losing it oh youtube  support was apparently useless  his video complements our video quite
dOyrx5HOCyY,5405280,5411520,nicely filling in technical information  gaps in our video that our audience we  felt might not have been interested in
dOyrx5HOCyY,5411520,5419280,since this was an ltt video  not an in-depth deep dive on what could  in the future be a lab-specific channel
dOyrx5HOCyY,5419280,5424800,you got to remember you can't just  publish any old thing you want on any  old random channel and expect it to
dOyrx5HOCyY,5424800,5430080,perform well you have to try to meet the  expectations of your audience regarding
dOyrx5HOCyY,5430080,5435440,our video chronicle said that our  current audio product reviews are kind  of low level
dOyrx5HOCyY,5435440,5440800,that's fair but he thinks we're heading  in the right direction and looks forward  to our development he hopes that our  influence will be good for the headphone
dOyrx5HOCyY,5440800,5447840,industry in general he also thinks we  made the right choice in head and torso  simulator that's good to know because it  wasn't cheap cool
dOyrx5HOCyY,5447840,5453840,he said our hat's video was largely  accurate but a little dumbed down to fit  the mainstream viewer
dOyrx5HOCyY,5453840,5460800,you are right  i cut out so much to at first  okay so first sam cut out things knowing
dOyrx5HOCyY,5460800,5467280,that it was headed to ltt  then adam the writer cut out a bunch of  sam's stuff knowing that it was headed
dOyrx5HOCyY,5467280,5473280,to ltt then i took much of what adam  preserved and cut it out
dOyrx5HOCyY,5473280,5479600,because we were trying to address a more  mainstream audience  so critical  you're right
dOyrx5HOCyY,5479600,5486000,he thinks we could have gone with a more  cost-effective solution but given our  resources and ambitions he understands  our decision yeah we don't want to
dOyrx5HOCyY,5486000,5491120,around like that's just not what labs is  going to be  does have advice and concerns for us
dOyrx5HOCyY,5491120,5497440,don't waste time on certain tests and  measurements that although they might be  a staple of audio  headphone measurements provide little
dOyrx5HOCyY,5497440,5503600,useful information to the user examples  include total harmonic distortion time  domain measurements impulse response
dOyrx5HOCyY,5503600,5509440,waterfall plots etc got it  don't abandon this headphone database  project after a while like some other
dOyrx5HOCyY,5509440,5516000,websites have like headphy.org instead  build a thorough and comprehensive  database of headphones and continuously  update it make sure it's feature-rich
dOyrx5HOCyY,5516000,5523440,and has powerful and flexible comparison  tools and functions  you ready that's the goal that is the  goal but it's going to take well luke's
dOyrx5HOCyY,5523440,5530000,hiring right now ain't he  yeah yeah you sure am  don't publish sound demos
dOyrx5HOCyY,5530000,5537199,interesting where you play samples of  the audio output from each headphone for  users to listen to
dOyrx5HOCyY,5537199,5542960,chronicle says basically it would be  like judging the color accuracy of a tv  while wearing colored glasses so you
dOyrx5HOCyY,5542960,5550000,can't really tell how each headphone  would sound on your head it's only a  relative comparison
dOyrx5HOCyY,5550000,5557040,this contains sam's response which i  have not read yet but i do have my own  thoughts about that i will read sam's  response first we agree that frequency
dOyrx5HOCyY,5557040,5562159,response sound demos are only valid for  relative comparisons and not for  absolute comparisons this makes
dOyrx5HOCyY,5562159,5567360,frequency response sound demos quite  confusing for the uninitiated  uninitiated if we decide to publish
dOyrx5HOCyY,5567360,5572719,frequency response sound demos we will  make sure that their limitations are  very very clear however there are other
dOyrx5HOCyY,5572719,5579120,types of sound demos that can be quite  useful like active noise cancellation or  isolation sound demos as well as leakage
dOyrx5HOCyY,5579120,5585120,and microphone headset sound demos  critical approves of these last few  yeah i mean i think this is something
dOyrx5HOCyY,5585120,5592320,that i'm going to butt heads with the  labs team about  often because i do
dOyrx5HOCyY,5592320,5597679,have it i do have a tendency to  want to at least give people who don't
dOyrx5HOCyY,5597679,5603199,understand technical documentation  something to look at that might tell
dOyrx5HOCyY,5603199,5610000,them  something anything  and some in some cases
dOyrx5HOCyY,5610000,5617520,you can run into a situation where a  product is so  clearly obviously worse than another one
dOyrx5HOCyY,5617520,5625440,that even a recording on a crappy  microphone played through youtube  compression on dollar store earphones
dOyrx5HOCyY,5625440,5631600,will tell you that this one is clearly  better than the other one garbage in  garbage out
dOyrx5HOCyY,5631600,5636719,so  i know that there will be situations
dOyrx5HOCyY,5636719,5643920,where we are going to publish  sound demos for example  fan noise is something where
dOyrx5HOCyY,5643920,5651040,quantitatively you can you can turn it  into a numerical value you can represent  it that way but qualitatively it's very
dOyrx5HOCyY,5651040,5657360,difficult and so as i feel as long as we  have a very consistent way of collecting
dOyrx5HOCyY,5657360,5663520,those sound demos  there's a value to that for the end user
dOyrx5HOCyY,5663520,5669920,is is there so something from  from my side would be like labs is  trying to be as hardcore and objective
dOyrx5HOCyY,5669920,5676719,as it can be is there value to the  not everyone's going to understand this  but like the the like science local
dOyrx5HOCyY,5676719,5683440,science museum i was going to say  science world but  we can apply it to whatever one you have  um you know how you can like walk up and
dOyrx5HOCyY,5683440,5690560,press a button and it like will give you  like a a kid's level  understanding of something like is there
dOyrx5HOCyY,5690560,5695920,value to that like could we give people  audio samples and just have like very  blatant warnings and be like this is not
dOyrx5HOCyY,5695920,5702400,objective  i think that it could be valuable for  things like  um
dOyrx5HOCyY,5702400,5708239,you know this is what more bass heavy a  more bass heavy headphone might sound  like
dOyrx5HOCyY,5708239,5714560,or or if we were to do something like a  guide for how to wear your headphones  properly which is a big deal like if you
dOyrx5HOCyY,5714560,5720560,have a leak in a closed back headphone i  mean good luck getting any bass response  out of it right so
dOyrx5HOCyY,5720560,5726080,if we had something like demos of here's  what your headphones might sound like  when they are not sealed correctly like
dOyrx5HOCyY,5726080,5731679,this or here's what your headphone might  sound like if you're wearing it too far  forward i think something like that
dOyrx5HOCyY,5731679,5736880,could have a ton of value but in that  case you're comparing apples to apples  you're only changing one variable at a
dOyrx5HOCyY,5736880,5742560,time you're also hoping that they're  wearing it properly in the first place  well no because it's relative it is
dOyrx5HOCyY,5742560,5747679,relative  so the recording would still reflect
dOyrx5HOCyY,5747679,5753199,some of those changes  it's just the the recording of wearing  it properly won't sound proper if
dOyrx5HOCyY,5753199,5758480,they're not wearing it properly  uh legits who says linus arguing with
dOyrx5HOCyY,5758480,5765119,the very people he hired because he has  no clue he's talking about is confusing  no you're the only one who's confused  i'm not arguing with them i'm saying
dOyrx5HOCyY,5765119,5771520,that we are definitely going to have to  find  a  middle ground where we are able to
dOyrx5HOCyY,5771520,5777199,represent the differences between  products in a way that  normies can understand
dOyrx5HOCyY,5777199,5784400,and  while also  staying true to our mission which is to
dOyrx5HOCyY,5784400,5790960,provide objective empirical data  there has to be a very very clear line
dOyrx5HOCyY,5790960,5797440,between the two  as well which is going to be interesting  communicating
dOyrx5HOCyY,5797440,5803360,results and things like that is is very  difficult snow skeleton over on  floatplane chat seems to understand a
dOyrx5HOCyY,5803360,5809119,little better and says relative can  still be valuable if you have a  recording of a headset that i know and  like
dOyrx5HOCyY,5809119,5814239,and play the same sounds on a different  set i can get some sense for the  differences based on my knowledge of a
dOyrx5HOCyY,5814239,5819920,previous set yeah  it's not scientific at all and frankly  we wouldn't want you to make a purchase
dOyrx5HOCyY,5819920,5826080,decision based on that i mean we could  even just say that much  it would have to be like super super
dOyrx5HOCyY,5826080,5832159,clear i think disclaiming it um  i think disclaiming it and just saying  this is for
dOyrx5HOCyY,5832159,5837840,you basically go you go psychic on it  you say this is for entertainment  purposes only
dOyrx5HOCyY,5837840,5843600,this is the scientific data this is for  entertainment purposes only i would be  comfortable publishing it
dOyrx5HOCyY,5843600,5849040,um at the end critical jokes that if our  headphone test engineer insists on  publishing sound demos we should fire
dOyrx5HOCyY,5849040,5855679,him i had actually only just read that  now so apparently maybe we should fire  me  um i you know it's one of those things
dOyrx5HOCyY,5855679,5861920,where i understand both the purist point  of view and i also understand the users  who just want that resource
dOyrx5HOCyY,5861920,5869360,whether it's a flawed data point or not  and it feels honestly a lot like arguing  with youtube about the dislike button  they say well it's not a good indicator
dOyrx5HOCyY,5869360,5874960,of video quality and most users don't  rely on it anyway because comments is so  much better blah blah blah blah blah
dOyrx5HOCyY,5874960,5881840,there's so much there's so much uh  there's so much interpretation that  needs to be done in order to utilize
dOyrx5HOCyY,5881840,5887760,this signal that as an end user you  couldn't possibly do it and i'm sitting  here going i can do it just fine and i
dOyrx5HOCyY,5887760,5893440,would like to have it  i'm the end user i'm the customer i said  i want it
dOyrx5HOCyY,5893440,5900719,and so there's a push and there's a pull  right  we have to push what are the right
dOyrx5HOCyY,5900719,5907280,measurements and what are the right  means of representing the differences  between products but users are also
dOyrx5HOCyY,5907280,5912639,going to tell us what resources they  want and it's very clear from chat
dOyrx5HOCyY,5912639,5919199,that they want that resource  and again we can do a lot in regards to
dOyrx5HOCyY,5919199,5924880,segmenting it making it very very clear  like okay this section is for  entertainment purposes only like you
dOyrx5HOCyY,5924880,5931119,said  this is the actual like proper data  dividing it all up
dOyrx5HOCyY,5931119,5936639,yeah  see legits who says i would rather be  presented with hard science scientific
dOyrx5HOCyY,5936639,5942800,data that this headphone is better than  that headphone and let the subjective  part which would be me the subject make  the final decision but it doesn't work
dOyrx5HOCyY,5942800,5948880,that way so again you don't understand  no single headphone is
dOyrx5HOCyY,5948880,5953920,better objectively than another  headphones you also don't have to go
dOyrx5HOCyY,5953920,5959119,through the entertainment only section  you can just read the hard facts section
dOyrx5HOCyY,5959119,5965920,which is true  but the the the thing that i want to  clarify here is that we all are so
dOyrx5HOCyY,5965920,5973440,different our our our physiology is so  different that the best performing  headphone for me is not necessarily the
dOyrx5HOCyY,5973440,5980800,best performing headphone for you this  is something that we did discuss in the  video and the the dummy head
dOyrx5HOCyY,5980800,5985840,is it's an average it's designed based  on an average of a whole bunch of people
dOyrx5HOCyY,5985840,5991199,no one of those individual people was  that average it's it's literally just a
dOyrx5HOCyY,5991199,5998800,a nice to know figure that you're  collecting from it there is no  objectivity here that's the challenge
dOyrx5HOCyY,6002560,6007600,uh note from bell this week's short  circuit will have labs notes in it
dOyrx5HOCyY,6007600,6013920,really  or this weekend's this weekend yeah for  the mercedes eqs we have labs notes on
dOyrx5HOCyY,6013920,6019679,the speaker system so if you want to see  kind of how some of it will be presented  and compared to other products that will
dOyrx5HOCyY,6019679,6023840,be an option  that's fun
dOyrx5HOCyY,6025600,6031760,cool  anyways i i think  uh i haven't watched the video but from  from looking at the the back and forth
dOyrx5HOCyY,6031760,6037040,it sounds like both sides are super  level-headed and there's some really  cool feedback and that's awesome yeah
dOyrx5HOCyY,6037040,6043440,it's actually really exciting to have  like  pinnacle figures of of various  industries
dOyrx5HOCyY,6043440,6048800,stepping up and being excited about us  doing this and and giving advice as well  because like
dOyrx5HOCyY,6048800,6054639,yeah we're not we don't know everything  and we want to make sure that we are  taking the right and we'll make mistakes
dOyrx5HOCyY,6054639,6059920,yeah  joshua says what is the priority for
dOyrx5HOCyY,6059920,6067679,things to be tested in ltt labs  whatever we can do well i've been asked  this a lot internally as well like what
dOyrx5HOCyY,6067679,6074000,are we what are we hiring for and the  answer is we're hiring the best people  and whatever it is that they happen to
dOyrx5HOCyY,6074000,6080239,be experts in  well that's um what we're gonna test  first
dOyrx5HOCyY,6080239,6086800,yeah it's just gonna be that simple so  we found an excellent candidate for  audio uh we have an excellent candidate
dOyrx5HOCyY,6086800,6093280,for keyboards um  we have what else can i announce yet you
dOyrx5HOCyY,6093280,6100080,know what i'm going to leave it there  for now i'll leave it there for now  because those guys are off probation  all right
dOyrx5HOCyY,6101040,6108080,andrew asks how do you like the ubiquity  unifi protect setup in your new house it  looked like you went with two nvrs  instead of an nvr pro why jake set it up
dOyrx5HOCyY,6108080,6114000,that way i believe it was just because  of it being difficult to get our hands  on an nvr pro
dOyrx5HOCyY,6114000,6120239,as for how much i like it it's very very  very very expensive but the benefit is
dOyrx5HOCyY,6120239,6125280,that i'm very unlikely to get rug pulled  later on and have functionality turned
dOyrx5HOCyY,6125280,6131119,off if i refuse to pay for a  subscription service so there's no  ongoing cost i it's it's one time and
dOyrx5HOCyY,6131119,6136400,forget about it also ubiquiti is a great  partner and didn't charge me for it so
dOyrx5HOCyY,6136400,6141600,there wasn't even that drawback but the  image quality is mwah it's so good
dOyrx5HOCyY,6141600,6147360,so good and the app is  getting better it's a lot better now  than it was there's still definitely
dOyrx5HOCyY,6147360,6152480,room for improvement but it's getting so  much better and it's happening at a very
dOyrx5HOCyY,6152480,6158480,reasonable pace a good pace  oh i guess you can read these now that  you've kind of caught up on the incoming
dOyrx5HOCyY,6158480,6163920,merch messages hey bill i did get a bit  of a breather first uh one here is from
dOyrx5HOCyY,6163920,6170320,steve the industry seems to be moving  towards arm processors what do you think  this will do to old games max m1 rosetta
dOyrx5HOCyY,6170320,6177719,works good but history says apple will  axe it what do you think will happen in  the pc space
dOyrx5HOCyY,6178000,6184320,wow  this is going to be one of those things  that haunts me i think  but
dOyrx5HOCyY,6185760,6191840,in that context i don't see an end for  x86  in gaming
dOyrx5HOCyY,6191840,6198239,i know right  how you gonna emulate x86
dOyrx5HOCyY,6198320,6204719,uh people have emulated other funky  stuff yeah but how are you gonna play  like
dOyrx5HOCyY,6204719,6212159,freaking  [Music]  doom eternal i don't know i don't have  an answer for you emulated like it's not
dOyrx5HOCyY,6212159,6217520,i mean maybe in pcie gen 11 yeah like  that's what i'm talking it might be that  far ahead
dOyrx5HOCyY,6217520,6224800,like i don't know  i don't know  yeah it's a little weird but we'll see
dOyrx5HOCyY,6224800,6231199,dash d asks oh sorry go ahead that's  your job what's the best way to handle a  hot pc in a room you can't air condition
dOyrx5HOCyY,6231199,6236639,over the summer ducting  yeah  he's not wrong we should do a video on
dOyrx5HOCyY,6236639,6242639,that  have we not we haven't done a video on  just like ducting an intake like man for
dOyrx5HOCyY,6242639,6247760,for  under 50 bucks yeah pretty sure you can  get some some ducting
dOyrx5HOCyY,6247760,6252960,a fan some tape  and you can  considerably
dOyrx5HOCyY,6252960,6258960,cool your room in the summer and like if  you do it properly like if you get  actual ducting and stuff it won't even
dOyrx5HOCyY,6258960,6265920,look like that bad it'll look pretty bad  it's going to look bad if i do it but  you can also do it with cardboard
dOyrx5HOCyY,6265920,6271440,for basically nothing that will look bad  yeah  but it'll work or do it taran did and
dOyrx5HOCyY,6271440,6278880,just have it outside of your room  like his intel upgrade video yeah that  also works
dOyrx5HOCyY,6279360,6285199,cool  your pc he's making a note room yeah  yeah we're totally going to do that
dOyrx5HOCyY,6285199,6291360,video  uh while you type that down from  avrohom
dOyrx5HOCyY,6291360,6296800,sorry if that's wrong do you think it's  a good idea to use port forwarding to  remotely access my nas if not is there a
dOyrx5HOCyY,6296800,6304159,more secure way you can recommend  i'll let luke handle this one i know  that having open ports is generally not
dOyrx5HOCyY,6304159,6311119,the best an alternative that i do not  have  it depends it depends on how their nas
dOyrx5HOCyY,6311119,6316239,is set up  um  it depends on how they want to access it
dOyrx5HOCyY,6316239,6321280,like there's there's there's a lot  more that you would need i would need to
dOyrx5HOCyY,6321280,6327679,know yeah try posting in our forum we  have a lot of smart people that will  definitely help you out yes
dOyrx5HOCyY,6327679,6334880,from samuel uh but yeah probably not the  ports but  yeah like it's
dOyrx5HOCyY,6338159,6343440,i don't know any time you open it up at  all there's going to be security  problems which is why i don't really
dOyrx5HOCyY,6343440,6349040,want to say something um  but like remoting in is a solution
dOyrx5HOCyY,6349040,6354159,uh having a private vpn is a solution  that's how a lot of companies do that  type of stuff
dOyrx5HOCyY,6354159,6360000,if you're comfortable with setting that  up  then sure yeah i just more secure
dOyrx5HOCyY,6360000,6366400,my hesitation there was if you didn't  already know that it might be hard uh  but there are guides on how to do that
dOyrx5HOCyY,6366400,6372159,stuff i think you guys even have one  uh so maybe watch the ltt one  last i looked at it it actually looked
dOyrx5HOCyY,6372159,6378639,like it was still fairly up to date so  maybe check that out  but yeah most companies do
dOyrx5HOCyY,6378639,6384639,vpns and whatever you do don't take  advice from youtube chat where uh mr
dOyrx5HOCyY,6384639,6390000,sharples over there says dmz the naz  nice
dOyrx5HOCyY,6390000,6394159,let's go  let's go
dOyrx5HOCyY,6396080,6401119,please no  but yeah it depends on it depends on  what you want to do with it i would
dOyrx5HOCyY,6401119,6406639,argue like if you're if you're trying to  play music on your phone anywhere in the  world it might need to be a little bit
dOyrx5HOCyY,6406639,6412800,more open i tech cat asks with linus's  workstation as a rack server in his  racket home to draw the noise and heat
dOyrx5HOCyY,6412800,6418719,away from where he works in games does  that mean he could just log into his  workstation from different stations like  one day in the office next from the
dOyrx5HOCyY,6418719,6426560,comfort of his bed okay so the way  that's set up is with optical  displayport and usb connections
dOyrx5HOCyY,6426560,6432080,for that reason yes i could access it  from anywhere but only wherever i ran
dOyrx5HOCyY,6432080,6438080,optical displayport and optical usb  because otherwise i am limited by
dOyrx5HOCyY,6438080,6444000,the  by the bandwidth and realistically it's  not really a bandwidth limitation it's  an encoding and decoding
dOyrx5HOCyY,6444000,6449679,uh performance limitation  of ethernet right  so  [Music]
dOyrx5HOCyY,6449679,6456400,typically when you remote into a station  at best you're doing like maybe 60  megabit per second
dOyrx5HOCyY,6456400,6461840,if you're using nbank for encoding yeah  and it's costing you about a frame at
dOyrx5HOCyY,6461840,6469119,60fps of time for that encode and decode  process  plus network transit time so it's going
dOyrx5HOCyY,6469119,6475920,to be blocky you're not going to have  support for advanced features like vr or  hdr or anything like that
dOyrx5HOCyY,6475920,6481760,so yes you can access the station from  anywhere but that's just that's  basically parsec so at home what i'm
dOyrx5HOCyY,6481760,6487760,doing is i'm using usb and displayport  and thunderbolt to have it be exactly  like i'm sitting right in front of it
dOyrx5HOCyY,6487760,6494639,there's no additional latency and no  quality loss so it's a pretty different  solution  tony b in full plane chat said if you do
dOyrx5HOCyY,6494639,6501040,use a vpn still secure the services if  it was exposed to the internet the vpn  is in addition to that security not in
dOyrx5HOCyY,6501040,6506719,place of it that so that's what i'm kind  of saying like the second you start  accessing it remotely you open yourself
dOyrx5HOCyY,6506719,6513040,to security concerns that's just  it's just how it be my dude so yeah i'm
dOyrx5HOCyY,6513040,6519840,not saying you necessarily shouldn't do  it  um but  yeah
dOyrx5HOCyY,6521199,6526639,from eric what happened to the one  million dollar computer series
dOyrx5HOCyY,6526639,6533679,jake was busy helping me finish my house  so are they gonna ask for it back yeah
dOyrx5HOCyY,6533679,6539920,yeah it's going back at some point but  uh jake needs to finish working on it i  think he actually did put some work into
dOyrx5HOCyY,6539920,6546239,it this week but nice um he's been  covering for someone else this week as  well so i don't think he put in as much
dOyrx5HOCyY,6546239,6554239,work on it as he wanted to hopefully  we'll shoot another segment next week  with like some actual benchmarks
dOyrx5HOCyY,6554239,6560159,from alexander how have the creases been  on your fold i have mine and it's  getting horrible crease marks and the
dOyrx5HOCyY,6560159,6565280,screen protector they say not to remove  is starting to tear and crease
dOyrx5HOCyY,6565280,6570639,funny you asked  luke what do you see at the top of my  screen oh it's starting to bubble out
dOyrx5HOCyY,6570639,6575679,yep this just happened you can actually  probably see it from there yep it just
dOyrx5HOCyY,6575679,6581520,started to separate in the last  maybe
dOyrx5HOCyY,6581520,6588239,couple of weeks so it made it a long  time i didn't even think the screen  protector was removable to be honest
dOyrx5HOCyY,6588239,6593280,with you i thought it was a permanent  part of the display but it appears to be
dOyrx5HOCyY,6593280,6600080,not because you can kind of see it  coming away at the bottom here too  that's pretty rough should i try and  peel it off all the way or no are you
dOyrx5HOCyY,6600080,6605840,able to do that i i remember hearing  very early on in this device's life that  people didn't realize
dOyrx5HOCyY,6605840,6612080,that it was actually like a part of the  screen and they peeled it off and it  broke things i thought that was the  second gen one maybe i don't know
dOyrx5HOCyY,6612080,6618719,actually can't remember  twitch chat obviously is like yes now
dOyrx5HOCyY,6618719,6624400,yeah i think i'll wait for someone a  little more level-headed to to to pitch  in here
dOyrx5HOCyY,6624400,6631520,should we do we have the new thing  the polling system  no oh all right well never mind
dOyrx5HOCyY,6631520,6636639,people are like yeah yeah float planes  like no do not web version is done but
dOyrx5HOCyY,6636639,6642159,you go stop stop no it's not removable  don't well that sucks then because
dOyrx5HOCyY,6642159,6647599,it's gonna get to the point of not being  very pleasant to use like this is  clearly visible
dOyrx5HOCyY,6647599,6652800,oh that's terrible actually yeah yeah  like it's it's off uh okay that one's
dOyrx5HOCyY,6652800,6659440,kind of hard to see from there but  i have like the worst bump yeah i can  it's yeah yeah it's like having an awful
dOyrx5HOCyY,6659440,6666080,notch yeah or notch there we go yeah  yeah  if you do do it on stream all right
dOyrx5HOCyY,6666080,6672639,forget it i mean that for sure on that  one  from  michelle
dOyrx5HOCyY,6672639,6678960,linus do you still like the unified  doorbell he had installed at your old  house yeah how was the latency do you  have any experience with any other smart
dOyrx5HOCyY,6678960,6684639,doorbells i don't have experience with  other ones but what i know about the  unify one is that it doesn't upload the
dOyrx5HOCyY,6684639,6691119,comings and goings at my house to anyone  else and i like that  i can the latency is i don't know it's
dOyrx5HOCyY,6691119,6696639,usable usually i can catch people before  they leave the door but as always it  depends on your mobile data connection
dOyrx5HOCyY,6696639,6704080,the  the feature that was missing at the  beginning that drove me crazy is the  ability to replay with one touch the
dOyrx5HOCyY,6704080,6710320,person coming and going so a lot of the  time if i took if i took 30 seconds to  get to the notification i would have to
dOyrx5HOCyY,6710320,6715520,go painstakingly scrub and try and find  the exact moment that someone came to  the door and it wasn't very good at
dOyrx5HOCyY,6715520,6721199,expanding and shrinking the timeline  back then but it's really good now so  you can either look at it live and talk
dOyrx5HOCyY,6721199,6726960,to them immediately  or you can go back to the event and just  see what it was because a lot of the  time it's just someone coming up ringing
dOyrx5HOCyY,6726960,6732800,the doorbell leaving a package and going  from micah we've actually gotten this  question a few times do you have any
dOyrx5HOCyY,6732800,6739599,thoughts on the matter smart home  ecosystem  yeah i i'm super stoked on it but
dOyrx5HOCyY,6739599,6744960,there's just it's not ready yet so  for all the good it does me i mean  that's the thing about technology right
dOyrx5HOCyY,6744960,6751280,is you can keep waiting waiting waiting  waiting waiting waiting for the next big  thing around the corner or at some point
dOyrx5HOCyY,6751280,6758880,you just have to buy something and enjoy  it so that's what i decided to do i went  i went z-wave and
dOyrx5HOCyY,6758880,6764400,we'll see how that goes  yeah there was a there was a question in  here that that i don't know what
dOyrx5HOCyY,6764400,6769679,happened to it but it was asking me if i  would ever consider building a mineral  oil machine again
dOyrx5HOCyY,6769679,6777199,and i wanted to address that because  i'm still thinking of ideas but if my  name ever gets drawn in
dOyrx5HOCyY,6777199,6782800,the intel extreme  thing  uh i was thinking of making linus build
dOyrx5HOCyY,6782800,6789040,another mineral machine as  as a joke  i've been actually considering it
dOyrx5HOCyY,6789040,6796159,just because i think it would be so  funny  we have  the facilities to probably do it as well
dOyrx5HOCyY,6796159,6802080,as puget or better now  with the with the workshop and  everything like it could actually be
dOyrx5HOCyY,6802080,6809679,pretty sick um so i've been considering  it but like  i'm far from dedicating to it and i mean
dOyrx5HOCyY,6809679,6816560,my name would have to be drawn and  there's kind of a few people that work  here now so it i mean my name might just
dOyrx5HOCyY,6816560,6822719,never be drawn so it might also just not  happen um  yeah
dOyrx5HOCyY,6822960,6828239,yes definitely do that by the way  somebody suggested uh a desk mineral oil
dOyrx5HOCyY,6828239,6833920,pc so you can just combine both of  linus's least favorite types of builds  oh no
dOyrx5HOCyY,6833920,6842160,oh no the amount of places that that  could start leaking  [Laughter]
dOyrx5HOCyY,6842320,6849040,no  not that  one one of the really nice things about  fish tanks is you usually try to find
dOyrx5HOCyY,6849040,6857119,ones that are  that are solid piece on the bottom  so that there isn't like a seal point um
dOyrx5HOCyY,6857119,6863360,that's often of a very notable benefit  use 3m novak i mean i guess if i'm
dOyrx5HOCyY,6863360,6868880,getting the company to pay for it i  don't think you'll be able to afford it  probably not not in that it's so
dOyrx5HOCyY,6868880,6874560,expensive crazy expense there are some  other alternative stuff these days um
dOyrx5HOCyY,6874560,6879760,that that isn't as expensive as novak  i would i would dive into it more if we
dOyrx5HOCyY,6879760,6884800,were actually doing it but yeah  from exode have you guys heard anything
dOyrx5HOCyY,6884800,6889840,about e-leap oled technology that came  out about a month or so ago no but i saw
dOyrx5HOCyY,6889840,6896239,this merch message ahead of time so i  pulled up an article about it apparently  it's from japan display inc
dOyrx5HOCyY,6896239,6902560,it allows much much brighter oleds and  with better longevity and apparently
dOyrx5HOCyY,6902560,6908960,it's not just a lab experiment this is  actual display technology that they are  ready to start shipping sooner rather
dOyrx5HOCyY,6908960,6915280,than later it sounds  really exciting sounds like between qd  oled from samsung and lg juicing up
dOyrx5HOCyY,6915280,6920800,their existing oled and japan display um  unveiling this new method of making oled
dOyrx5HOCyY,6920800,6927679,tvs that things are about to get  competition's about to get fierce which  is always good it's good for pricing for
dOyrx5HOCyY,6927679,6933520,the consumer very good  so i'm jacked
dOyrx5HOCyY,6933520,6939440,from aaron hello linus and luke hope the  new house construction is going smoothly  what are your thoughts on manufacturing
dOyrx5HOCyY,6939440,6947920,are manufactured moving to smart bulbs  and internet of things in terms of cyber  security it's bad but i want to try it
dOyrx5HOCyY,6947920,6952719,like a problem so i'm gonna do it  basically
dOyrx5HOCyY,6953440,6959080,iot botnets iot botnets iot botnets
dOyrx5HOCyY,6960639,6969360,uh from christopher have you seen all  the new stuff from aya the slide neo2  flip etc uh yes i uh oh what can i say
dOyrx5HOCyY,6969360,6974880,yes  yes what's the flip
dOyrx5HOCyY,6974880,6980560,oh they're they're doing so much right  now i  cannot figure out how they have all the
dOyrx5HOCyY,6980560,6987520,money money they need to to work on all  these projects uh they've got an  indiegogo campaign going right now for
dOyrx5HOCyY,6987520,6993119,oh which one is it i can't remember  which one but there's a there's a  campaign running right now
dOyrx5HOCyY,6993119,6999679,i'll just check my slam shell windows  handheld interesting yeah they've got  some really cool stuff going on dual
dOyrx5HOCyY,6999679,7004719,screen  i'm not seeing very good pictures yeah  the air is the one they have an
dOyrx5HOCyY,7004719,7011679,indiegogo campaign it's funded already  as far as i can tell it's less about  actually getting funding and more about
dOyrx5HOCyY,7011679,7017119,taking pre-orders and marketing and all  that kind of stuff the air looks pretty  sick
dOyrx5HOCyY,7017119,7023760,looking forward to checking that out  i think they should start doing it on  their own site so they can stop paying  indiegogo for doing almost nothing but
dOyrx5HOCyY,7023760,7030080,that's just my opinion kitty kitty in  floatplane chat says hey linus and luke
dOyrx5HOCyY,7030080,7035920,hear me out solid block of acrylic  machined out i was i've had a lot of
dOyrx5HOCyY,7035920,7041440,funky ideas i was i was thinking  potentially even custom glass can you
dOyrx5HOCyY,7041440,7047440,get a solid block of acrylic probably i  don't know
dOyrx5HOCyY,7047599,7052960,solid acrylic blocks i mean here let's  uh  let's learn shall we i mean that thing
dOyrx5HOCyY,7052960,7058880,looks big  i don't know i can never i can never  tell  this is one by one by one inch like i
dOyrx5HOCyY,7058880,7065599,want a big one  like  that would be heavy you know at a  certain point
dOyrx5HOCyY,7065599,7071679,even just you know cheap crappy acrylic  or whatever  gets heavy
dOyrx5HOCyY,7071679,7078000,lucite block  okay this is all just like cute little  little decorative stuff
dOyrx5HOCyY,7078000,7084239,okay large acrylic block  acrylic acrylic cylinders up to eight
dOyrx5HOCyY,7084239,7089679,feet in size now we're talking  oh nope that's not quite what i had in
dOyrx5HOCyY,7089679,7095840,mind  okay then  i don't know what came up acrylic blocks
dOyrx5HOCyY,7095840,7102159,out water  okay
dOyrx5HOCyY,7102159,7108560,well those are like windows or something  clear extra large block
dOyrx5HOCyY,7108560,7115119,well clearly this requires a little bit  more work than what i was willing to put  into it live acrylic can apparently also
dOyrx5HOCyY,7115119,7121599,be cast  mmm  cool
dOyrx5HOCyY,7121599,7126800,all right  as a follow-up to the indian question  and you pulling it out earlier have you
dOyrx5HOCyY,7126800,7132400,still been using the steam deck  i  prefer the io neo
dOyrx5HOCyY,7132400,7138320,i like the smaller more compact shape of  it one thing that's really cool about
dOyrx5HOCyY,7138320,7144800,the steam deck though is the way that  the thermal mod that we did on it  unlocks extra performance that was
dOyrx5HOCyY,7144800,7150880,pretty sick  but yes i've been using the io pro
dOyrx5HOCyY,7151599,7157199,i forget is that what this one's called  ineo ieno  pro sorry that's the that's the one that
dOyrx5HOCyY,7157199,7164159,i've been using  and a big part of it honestly is that  i'm just lazy i don't like setting  things up more than once and the os
dOyrx5HOCyY,7164159,7171199,dried that i have in there is one of  those eight terabyte severant ones so i  can just dump absolutely
dOyrx5HOCyY,7171199,7176880,everything onto it emulated games steam  games whatever it's all just
dOyrx5HOCyY,7176880,7183199,dumped onto here i never have to think  about it i don't set it up again i just  each i neo i just pull it out and put it
dOyrx5HOCyY,7183199,7189119,into the next one  that's pretty sweet so i got a system  here
dOyrx5HOCyY,7189119,7195280,that's cool  in that same beat uh there was a  question for luke did you cancel your  steam deck pre-order or have you been
dOyrx5HOCyY,7195280,7201119,tempted by aya products  um i actually have been tempted by aya
dOyrx5HOCyY,7201119,7208639,products for some like thing reasons  that honestly shouldn't necessarily  matter too much but i think  aesthetically they just look awesome um
dOyrx5HOCyY,7208639,7214960,like that retro one you showed off yeah  was so cool like i it was just sweet
dOyrx5HOCyY,7214960,7221199,they're just kind of nerds they are  geeks or whatever whatever the right  terms you can tell yeah uh just awesome
dOyrx5HOCyY,7221199,7228400,um  i have not canceled it at this point  i'm not feeling super motivated to buy
dOyrx5HOCyY,7228400,7234480,but i've had a bunch of friends say like  hey like i would  like pay the purchase cost if you could
dOyrx5HOCyY,7234480,7240400,get it for me and i'm like okay well  i'll hold my reservation  um i'm not gonna like you gonna scalp it
dOyrx5HOCyY,7240400,7247920,no you're gonna scalp it literally no  i'm not going to see you're gonna be a  filthy dirty rotten ugly awful stinky
dOyrx5HOCyY,7247920,7253760,scalper we got a little specific there  at the end uh  no but i i might like yeah i don't think
dOyrx5HOCyY,7253760,7260000,you're ugly yeah thank you  it's appreciated um  but yeah it's very likely i'll hand it
dOyrx5HOCyY,7260000,7265840,off to someone else in my life that was  unable to get uh a reservation so
dOyrx5HOCyY,7265840,7270639,yeah  yeah don't scalp but just know i will  pay double
dOyrx5HOCyY,7272880,7279040,bell you're part of the problem  officially  sorry  uh from keith is there any recent books
dOyrx5HOCyY,7279040,7284159,you've read and enjoyed for either of  you  i don't find nearly enough time to read
dOyrx5HOCyY,7284159,7291840,i read a lot of articles i  i keep up with world events a lot more  than i used to but my problem with
dOyrx5HOCyY,7291840,7298880,reading  is that the second i start something  i it's unlikely that i will sleep until
dOyrx5HOCyY,7298880,7304000,i finish it  and so i'm afraid to pick up new books
dOyrx5HOCyY,7304000,7311040,because it kind of destroys my life for  a couple of days  i know that's like a really horrible
dOyrx5HOCyY,7311040,7317520,cop-out stupid response to that but i  don't read much fiction for that reason
dOyrx5HOCyY,7317520,7325159,i'm gonna also cop out slightly but i  will give two books um these were
dOyrx5HOCyY,7329520,7335840,tyler and i used to share book  recommendations  back in the day  and these were my two favorite ones that
dOyrx5HOCyY,7335840,7341280,he ever suggested to me  one of them is uprooted by  uh
dOyrx5HOCyY,7341280,7346800,naomi novik and the other one is barsk  the elephant's graveyard by
dOyrx5HOCyY,7346800,7352719,lawrence m schoen  uh  those were those are some of the first
dOyrx5HOCyY,7352719,7358320,books that he ever recommended to me and  they are both fantastic i would highly  recommend them
dOyrx5HOCyY,7359199,7364400,oh  matthew b says i took the protector off  my fold three due to the same issue it's
dOyrx5HOCyY,7364400,7369920,basically just a normal protector just  take it off slow  it's nothing inbuilt that ruins the
dOyrx5HOCyY,7369920,7375360,display  should i go for it yolo do it
dOyrx5HOCyY,7375360,7380400,we'll do it live  okay we ready uh oh i guess uh do you
dOyrx5HOCyY,7380400,7386320,need a tool do you need something to  help  um you're just gonna go at it i think  i'm just gonna go at it i mean there's
dOyrx5HOCyY,7386320,7391440,enough of a gap there i feel like i can  just get a fingernail in it you know  whoa
dOyrx5HOCyY,7391440,7396800,wait a second  did you hear that sound when i opened it  i didn't
dOyrx5HOCyY,7396800,7402560,did you hear that like like  there that sound  the whole thing came off whoa
dOyrx5HOCyY,7402560,7411598,look at that there's a whole line that  is separated down the middle that  just happened so it's it's like sticking
dOyrx5HOCyY,7412639,7419360,oh wow that's super audible when you put  it up yeah maybe it wasn't so much that  i heard it as that i felt it when i did
dOyrx5HOCyY,7419360,7425040,it so uh  here hold on i'm just gonna i'll turn so  you guys can see if it
dOyrx5HOCyY,7425040,7432000,busts it then you'll be the first to  know  okay
dOyrx5HOCyY,7432000,7437679,oh okay oh that's yeah that's no problem  that appears to be just a screen  protector
dOyrx5HOCyY,7437679,7443040,i'm kind of impressed it lasts this  lasted this long then yeah well where do  i get a new one now like does samsung
dOyrx5HOCyY,7443040,7449039,make this screen protector available  because it's pretty good it actually  feels very glass-like
dOyrx5HOCyY,7449280,7455920,honestly i think i kind of like the feel  of the screen protector better than the  screen itself here try out both
dOyrx5HOCyY,7458960,7464000,yeah it feels like uh  smoother almost i don't know why maybe
dOyrx5HOCyY,7464000,7470239,there's some adhesive on the screen or  something  i no i don't think so it's it's just  it's a very plasticky screen because
dOyrx5HOCyY,7470239,7475118,it's not glass right yeah yeah yeah  makes sense interesting
dOyrx5HOCyY,7476000,7482079,all right  oh hey it looks uh looks nice and clean  now so that's cool
dOyrx5HOCyY,7482079,7487920,bring up some content here  oh got some bob's burgers you know i  haven't seen the movie yet i'm gonna go
dOyrx5HOCyY,7487920,7494560,see there's a movie yeah there's bob's  burgers movie i did not know yeah bob's  burger's having like a moment right now
dOyrx5HOCyY,7494560,7501199,all right  from i blow it sports in a recent video  you mentioned you sleep with your  earbuds in and you've mentioned it today
dOyrx5HOCyY,7501199,7506800,as well uh i do the same with my sony  xm4 earbuds only fall asleep with  audiobooks are you concerned at all
dOyrx5HOCyY,7506800,7514000,about long-term hearing loss about using  headphones while sleeping  oh oh specifically i
dOyrx5HOCyY,7514000,7520560,whatever asks mentions um noise  cancellation  um
dOyrx5HOCyY,7520560,7526480,no i can't say i've ever had any  concerns about that i haven't noticed  any problems up until now i don't turn
dOyrx5HOCyY,7526480,7531920,them up that's for sure  and i don't think that they would
dOyrx5HOCyY,7531920,7539760,be counteracting any strong sound waves  coming  in if i'm just sleeping with them
dOyrx5HOCyY,7539760,7545679,to be perfectly honest with you i have  thought about before and meant to  research it and i do not know the answer
dOyrx5HOCyY,7545679,7551679,to the question of  weather active noise cancellation you  know when so you got the wave right and
dOyrx5HOCyY,7551679,7558480,then you've got the wave that cancels it  out whether it actually mitigates any  damage that would be done to your ear by
dOyrx5HOCyY,7558480,7566560,a very loud noise i i don't i don't know  the answer to that  um maybe someone else does
dOyrx5HOCyY,7567760,7572880,it seems like it would be fine  something i'd throw in there is because  we're just because we're talking about
dOyrx5HOCyY,7572880,7579199,like you're not a doctor hearing loss  and stuff like that something that i've  been concerned about uh
dOyrx5HOCyY,7579199,7585520,is the buddies  they can sometimes be really loud yeah  um
dOyrx5HOCyY,7585520,7590719,and they they sit like right next to me  all the time um so i've started to be
dOyrx5HOCyY,7590719,7596800,concerned about that i might be looking  into  i don't want to because i love my  headphones but i might be looking into
dOyrx5HOCyY,7596800,7601920,like closed back headphones or something  to try to like isolate from
dOyrx5HOCyY,7601920,7608800,from the freaking part of the budgies uh  they're often  fine  but when they're like real amped up for
dOyrx5HOCyY,7608800,7615280,whatever reason on some day and they're  just like  it's like when i call they're just like
dOyrx5HOCyY,7615280,7620320,just oh my goodness yeah yeah so when  they're in like that mood um
dOyrx5HOCyY,7620320,7626320,it it  yeah i get a little concerned because i  think they can go up to like 70 decibels
dOyrx5HOCyY,7626320,7633040,oh i would say they're probably higher  than that  [Laughter]  yeah i don't know
dOyrx5HOCyY,7633040,7638400,um  i'm gonna look it up
dOyrx5HOCyY,7638400,7644800,budgies apparently yeah about 70. about  70 yeah wow lovebirds will hit 83. some
dOyrx5HOCyY,7644800,7650960,birds can get  really up there they gotta they gotta  get that love out there you know i think
dOyrx5HOCyY,7650960,7657040,i think the the luck with the budgie is  it's literally too small to produce any  more noise
dOyrx5HOCyY,7657040,7663040,it's like physically incapable they  weigh 30 grams like  there's only so much they can accomplish
dOyrx5HOCyY,7663040,7668719,uh yeah  wow all right  question here from alex alainis have you
dOyrx5HOCyY,7668719,7675119,made a decision on your main tv and your  gaming monitor yet have you looked at  the sony a95k ah there will be a video
dOyrx5HOCyY,7675119,7680400,on that very soon  i can spoil it for you a little the sony
dOyrx5HOCyY,7680400,7686079,is  really really nice  like  wow
dOyrx5HOCyY,7686079,7692000,really nice  one of the one of my pro arts died  one of my like super old school pro
dOyrx5HOCyY,7692000,7698159,really yeah so one of them's still  working and then my like main gaming  monitor is obviously fine yeah one of
dOyrx5HOCyY,7698159,7704400,the pro arts is out and  i don't like being down to two monitors  so i've been trying to figure out like
dOyrx5HOCyY,7704400,7711119,do i like splurge get a new gaming  monitor do you go big do i go big do you  go multiple do i get a third again if i
dOyrx5HOCyY,7711119,7717440,get a third if like i could cheap out  and just buy like another 24-inch 1080p  monitor for like nothing and just get a
dOyrx5HOCyY,7717440,7724079,third monitor up again that's probably  fine  like probably what it'll do that's  probably what i'll do because i was
dOyrx5HOCyY,7724079,7729520,thinking about upgrading the gaming  monitor but i honestly like it has all  the features that i really want right
dOyrx5HOCyY,7729520,7736480,now i like 1440p  isn't it yeah  yeah 165 hertz 1440p they have 4k 240s
dOyrx5HOCyY,7736480,7742400,now  i can't run most games at that anyway no  one can samsung samsung
dOyrx5HOCyY,7742400,7747520,has a display that'll do 4k 240 hertz  i'm sitting here going sweet what's that
dOyrx5HOCyY,7747520,7753040,for what can run that yeah exactly so  like i i i think i still feel like my
dOyrx5HOCyY,7753040,7758960,monitor is still at kind of a sweet spot  i have really liked 1440p and really  high refresh rate
dOyrx5HOCyY,7758960,7765760,so it's fine so yeah i'll probably just  buy a cheap extra monitor but yeah  just wait till they see the cutie oled
dOyrx5HOCyY,7765760,7771760,monitors yeah spoil you forever yeah  really nice yeah but then like those
dOyrx5HOCyY,7771760,7776800,aren't really a thing you know yeah it's  only one yeah so like i think now is not
dOyrx5HOCyY,7776800,7783520,the time yeah  uh from kyle hi linus what do you think  about electric motorcycles like the zero
dOyrx5HOCyY,7783520,7789040,lineup any chance we'll see them on ltte  or short circuit i wanted to like
dOyrx5HOCyY,7789040,7795119,the zero motorbike that i went and test  drove um  here hold on i'm gonna bring it up and
dOyrx5HOCyY,7795119,7800480,i'll see if i can i'll see if i can find  the one i test drove  i i think you know we've gotten to the
dOyrx5HOCyY,7800480,7806320,point where  range has gotten reasonable enough that  they make sense i think that xero has
dOyrx5HOCyY,7806320,7811520,some models that look really cool this  is the srs i believe it was like a year
dOyrx5HOCyY,7811520,7821440,ago or two years ago model that i that i  tried but this was basically the one  that i test drove it is wicked fast um
dOyrx5HOCyY,7821440,7829760,where's the actual  where's the actual specs here 140  foot-pounds of torque 110 horsepower
dOyrx5HOCyY,7829760,7836719,there's an upgrade to a 17  17.3 kilowatt hour battery uh where's
dOyrx5HOCyY,7836719,7842239,the acceleration top speed 124 miles an  hour you do not need to go faster than
dOyrx5HOCyY,7842239,7848079,that i will tell you that much ladies  and gentlemen  full specs do they have like a 0 to 60
dOyrx5HOCyY,7848079,7853599,or anything like that in here  range oh my goodness where's your 0 to
dOyrx5HOCyY,7853599,7858639,60 why do you not have a 0 0-60 like  front and center  the only reason i can think of is
dOyrx5HOCyY,7858639,7864320,because maybe it's bad but the point is  it's very torquey
dOyrx5HOCyY,7864320,7869599,i actually walked into the i walked into  the dealership like with the money
dOyrx5HOCyY,7869599,7876079,already funding secured you know like  i had a combination of cash debit and  credit that would allow me to just buy
dOyrx5HOCyY,7876079,7882320,one walk out that day  and i was gonna just do it and yvonne  was like okay you need to test drive it
dOyrx5HOCyY,7882320,7889199,i'm like no no it's cool and my bike is  like it needs a whole bunch of work and  i just want to sell it and start over
dOyrx5HOCyY,7889199,7895199,with something fresh i want to go  electric i want to be able to just like  charge the bike not go to the gas  station i hate going to the gas station
dOyrx5HOCyY,7895199,7900639,on the bike it's just a hassle  it's got all your gear and everything  just sucks um so i was like i'm gonna do
dOyrx5HOCyY,7900639,7906560,it electric motorcycle she's like  you need to test drive him like i didn't  make an appointment i'm just gonna i'll
dOyrx5HOCyY,7906560,7912159,just buy it okay turns out one of the  people who worked there one of the sales  representatives was a fan was like uh  well we'll find you an appointment
dOyrx5HOCyY,7912159,7918239,because this was pete coveted times  right so it must have been a year ago  and  uh yeah you had to book everything in
dOyrx5HOCyY,7918239,7924400,advance and there's only three people  allowed in the store and blah blah blah  blah blah or whatever right  so
dOyrx5HOCyY,7924400,7929679,i take it out for the ride and they put  it in the equivalent of chill mode i  don't know that's the tesla terminology
dOyrx5HOCyY,7929679,7936159,for it but basically it's not like super  crazy torquey they put it in chill mode  and i'm riding down the road and i'm
dOyrx5HOCyY,7936159,7941360,like wow this is really soulless it's  like boring so i turn it up to whatever
dOyrx5HOCyY,7941360,7946639,the next notch is and then turn up  another notch  and it's just
dOyrx5HOCyY,7947520,7953520,sucks  so  i got back to the dealership
dOyrx5HOCyY,7953520,7959520,um where they were expecting to take  my money for a bike and instead i booked
dOyrx5HOCyY,7959520,7965760,an appointment to bring in my s  sv 650s  uh it's 2003. it's nothing special it's
dOyrx5HOCyY,7965760,7974079,worth like nothing now um to bring in my  sv650s  and spend more than it's actually worth
dOyrx5HOCyY,7974079,7980480,on just getting it for  new tires new chain just i needed a  whole bunch of stuff brought it in got
dOyrx5HOCyY,7980480,7987199,it done up and i've been happily riding  it this season so glad that i did not go  for an electric bike
dOyrx5HOCyY,7987199,7993920,i just i can't it's i'm not even i'm not  even a motorhead i'm not even like
dOyrx5HOCyY,7994840,8003040,i i don't need that stuff  but it just  oh i i drive a volt for crying out loud
dOyrx5HOCyY,8003040,8008239,i  i just couldn't do it i couldn't do it
dOyrx5HOCyY,8008239,8013920,last question here from oliver and again  a few other people surprisingly what was  the motivation behind switching from
dOyrx5HOCyY,8013920,8018960,google workspace to teams for  communication lmg  well google kept telling us hangouts was
dOyrx5HOCyY,8018960,8025679,going to go away and it's still not gone  there's still it even seems like they're  pushing it they've they've added
dOyrx5HOCyY,8025679,8032239,development have you seen this crap look  at this okay i go to share something  watch this i go to share and i'm like
dOyrx5HOCyY,8032239,8038560,gmail  oh okay well oh wait what just happened  not t what the f what was that
dOyrx5HOCyY,8038560,8044159,it doesn't matter the point is i go to  share something okay  watch this i click gmail it's like do
dOyrx5HOCyY,8044159,8049679,you mean gmail chat no i don't mean chat  i mean gmail you even have a separate
dOyrx5HOCyY,8049679,8057280,icon for gmail chat you saw it i swear i  swear you saw it next to it before right  the gmail chat one sure yes like no
dOyrx5HOCyY,8057280,8063040,why are you adding an extra click i'm  trying to email something  you are not chat anymore you told me
dOyrx5HOCyY,8063040,8069360,you're not chat anymore  and like the the the way that google has
dOyrx5HOCyY,8069360,8076800,dealt with their chat systems like part  part of this question is what do you  consider switching back it's like yeah  you know trust them yeah exactly um
dOyrx5HOCyY,8076800,8083199,because like moving an entire company to  a new chat system is like
dOyrx5HOCyY,8083360,8089280,really frustrating and genuinely has a  cost to it  so like no you don't really want to do
dOyrx5HOCyY,8089280,8094560,that  would i have suggested teams
dOyrx5HOCyY,8094560,8100159,no  well he tried slack and it was a  nightmare i don't understand i i was not
dOyrx5HOCyY,8100159,8107679,getting notifications i was getting  notifications for teams i literally  showed you a screenshot i know that i  got a notification on teams 172 days
dOyrx5HOCyY,8107679,8113159,late i have a screenshot of this it  literally says in the thing like how  long ago did this message come in
dOyrx5HOCyY,8113159,8119440,172d as in days  teams is a joke dumpster fire yes it is
dOyrx5HOCyY,8119440,8126079,i know  but we tried slack and it didn't work  so i don't know what to tell you we've
dOyrx5HOCyY,8126079,8131119,also had a lot of notifications problem  with slack i would say that recently  it's been a lot better
dOyrx5HOCyY,8131119,8136480,um but yeah we had notification problems  a lot in the past as well
dOyrx5HOCyY,8136800,8142960,yeah lapsed memory says google had such  a head start in the collab workspace and  they just
dOyrx5HOCyY,8143119,8148159,squandered it really it wasn't that long  ago that office 365 was a joke
dOyrx5HOCyY,8148159,8153360,and now  does anyone use anything else yeah yeah
dOyrx5HOCyY,8153360,8159679,it's the same kind of thing with like  msn messenger  like microsoft had discord
dOyrx5HOCyY,8159679,8165239,and not just not just discord microsoft
dOyrx5HOCyY,8167920,8174400,yeah yeah they had everything they could  have owned everything  like like actually
dOyrx5HOCyY,8174400,8180400,they just tossed it i mean while we're  at it soon oh yeah yeah
dOyrx5HOCyY,8180400,8185599,yeah  and i think that's it for the show today
dOyrx5HOCyY,8185599,8192638,thank you guys very much for tuning in  we will see you again next week same bad  time same terrible channel but you like
