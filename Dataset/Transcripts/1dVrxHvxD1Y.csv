1dVrxHvxD1Y,169,6700,Wheat futures prices are up 60% so far this year and after a heat wave damaged crops in
1dVrxHvxD1Y,6700,12160,"India, the country announced last week an immediate ban on wheat exports."
1dVrxHvxD1Y,12160,17610,The Indian government said that a spike in prices is threatening the security of a vital
1dVrxHvxD1Y,17610,22289,commodity both for India and for other vulnerable countries.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,22289,26210,India is the world’s second-biggest wheat producer after China.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,26210,31939,Thanks in part to a bumper harvest last year they had been able to fill the gap in markets
1dVrxHvxD1Y,31939,37940,"left by decreased output from Ukraine, even as bad weather reduced the crops of the other"
1dVrxHvxD1Y,37940,40010,big grain exporters.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,40010,45588,"In the global food system, supply–demand problems were previously mostly down to weather"
1dVrxHvxD1Y,45589,48520,and other supply-related factors.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,48520,54170,"In the last few years, the global pandemic tested, and in many ways proved, the resilience"
1dVrxHvxD1Y,54170,56218,of the global food supply system.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,56219,61969,"But now, with the war in Ukraine, we are seeing severe problems in the global food supply"
1dVrxHvxD1Y,61969,67720,chain and it’s difficult to predict the medium- or long-term implications.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,67720,72670,These new issues are occurring on top of an already tight – but at least functional
1dVrxHvxD1Y,72670,74438,- food supply chain.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,74439,81180,"Before the war in Ukraine, food prices had already risen 18% over the pandemic."
1dVrxHvxD1Y,81180,87530,"Globally, there are six breadbasket countries that together supply roughly two thirds of"
1dVrxHvxD1Y,87530,90610,global agricultural commodities.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,90610,95990,"Ukraine has long been one of the most important of these countries, producing food not just"
1dVrxHvxD1Y,95990,99890,for its own population but for people around the world.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,99890,103010,"Additionally, Ukraine produces a lot of fertilizer."
1dVrxHvxD1Y,103010,110130,57 percent of the land in Ukraine was used for growing crops in 2019 — making it one
1dVrxHvxD1Y,110130,113430,of the most highly-cultivated countries in the world.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,113430,122560,"By comparison, in the same year the US actively used 17 per cent of its land for cultivation."
1dVrxHvxD1Y,122560,128659,"Ukraine accounts for 30 per cent of the world’s supply of sunflower oil, widely used in food"
1dVrxHvxD1Y,128659,132690,"production, and grows 4 per cent of the world’s wheat."
1dVrxHvxD1Y,132690,137819,"While four percent may not sound like a huge number, the fact that they produce much more"
1dVrxHvxD1Y,137819,142599,than they consume means that that Ukraine accounts for around 10 per cent of global
1dVrxHvxD1Y,142599,149610,"wheat exports, 13 per cent of corn exports, and is the world’s largest producer of sunflower"
1dVrxHvxD1Y,149610,150610,oil.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,150610,157150,"Normally the country exports 40mn to 50mn tonnes of cereals every year, but Russia’s"
1dVrxHvxD1Y,157150,162640,invasion has meant export volumes in March were a quarter of those in February.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,162640,165860,The black soil in Ukraine is unusually fertile.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,165860,170990,Its farmland is cheaper to run than that in Europe and the United States.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,170990,176530,The country has deep seaports that give it easy access to international markets.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,176530,182560,"This combination has allowed Ukraine to become a key exporter of agricultural commodities,"
1dVrxHvxD1Y,182560,186049,and to be described as the breadbasket of Europe.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,186049,192890,"China is another important breadbasket, food produced by China makes up around 20% of total"
1dVrxHvxD1Y,192890,194650,world exports.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,194650,201110,The zero covid policy being enforced in China means that many farmers there are unable to
1dVrxHvxD1Y,201110,205280,"work, and far less food is being produced than normal."
1dVrxHvxD1Y,205280,211239,25 million tonnes of grain are currently stuck in Ukrainian ports that are being blockaded
1dVrxHvxD1Y,211239,213640,by Russian forces.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,213640,217900,Ukrainians have only managed to transport a “fraction” of their last harvest by
1dVrxHvxD1Y,217900,218900,rail.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,218900,223870,"The problem is that Ukraine has a different track gauge to the rest of Europe, so, freight"
1dVrxHvxD1Y,223870,226019,cars can’t just pass through.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,226019,231329,The grain needs to be unloaded and reloaded at borders causing a bottleneck.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,231329,237310,With swaths of Ukrainian farmland turning into battlefields and the countries road and
1dVrxHvxD1Y,237310,241540,port infrastructure under attack by Russian missiles and bombs.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,241540,245019,Ukraine’s food supply chain has entirely seized up.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,245019,250799,"There are limitations on farm working hours because of curfews, and there are limits on"
1dVrxHvxD1Y,250799,256090,the movement of agricultural equipment because of controls on the roads.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,256090,261549,"Even if peace was declared tomorrow, the fields of Ukraine are filled with unexploded ordinance,"
1dVrxHvxD1Y,261549,266690,"which farmers would need to clear, farming equipment has been destroyed, skilled workers"
1dVrxHvxD1Y,266690,272450,have been lost to the war and the time window for preparing fields for planting has passed.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,272450,277920,It is important to note that access to food is of urgent concern for the millions of Ukrainians
1dVrxHvxD1Y,277920,284520,"impacted directly by this tragic invasion, so I must acknowledge that vital priority."
1dVrxHvxD1Y,284520,290889,The damage to Ukraine’s transportation infrastructure has made getting food to internally displaced
1dVrxHvxD1Y,290890,293280,people extremely difficult.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,293280,299700,The World Food Programme estimates that 45 per cent of the population of Ukraine is worried
1dVrxHvxD1Y,299700,302560,about finding enough to eat.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,302560,308100,"Right now, we don’t know how long the conflict will last in Ukraine, but between 19 million"
1dVrxHvxD1Y,308100,314060,and 34 million tons of export production could disappear this year.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,314060,319550,"Next year, depending on the situation in Ukraine, the figure could be between ten million and"
1dVrxHvxD1Y,319550,321819,43 million tons.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,321820,329350,That translates into the necessary caloric intake for 60 million to 150 million people.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,329350,334830,"Apart from the obvious issues of people going hungry, a reduction in food supply means that"
1dVrxHvxD1Y,334830,340310,"prices can be expected to rise, and these higher prices will affect an even broader"
1dVrxHvxD1Y,340310,346090,"range of the world’s population, well beyond 150 million people."
1dVrxHvxD1Y,346090,351070,"Another problem the world is facing, is a shortage of the ingredients that go into synthetic"
1dVrxHvxD1Y,351070,357500,"fertilizers, which in some cases have tripled in price since the start of the pandemic."
1dVrxHvxD1Y,357500,363180,"Several problems contribute to this shortage, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine,"
1dVrxHvxD1Y,363180,368150,supply chain issues caused by storms and high natural gas prices.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,368150,373759,"For the first time ever, farmers the world over — all at once — are testing the limits"
1dVrxHvxD1Y,373760,380590,of how little fertilizer they can apply without devastating farm yields come harvest time.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,380590,386910,The nitrogen used in most synthetic fertilizers is made by combining the nitrogen in the air
1dVrxHvxD1Y,386910,392750,"with hydrogen in methane to produce ammonia, which is then used to create other forms of"
1dVrxHvxD1Y,392750,397170,nitrogen including ammonium nitrate and urea.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,397170,402850,Natural gas is used in this process both to provide the methane needed and as a heat source
1dVrxHvxD1Y,402850,404610,for the reaction.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,404610,408879,Higher natural gas prices mean more expensive fertilizer.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,408880,415360,Potash traded in Vancouver has almost tripled in price since the start of the war in Ukraine.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,415360,420530,"This is good for Canada, which is the largest producer of Potash in the world, but bad for"
1dVrxHvxD1Y,420530,423400,farmers and bad for food prices.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,423400,429410,Russia and Belarus are the number two and three producers of Potash in the world.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,429410,434520,Reduced grain exports from Ukraine will hit particularly hard in Africa and the Middle
1dVrxHvxD1Y,434520,438509,"East, where much of the country’s wheat goes."
1dVrxHvxD1Y,438510,443640,Ukraine accounts for 80 per cent of Lebanon’s wheat imports and is a leading supplier for
1dVrxHvxD1Y,443640,447180,"countries including Somalia, Syria, and Libya."
1dVrxHvxD1Y,447180,452960,"Egypt imports almost two-thirds of the wheat it consumes, making it the world’s largest"
1dVrxHvxD1Y,452960,454560,wheat importer.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,454560,460370,More than 80 per cent of the wheat Egypt imports comes from Russia and Ukraine.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,460370,466720,"And while a lot of the imports are for domestic consumption, Egypt also processes these commodities"
1dVrxHvxD1Y,466720,469030,to export to Eastern Africa.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,469030,474480,"So, the impact of the war in Ukraine will be felt across many nations."
1dVrxHvxD1Y,474480,479890,"Poor countries, which are already facing widespread hunger, will feel the pain the most."
1dVrxHvxD1Y,479890,486661,"The World Bank has warned that for each percentage point increase in food prices, 10mn additional"
1dVrxHvxD1Y,486661,490930,people are thrown into extreme poverty worldwide.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,490930,496320,"Countries that are food exporters are less likely to suffer, and countries like China"
1dVrxHvxD1Y,496320,500910,that have a strategic grain reserve are better positioned than most.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,500910,506910,"In fact, China may well decide to use some of their strategic grain reserve for diplomatic"
1dVrxHvxD1Y,506910,510800,purposes to generate goodwill from countries that are suffering.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,510800,514659,"So, how concerned should we be about global food shortages?"
1dVrxHvxD1Y,514659,519620,"It is difficult to say right now, as we need to keep an eye on incoming data in the coming"
1dVrxHvxD1Y,519620,524990,"weeks and months, but at present, the situation looks worse than it did during the last food"
1dVrxHvxD1Y,524990,529579,price crisis that happened in 2007 and 2008.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,529579,536800,A limited-disruption scenario would still likely have an impact that lasts until 2024.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,536800,543069,"In such a scenario we miss one planting season and see limited sanctions, (at least relating"
1dVrxHvxD1Y,543069,546639,to agricultural commodities and fertilizer).
1dVrxHvxD1Y,546640,552230,The reason that this would still have an impact out until 2024 is that farmers would take
1dVrxHvxD1Y,552230,555240,a while to recover to normal planting.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,555240,560829,"Missing a harvest or being unable to export would leave farmers low on funds for seeds,"
1dVrxHvxD1Y,560829,566339,"fertilizer, and agricultural equipment, making future harvests smaller."
1dVrxHvxD1Y,566339,572188,"In a situation where the war drags out much longer, several planting and harvesting seasons"
1dVrxHvxD1Y,572189,573639,could be missed.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,573639,578440,There could additionally be an escalation of sanctions which at some point could also
1dVrxHvxD1Y,578440,584370,"include some agricultural commodities, or there might be governments that stop exporting"
1dVrxHvxD1Y,584370,587878,vital commodities to countries that need them.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,587879,592450,This could result in significant problems in global food availability.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,592450,599149,The most recent period in history where we saw similar spikes in food prices was in 2007
1dVrxHvxD1Y,599149,601990,and the first half of 2008.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,601990,613699,"World prices for rice rose by 217%, wheat by 136%, corn by 125% and soybeans by 107%"
1dVrxHvxD1Y,613699,615779,over that period.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,615779,621170,The price rises brought about protests and riots in parts of Asia and Africa.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,621170,627230,"High food prices are likely to cause government interventions, which can sometimes only add"
1dVrxHvxD1Y,627230,628449,to the problem.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,628450,634300,"Things like food export bans, can reduce a farmer’s profitability, leaving him underfunded"
1dVrxHvxD1Y,634300,637529,to plant a larger crop for the next season.

1dVrxHvxD1Y,730279,735370,Now throughout history people have argued that the world is running out of food and
1dVrxHvxD1Y,735370,739839,"resources, and that is not the argument that I am making, but it does appear that there"
1dVrxHvxD1Y,739839,742329,might be quite a squeeze in the near term.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,742329,748760,It is probably reasonable to expect higher food prices if supplies remain constricted.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,748760,753201,"There are fortunately a number of ways that these problems can be dealt with, should they"
1dVrxHvxD1Y,753201,755820,last longer than expected.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,755820,762660,"While US corn farming is highly productive, and typical yields fall between 140 and 160"
1dVrxHvxD1Y,762660,768938,"bushels of corn per acre, unfortunately the food derived from all of that farming activity"
1dVrxHvxD1Y,768939,771180,is considerably lower.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,771180,776470,The corn crop in the United States is mostly used for biofuels and animal feed.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,776470,781660,(Around 40 percent of U.S. corn is used to make ethanol for use as fuel)
1dVrxHvxD1Y,781660,787699,The average Iowa cornfield has the potential to deliver more than 15 million calories per
1dVrxHvxD1Y,787699,795990,"acre each year (enough to sustain 15 people per acre, if we ate all of the corn ourselves),"
1dVrxHvxD1Y,795990,801300,"but with the current allocation of corn to ethanol and animal production, we end up with"
1dVrxHvxD1Y,801300,808628,"an estimated 3 million calories of food per acre per year, mainly as dairy and meat products,"
1dVrxHvxD1Y,808629,813180,which is enough to sustain only three people per acre per year.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,813180,818740,"That is lower than the average delivery of food calories from farms in Bangladesh, Egypt,"
1dVrxHvxD1Y,818740,819959,and Vietnam.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,819959,825438,The environmental credentials of using Corn derived ethanol as a fuel are being questioned
1dVrxHvxD1Y,825439,826579,right now.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,826579,832970,Dr. Tyler Lark from The University of Wisconsin did a study that found that ethanol is likely
1dVrxHvxD1Y,832970,841139,at least 24% more carbon-intensive than gasoline due to emissions resulting from land use changes
1dVrxHvxD1Y,841139,845430,"to grow corn, along with processing and combustion."
1dVrxHvxD1Y,845430,851329,"To be clear, some of the ethanol that is produced for fuel use is derived from other non-edible"
1dVrxHvxD1Y,851329,853269,plant materials.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,853269,860089,An explosion of farming technology in the 1960s— known as the Green Revolution—raised
1dVrxHvxD1Y,860089,862160,agricultural output significantly.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,862160,868209,"Today, further innovation could make a huge contribution to more secure and sustainable"
1dVrxHvxD1Y,868209,869670,food production.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,869670,875839,"Green technologies, biotech advances, and artificial intelligence could improve farming"
1dVrxHvxD1Y,875839,880490,"efficiency, reduce waste and safeguard ocean resources."
1dVrxHvxD1Y,880490,887290,"AI and modern sensors can be used to help food processors sort better, reducing food"
1dVrxHvxD1Y,887290,890579,waste and making better use of food byproducts.
1dVrxHvxD1Y,890579,896949,There are sensors being used by farmers that reduce calf mortality rates from birth-related
1dVrxHvxD1Y,896949,902649,complications by attaching a sensor to the cows tail which alerts the farmer when the

1dVrxHvxD1Y,912499,916860,"Agriculture is a traditional industry, but one that has been benefiting more and more"
1dVrxHvxD1Y,916860,919230,from modern technology.
