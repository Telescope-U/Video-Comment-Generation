NuheiTNzLd8,80,4480,is the m2 macbook pros slow ssds a big
NuheiTNzLd8,4480,7600,deal in the real world well today i will
NuheiTNzLd8,7600,11040,show you guys the proof and honestly i
NuheiTNzLd8,11040,13759,didn't expect it to be this much of a
NuheiTNzLd8,13759,15599,difference for those that use their
NuheiTNzLd8,15599,18160,macbook pro for professional uses or
NuheiTNzLd8,18160,21119,even semi-pro i was quite surprised now
NuheiTNzLd8,21119,23840,on friday we got the brand new m2
NuheiTNzLd8,23840,26000,macbook pro and we started testing it
NuheiTNzLd8,26000,29279,out we are super excited and then we ran
NuheiTNzLd8,29279,31599,into an issue when we ran the black
NuheiTNzLd8,31599,35120,magic disc speed test we saw that it was
NuheiTNzLd8,35120,37920,going really slow for some reason it did
NuheiTNzLd8,37920,40960,not make sense and then we opened up the
NuheiTNzLd8,40960,43680,back covers to find that there is only
NuheiTNzLd8,43680,47440,one nand chip for the ssd storage
NuheiTNzLd8,47440,49840,instead of two like with the m1 macbook
NuheiTNzLd8,49840,52399,pro that came out a year and a half ago
NuheiTNzLd8,52399,54719,and that explained it when you have half
NuheiTNzLd8,54719,57920,the chips the speed goes down and our
NuheiTNzLd8,57920,62399,write speed was 1400 instead of 2200 so
NuheiTNzLd8,62399,64799,that's gonna slow things down but with
NuheiTNzLd8,64799,67680,that the read speed was half the
NuheiTNzLd8,67680,70080,performance slightly less than half
NuheiTNzLd8,70080,73200,when do we ever have where a new laptop
NuheiTNzLd8,73200,75920,literally has speeds that are half
NuheiTNzLd8,75920,78240,compared to the previous version that
NuheiTNzLd8,78240,81439,was crazy now with that the new dell xps
NuheiTNzLd8,81439,82880,13 which we're going to be doing a
NuheiTNzLd8,82880,85280,comparison with against the m2 macbook
NuheiTNzLd8,85280,89040,pro that thing has blazing fast ssds
NuheiTNzLd8,89040,92880,incredible pc express 4.0 which apple is
NuheiTNzLd8,92880,94560,not even putting them in here but then
NuheiTNzLd8,94560,97200,we get this with the base model now some
NuheiTNzLd8,97200,98960,people online said that this is not a
NuheiTNzLd8,98960,101680,big deal that's still fast enough so we
NuheiTNzLd8,101680,103680,wanted to see for ourselves does it
NuheiTNzLd8,103680,105600,really make a big difference now
NuheiTNzLd8,105600,107040,transferring is one thing and i'll show
NuheiTNzLd8,107040,109200,you guys the performance difference but
NuheiTNzLd8,109200,111360,also with that when you're opening up
NuheiTNzLd8,111360,113119,different web browsing tasks you have
NuheiTNzLd8,113119,115439,one or two applications open and the ram
NuheiTNzLd8,115439,118079,eight gigs of ram fills up well that
NuheiTNzLd8,118079,120560,means that it has to use the ssd as ram
NuheiTNzLd8,120560,123200,for swap and here is the difference in
NuheiTNzLd8,123200,126560,performance i have 50 42 megapixel
NuheiTNzLd8,126560,128000,images opened right here with
NuheiTNzLd8,128000,130720,corrections and we ran this test on
NuheiTNzLd8,130720,132959,friday so now that we have some
NuheiTNzLd8,132959,134160,different things open i'm going to run
NuheiTNzLd8,134160,136560,it again now before i run it i want to
NuheiTNzLd8,136560,138160,show you guys what else i have open so i
NuheiTNzLd8,138160,140720,have photoshop right here let's press in
NuheiTNzLd8,140720,143680,and in here i have nine images open so
NuheiTNzLd8,143680,146160,nothing crazy no effects or anything
NuheiTNzLd8,146160,148959,else and right there you guys saw
NuheiTNzLd8,148959,152000,that the m1 macbook pro actually loaded
NuheiTNzLd8,152000,155040,that up faster now why could it do that
NuheiTNzLd8,155040,157280,when the single core score is way
NuheiTNzLd8,157280,159920,quicker in the m2 the fastest than any
NuheiTNzLd8,159920,162720,laptop multi-core and then graphics is
NuheiTNzLd8,162720,165120,faster well it's because we have the
NuheiTNzLd8,165120,167440,base model and ssds are much slower and
NuheiTNzLd8,167440,169440,just to prove to you guys here we have
NuheiTNzLd8,169440,170640,the m1
NuheiTNzLd8,170640,174000,and the m2 now i also want to mention
NuheiTNzLd8,174000,176239,that these base models sell like
NuheiTNzLd8,176239,178319,hotcakes not only are they kept in stock
NuheiTNzLd8,178319,180480,everywhere a bunch of websites online
NuheiTNzLd8,180480,182879,that sell them the apple store best buy
NuheiTNzLd8,182879,184640,it's just a great price point so that's
NuheiTNzLd8,184640,186560,why we were so happy with the m1 macbook
NuheiTNzLd8,186560,188400,air and m2 macbook air because they
NuheiTNzLd8,188400,190560,performed incredibly let's try it one
NuheiTNzLd8,190560,194480,more time with the first image here
NuheiTNzLd8,194640,196800,bam once again i mean that's not a huge
NuheiTNzLd8,196800,198560,difference but this is just opening up
NuheiTNzLd8,198560,200879,an image now here's google chrome you
NuheiTNzLd8,200879,202800,guys can see that i don't have an insane
NuheiTNzLd8,202800,204640,amount of tabs open and we've done some
NuheiTNzLd8,204640,207440,ram comparisons where we went all out
NuheiTNzLd8,207440,210640,for pro apps uh crazy stuff this ain't
NuheiTNzLd8,210640,212640,it a lot of you guys have more of tabs
NuheiTNzLd8,212640,214720,open than this let's open up youtube
NuheiTNzLd8,214720,216480,let's go to ign
NuheiTNzLd8,216480,219360,right there you guys saw that the m1 is
NuheiTNzLd8,219360,222159,snappier which it shouldn't be how about
NuheiTNzLd8,222159,223920,my google drive
NuheiTNzLd8,223920,226159,once again a little bit quicker we'll do
NuheiTNzLd8,226159,227760,one more
NuheiTNzLd8,227760,230720,there you go now this is where it's just
NuheiTNzLd8,230720,234879,weird that the m1 feels faster now let's
NuheiTNzLd8,234879,239200,just go ahead and export our 50 images
NuheiTNzLd8,239200,241040,and that was weird there because i'm
NuheiTNzLd8,241040,243120,pretty sure i clicked the lightroom here
NuheiTNzLd8,243120,245040,first and then i clicked it here this
NuheiTNzLd8,245040,247599,one loaded up quicker anyway so let's
NuheiTNzLd8,247599,250640,export now as you guys could see the m1
NuheiTNzLd8,250640,252239,is already
NuheiTNzLd8,252239,255200,rolling the m2 is just starting up now
NuheiTNzLd8,255200,257280,this will start to catch up a bit i
NuheiTNzLd8,257280,258880,actually ran this test before making
NuheiTNzLd8,258880,261359,this video i just want to see for myself
NuheiTNzLd8,261359,263199,does the ssd really matter and then once
NuheiTNzLd8,263199,264560,i start seeing results like this i'm
NuheiTNzLd8,264560,267600,like man it definitely does matter now
NuheiTNzLd8,267600,270240,the results are pretty shocking here's
NuheiTNzLd8,270240,272000,the first results from friday we have
NuheiTNzLd8,272000,273280,two minutes and i believe it was two
NuheiTNzLd8,273280,276000,minutes and 18 seconds and then once we
NuheiTNzLd8,276000,277600,have a couple pro apps open we're
NuheiTNzLd8,277600,280960,running an export and some tabs the m1
NuheiTNzLd8,280960,284240,takes 3 minutes and 36 seconds so you
NuheiTNzLd8,284240,286400,guys see it definitely gets lower
NuheiTNzLd8,286400,290639,whereas the m2 took 4 minutes and 12
NuheiTNzLd8,290639,295440,seconds so it gets slower than the m1
NuheiTNzLd8,295440,298240,and now we're running a photo merge in
NuheiTNzLd8,298240,299759,photoshop now i don't know what the
NuheiTNzLd8,299759,301680,results are going to be here
NuheiTNzLd8,301680,303680,i did not test this before when i was
NuheiTNzLd8,303680,305919,just testing for myself but we'll see
NuheiTNzLd8,305919,308800,what happens all right the m1 is done
NuheiTNzLd8,308800,311919,and we have to wait for the m2 all right
NuheiTNzLd8,311919,314880,so for some reason it crashed it was
NuheiTNzLd8,314880,319919,there right at the end so the m1 took 50
NuheiTNzLd8,319919,322800,seconds exactly whereas the m2 took a
NuheiTNzLd8,322800,325360,minute and 21 seconds it was right there
NuheiTNzLd8,325360,327360,at the end we're supposed to pop it open
NuheiTNzLd8,327360,329440,and it just crashed on me
NuheiTNzLd8,329440,331759,um i didn't think this would be as
NuheiTNzLd8,331759,334240,difficult of a test uh maybe it is more
NuheiTNzLd8,334240,335840,ram dependent and i want to make it
NuheiTNzLd8,335840,339120,clear that if you don't push your system
NuheiTNzLd8,339120,342080,very hard you might not care about this
NuheiTNzLd8,342080,343680,it won't make a difference if for
NuheiTNzLd8,343680,345199,example you have five tabs open and
NuheiTNzLd8,345199,347759,maybe photoshop open you know but a lot
NuheiTNzLd8,347759,349120,of people
NuheiTNzLd8,349120,350960,if they're buying a pro machine they
NuheiTNzLd8,350960,352720,want to be able to do more multitasking
NuheiTNzLd8,352720,355039,and more professional tasks so in that
NuheiTNzLd8,355039,357360,case you probably should go for the m2
NuheiTNzLd8,357360,360800,macbook air even more so now than before
NuheiTNzLd8,360800,362639,let's do a few more tests i'm going to
NuheiTNzLd8,362639,365520,do a transfer test and export a video
NuheiTNzLd8,365520,368319,now i also noticed a difference in
NuheiTNzLd8,368319,370720,snappiness even for the ui going through
NuheiTNzLd8,370720,374000,the file menu just general kind of
NuheiTNzLd8,374000,377360,slowness and stuttering and that's what
NuheiTNzLd8,377360,380720,made the m1 so good and now we know that
NuheiTNzLd8,380720,382160,it wasn't only because of the apple
NuheiTNzLd8,382160,383919,silicon and all the other great things
NuheiTNzLd8,383919,386240,but also because they put in really fast
NuheiTNzLd8,386240,388880,ssds even for the base model i'm gonna
NuheiTNzLd8,388880,391520,go ahead and quit photoshop here and
NuheiTNzLd8,391520,394560,let's go ahead and open up final cut pro
NuheiTNzLd8,394560,396639,we have a five minute project opened up
NuheiTNzLd8,396639,400000,right here with film grain applied and a
NuheiTNzLd8,400000,402560,couple luts for color correction which
NuheiTNzLd8,402560,405039,is standard for a lot of people and
NuheiTNzLd8,405039,407680,let's hit export now we did this exact
NuheiTNzLd8,407680,409759,test on friday and the m2 beat out the
NuheiTNzLd8,409759,412560,m1 by two seconds taking two minutes and
NuheiTNzLd8,412560,415199,23 seconds instead of two minutes and 25
NuheiTNzLd8,415199,418880,seconds this time the m1 took 3 minutes
NuheiTNzLd8,418880,423280,and 36 seconds whereas the m2 took four
NuheiTNzLd8,423280,426880,minutes and 49 seconds and that just
NuheiTNzLd8,426880,428240,shows you the difference that you could
NuheiTNzLd8,428240,429599,get now what i'm going to do right now
NuheiTNzLd8,429599,431919,is close down lightroom we had photoshop
NuheiTNzLd8,431919,434080,closed before we opened the final cut i
NuheiTNzLd8,434080,437199,also closed out some tabs and let's see
NuheiTNzLd8,437199,439759,what we get this time okay they started
NuheiTNzLd8,439759,442639,out pretty much neck and neck the m1 was
NuheiTNzLd8,442639,444800,one percent above and now it's taking
NuheiTNzLd8,444800,447520,the lead a little bit more so all right
NuheiTNzLd8,447520,451199,the m1 is almost done 99
NuheiTNzLd8,451199,453280,we're 87
NuheiTNzLd8,453280,458080,on the m2 and bam we are done on the m2
NuheiTNzLd8,458080,460160,the m1 took two minutes and 40 seconds
NuheiTNzLd8,460160,461919,so just slightly slower than when we
NuheiTNzLd8,461919,465840,just had final cut open and then the m2
NuheiTNzLd8,465840,468400,took three minutes and three
NuheiTNzLd8,468400,470639,seconds now we still have a bunch of
NuheiTNzLd8,470639,473039,tabs open i have my google drive i just
NuheiTNzLd8,473039,475520,closed a few of them there
NuheiTNzLd8,475520,478319,that i had just random safari open so
NuheiTNzLd8,478319,480319,let's check this out you guys could see
NuheiTNzLd8,480319,483280,i don't have uh lightroom open anymore
NuheiTNzLd8,483280,485039,photoshop open
NuheiTNzLd8,485039,487360,here are my tabs right here we have one
NuheiTNzLd8,487360,488960,video playing in the background
NuheiTNzLd8,488960,491199,oftentimes i'll have music or something
NuheiTNzLd8,491199,494000,else i have my google drive here and you
NuheiTNzLd8,494000,496479,know just some regular tabs
NuheiTNzLd8,496479,498080,and then let's go ahead and open up our
NuheiTNzLd8,498080,500560,activity monitor and see
NuheiTNzLd8,500560,502800,what it looks like so
NuheiTNzLd8,502800,504479,interestingly
NuheiTNzLd8,504479,506160,wow okay they're running a little bit
NuheiTNzLd8,506160,507280,differently
NuheiTNzLd8,507280,509120,so here we have both of eight gigs of
NuheiTNzLd8,509120,512399,ram memory used 7.19 gigs compared to
NuheiTNzLd8,512399,513839,6.5
NuheiTNzLd8,513839,517279,and that's because the m1 model is using
NuheiTNzLd8,517279,519039,more swap i don't know if there's more
NuheiTNzLd8,519039,520640,background tasks open i mean this is an
NuheiTNzLd8,520640,521839,older machine
NuheiTNzLd8,521839,523760,and as far as cache it also has more
NuheiTNzLd8,523760,526560,cache or maybe the m2 tries to not use
NuheiTNzLd8,526560,528800,swap as much because it knows as slower
NuheiTNzLd8,528800,530640,as disease i have no idea i'm not an
NuheiTNzLd8,530640,533120,engineer with ssds but you guys see the
NuheiTNzLd8,533120,535279,memory pressure right here looks very
NuheiTNzLd8,535279,537440,similar but you guys see the performance
NuheiTNzLd8,537440,540160,difference and now let's go ahead and
NuheiTNzLd8,540160,542480,quit final cut and we are going to do a
NuheiTNzLd8,542480,545200,transfer speed test i'm also closing a
NuheiTNzLd8,545200,547360,few of these tabs right here so we have
NuheiTNzLd8,547360,549920,a little bit less so i'm using my highly
NuheiTNzLd8,549920,553200,recommended sabrand external drive it is
NuheiTNzLd8,553200,555720,over thunderbolt but it does not hit
NuheiTNzLd8,555720,559120,2900 like the m1 macbook pro can so part
NuheiTNzLd8,559120,560640,of this test will be limited just by the
NuheiTNzLd8,560640,562399,speed itself but that doesn't matter
NuheiTNzLd8,562399,564880,this is real world and i have a 35
NuheiTNzLd8,564880,566959,gigabyte file here that i will be
NuheiTNzLd8,566959,568720,transferring so it started out pretty
NuheiTNzLd8,568720,571200,quick and then it slowed down quite a
NuheiTNzLd8,571200,572160,bit
NuheiTNzLd8,572160,573040,now
NuheiTNzLd8,573040,576399,uh we have plenty of space on this ssd
NuheiTNzLd8,576399,578320,but what i'm wondering
NuheiTNzLd8,578320,580880,is what about the slc cache we've talked
NuheiTNzLd8,580880,583519,about this before a lot of ssds have
NuheiTNzLd8,583519,585519,really fast speeds but then after you
NuheiTNzLd8,585519,588000,transfer a certain amount it slows down
NuheiTNzLd8,588000,590080,because they're slower chips that just
NuheiTNzLd8,590080,592480,have one portion that is quick
NuheiTNzLd8,592480,594160,we don't know what kind of ssd is in
NuheiTNzLd8,594160,596800,here and now that after 20 gigs we
NuheiTNzLd8,596800,598880,slowed down there are ssds after 20 gigs
NuheiTNzLd8,598880,600240,it starts slowing down
NuheiTNzLd8,600240,602240,that's what i'm curious about because
NuheiTNzLd8,602240,604959,it's writing way slower now so that took
NuheiTNzLd8,604959,608079,us a minute and 25 seconds to transfer
NuheiTNzLd8,608079,610560,and now transferring back to the ssd all
NuheiTNzLd8,610560,612720,right that's going way faster when
NuheiTNzLd8,612720,615440,you're transferring from the ssd to
NuheiTNzLd8,615440,617839,something else you don't have the soc
NuheiTNzLd8,617839,620160,cache limit except for unless your
NuheiTNzLd8,620160,622560,external drive has one which this one is
NuheiTNzLd8,622560,624000,very good which is why we highly
NuheiTNzLd8,624000,625680,recommend it we'll link it down in the
NuheiTNzLd8,625680,628399,description below so that took 58
NuheiTNzLd8,628399,630320,seconds to transfer it also slowed down
NuheiTNzLd8,630320,632720,a bit at the end and now the same file
NuheiTNzLd8,632720,634880,with the m1 macbook pro with the faster
NuheiTNzLd8,634880,636959,ssds all right wow this thing is
NuheiTNzLd8,636959,639120,speeding through it
NuheiTNzLd8,639120,641279,still going quick okay guys you saw that
NuheiTNzLd8,641279,644800,for yourselves 34 seconds and then going
NuheiTNzLd8,644800,648560,back that took 45 seconds so quicker
NuheiTNzLd8,648560,651920,than the m2 macbook but not by a huge
NuheiTNzLd8,651920,655600,amount because um this ssd is limiting
NuheiTNzLd8,655600,657680,it which of course this ssds in here are
NuheiTNzLd8,657680,659040,faster than most external even
NuheiTNzLd8,659040,661839,thunderbolt ones so there you guys go i
NuheiTNzLd8,661839,663839,was quite surprised when i wanted to
NuheiTNzLd8,663839,666079,test this out for myself to see if it
NuheiTNzLd8,666079,667519,really does make a big difference
NuheiTNzLd8,667519,669519,because people are saying no it doesn't
NuheiTNzLd8,669519,670800,really matter that much that's fast
NuheiTNzLd8,670800,673120,enough i was like surely it has to with
NuheiTNzLd8,673120,674399,swap
NuheiTNzLd8,674399,675440,because there should be some
NuheiTNzLd8,675440,677120,responsiveness differences and maybe if
NuheiTNzLd8,677120,679120,you're multitasking so i started
NuheiTNzLd8,679120,681279,checking it out for myself and i just
NuheiTNzLd8,681279,683760,had to share with you guys now
NuheiTNzLd8,683760,685519,i would just say
NuheiTNzLd8,685519,688000,it's still a good system but if you're
NuheiTNzLd8,688000,689519,buying one make sure you get at least
NuheiTNzLd8,689519,691680,512 gigabytes which is going to cost you
NuheiTNzLd8,691680,693120,an extra 200
NuheiTNzLd8,693120,695600,not even for the capacity but just to
NuheiTNzLd8,695600,698399,get the same speed of ssds that you got
NuheiTNzLd8,698399,701040,last year with the base m1 macbook pro
NuheiTNzLd8,701040,704959,or upgrade to 16 gigabytes of ram to
NuheiTNzLd8,704959,706800,make sure that you don't go into that
NuheiTNzLd8,706800,710160,swap very often or realistically both
NuheiTNzLd8,710160,711839,but then at that point if you're
NuheiTNzLd8,711839,714399,upgrading both you're not far away from
NuheiTNzLd8,714399,716800,a 14-inch macbook pro especially if you
NuheiTNzLd8,716800,718800,get one at a discount which you can get
NuheiTNzLd8,718800,720720,on amazon we'll link it down below
NuheiTNzLd8,720720,722480,that's a much better machine so i think
NuheiTNzLd8,722480,723839,that's the video we're going to do next
NuheiTNzLd8,723839,725200,we're going to compare the 14 inch real
NuheiTNzLd8,725200,727600,world performance compared to
NuheiTNzLd8,727600,730800,the 13 inch macbook pro so if you guys
NuheiTNzLd8,730800,732079,want to see that make sure you click
NuheiTNzLd8,732079,734079,that circle above check out one of those
NuheiTNzLd8,734079,735519,great videos over there this max and
NuheiTNzLd8,735519,738560,i'll see you in the next video
