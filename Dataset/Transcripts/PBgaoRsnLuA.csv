PBgaoRsnLuA,142720,144319,great because it was all of us having to
PBgaoRsnLuA,144319,146560,do it together versus
PBgaoRsnLuA,146560,148720,rose thinking that it's just her

PBgaoRsnLuA,409120,410479,thank you so much for the time thanks a
PBgaoRsnLuA,410479,413039,lot thank you
PBgaoRsnLuA,414319,416319,when i i watched some of the greatest
PBgaoRsnLuA,416319,418000,you know other than like khabib like
PBgaoRsnLuA,418000,419840,when i started talking about legacy like
PBgaoRsnLuA,419840,421280,that i just feel like it yeah that's
PBgaoRsnLuA,421280,423039,when they start losing it you know what
PBgaoRsnLuA,423039,423840,i mean
PBgaoRsnLuA,423840,425280,and it's like i'm not talking about it
PBgaoRsnLuA,425280,427919,but they keep asking me about it
PBgaoRsnLuA,427919,430319,you know it's not just like you know
PBgaoRsnLuA,430319,434319,like wins wins wins it's like what is it
PBgaoRsnLuA,434800,436319,more than that i don't know what that is
PBgaoRsnLuA,436319,438639,right now
PBgaoRsnLuA,440160,441919,have you thought about like what comes
PBgaoRsnLuA,441919,443280,next and when you're beating all the big
PBgaoRsnLuA,443280,445199,stars are you looking at other names or
PBgaoRsnLuA,445199,446800,is this more about something you want to
PBgaoRsnLuA,446800,448720,do a totality of your own you know
PBgaoRsnLuA,448720,451440,legacy what is it i'm clearly the best
PBgaoRsnLuA,451440,454400,obviously um it's just a question of
PBgaoRsnLuA,454400,457360,whether i'm the greatest in the division
PBgaoRsnLuA,457360,459840,i think this is a huge uh step towards
PBgaoRsnLuA,459840,461840,that for me i guess what i'm looking to
PBgaoRsnLuA,461840,464080,do is to try to set myself apart but i
PBgaoRsnLuA,464080,466080,think in the last fight maybe it was
PBgaoRsnLuA,466080,467599,kind of close and i've really been
PBgaoRsnLuA,467599,469199,working my butt off to just make sure
PBgaoRsnLuA,469199,470479,that i can
PBgaoRsnLuA,470479,472400,you know set that set that distance
PBgaoRsnLuA,472400,475199,between all of us
PBgaoRsnLuA,477440,478960,people look at him as the most violent
PBgaoRsnLuA,478960,480479,the most dangerous guy in the division
PBgaoRsnLuA,480479,483280,do you see him that way
PBgaoRsnLuA,485759,488759,foreign
PBgaoRsnLuA,503759,506160,such a unique type of champion right
PBgaoRsnLuA,506160,507360,because he doesn't have this aura of
PBgaoRsnLuA,507360,508800,invincibility we've seen him get really
PBgaoRsnLuA,508800,510479,badly hurt but it almost seems like he's
PBgaoRsnLuA,510479,512000,his most dangerous how can you
PBgaoRsnLuA,512000,514080,circumvent those type of challenge
PBgaoRsnLuA,514080,516880,his opponents really made some mistakes
PBgaoRsnLuA,516880,518159,chandler i think chandler whooped his
PBgaoRsnLuA,518159,520080,ass first round got too overconfident
PBgaoRsnLuA,520080,521599,and that's why the shot was so effective
PBgaoRsnLuA,521599,523760,he forgot how much danger he was in
PBgaoRsnLuA,523760,526160,however i create car crashes and i am
PBgaoRsnLuA,526160,528000,the object with the most force
PBgaoRsnLuA,528000,529040,so
PBgaoRsnLuA,529040,530399,if he wants to play that game i'm more
PBgaoRsnLuA,530399,533480,than happy
PBgaoRsnLuA,541680,543760,you

PBgaoRsnLuA,414319,416319,when i i watched some of the greatest
PBgaoRsnLuA,416319,418000,you know other than like khabib like
PBgaoRsnLuA,418000,419840,when i started talking about legacy like
PBgaoRsnLuA,419840,421280,that i just feel like it yeah that's
PBgaoRsnLuA,421280,423039,when they start losing it you know what
PBgaoRsnLuA,423039,423840,i mean
PBgaoRsnLuA,423840,425280,and it's like i'm not talking about it
PBgaoRsnLuA,425280,427919,but they keep asking me about it
PBgaoRsnLuA,427919,430319,you know it's not just like you know
PBgaoRsnLuA,430319,434319,like wins wins wins it's like what is it
PBgaoRsnLuA,434800,436319,more than that i don't know what that is
PBgaoRsnLuA,436319,438639,right now
PBgaoRsnLuA,440160,441919,have you thought about like what comes
PBgaoRsnLuA,441919,443280,next and when you're beating all the big
PBgaoRsnLuA,443280,445199,stars are you looking at other names or
PBgaoRsnLuA,445199,446800,is this more about something you want to
PBgaoRsnLuA,446800,448720,do a totality of your own you know
PBgaoRsnLuA,448720,451440,legacy what is it i'm clearly the best
PBgaoRsnLuA,451440,454400,obviously um it's just a question of
PBgaoRsnLuA,454400,457360,whether i'm the greatest in the division
PBgaoRsnLuA,457360,459840,i think this is a huge uh step towards
PBgaoRsnLuA,459840,461840,that for me i guess what i'm looking to
PBgaoRsnLuA,461840,464080,do is to try to set myself apart but i
PBgaoRsnLuA,464080,466080,think in the last fight maybe it was
PBgaoRsnLuA,466080,467599,kind of close and i've really been
PBgaoRsnLuA,467599,469199,working my butt off to just make sure
PBgaoRsnLuA,469199,470479,that i can
PBgaoRsnLuA,470479,472400,you know set that set that distance
PBgaoRsnLuA,472400,475199,between all of us
PBgaoRsnLuA,477440,478960,people look at him as the most violent
PBgaoRsnLuA,478960,480479,the most dangerous guy in the division
PBgaoRsnLuA,480479,483280,do you see him that way
PBgaoRsnLuA,485759,488759,foreign
PBgaoRsnLuA,503759,506160,such a unique type of champion right
PBgaoRsnLuA,506160,507360,because he doesn't have this aura of
PBgaoRsnLuA,507360,508800,invincibility we've seen him get really
PBgaoRsnLuA,508800,510479,badly hurt but it almost seems like he's
PBgaoRsnLuA,510479,512000,his most dangerous how can you
PBgaoRsnLuA,512000,514080,circumvent those type of challenge
PBgaoRsnLuA,514080,516880,his opponents really made some mistakes
PBgaoRsnLuA,516880,518159,chandler i think chandler whooped his
PBgaoRsnLuA,518159,520080,ass first round got too overconfident
PBgaoRsnLuA,520080,521599,and that's why the shot was so effective
PBgaoRsnLuA,521599,523760,he forgot how much danger he was in
PBgaoRsnLuA,523760,526160,however i create car crashes and i am
PBgaoRsnLuA,526160,528000,the object with the most force
PBgaoRsnLuA,528000,529040,so
PBgaoRsnLuA,529040,530399,if he wants to play that game i'm more
PBgaoRsnLuA,530399,533480,than happy
PBgaoRsnLuA,541680,543760,you
