1RgyYuK6zf8,680070,686000,[Applause]  here's what you should know about
1RgyYuK6zf8,686000,691440,winning before you chase it when he's  not loyal to you it doesn't care about  you winning doesn't care how sore you
1RgyYuK6zf8,691440,696959,are when he doesn't care how much sleep  you get when he doesn't care how hard  you work at times winning requires all
1RgyYuK6zf8,696959,703440,of you and then more and it promises you  nothing it's a mastermind of creating  fear and doubt your mind it causes
1RgyYuK6zf8,703440,709920,setback after setback so the question is  about winning are you willing to sprint  when the distance is unknown and why
1RgyYuK6zf8,709920,717320,chase this thing called winning because  the only thing that's guaranteed in life  if you don't chase it is losing

1RgyYuK6zf8,732000,737839,that i've been a lucky son of a [ __ ] to  achieve i operate every day as if i'm  starving
1RgyYuK6zf8,738320,744079,self-confidence is really  someone who keeps promises of themselves  because self-confidence is really like

1RgyYuK6zf8,750320,755710,other people think about it  [Music]
1RgyYuK6zf8,756720,762480,but more importantly  i want you to be  horrified
1RgyYuK6zf8,762480,768480,terrified  of sitting on the sidelines and doing
1RgyYuK6zf8,768480,776160,nothing  that is what i want you to be afraid of  waking up in six days or six weeks or
1RgyYuK6zf8,776160,782800,six years or 60 years and being no  closer to your goal
1RgyYuK6zf8,783920,789830,you've made no progress  that is the horror
1RgyYuK6zf8,789830,796399,[Music]  that is the nightmare  that is what you really need to be

1RgyYuK6zf8,880639,885920,attempt so you got to get comfortable  being uncomfortable if you ever want to
1RgyYuK6zf8,885920,889199,be successful
1RgyYuK6zf8,894160,900320,and what that shows is that if you  turn around and you confront the  suffering voluntarily you find out that
1RgyYuK6zf8,900320,906480,you are way tougher than you think it's  not that life is better than you think  life is as harsh as you think it might
1RgyYuK6zf8,906480,912560,even be worse  but you are way tougher than you think

1RgyYuK6zf8,1488559,1494080,pretending that that we don't have any  special goals or ambitions or desires
1RgyYuK6zf8,1494080,1499360,when really deep down inside we do  really want more because you have to  judge a tree by the fruit it bears not

1RgyYuK6zf8,1528240,1534240,others so you've got to completely  divorce yourself from this notion of  outcome and become completely obsessed
1RgyYuK6zf8,1534240,1539400,with the idea of sincere pursuit
1RgyYuK6zf8,1542800,1548960,[Music]  and so when you look at the night sky  and
1RgyYuK6zf8,1548960,1556799,that  sense of awe grips you and calls  something out of you right to respond to
1RgyYuK6zf8,1556799,1563120,your encounter with the infant even your  encounter with mortality your encounter  with finitude and limitation all of that
1RgyYuK6zf8,1563120,1569039,in relationship to the internet  that sense of awe is also the calling  forth of something out of you that can
1RgyYuK6zf8,1569039,1574960,respond to the challenge of that  infinite  well that's the microcosm within no it's
1RgyYuK6zf8,1574960,1582080,a reflection of the structure of the  cosmos itself  that's the divine ideal

1RgyYuK6zf8,1629919,1637200,of sincere pursuit  now why sincere pursuit  the reason to tie your
1RgyYuK6zf8,1637200,1643840,sense of self your self-esteem your  pride your ego your identity all of that  the reason to tie that to sincere

1RgyYuK6zf8,1741520,1747600,the journey starts with you finding why  the hell am i here on this planet earth  why am i here
1RgyYuK6zf8,1747600,1754639,if you don't know that you will live the  rest of your life searching  always asking the question why
1RgyYuK6zf8,1756320,1763440,i'm saying answer your call  the universe is calling you  hear something about life you can't get
1RgyYuK6zf8,1763440,1771039,out of it alive hello  you can't get out of life alive  live now like maria said

1RgyYuK6zf8,1793440,1799360,all the great ones in life  one thing they had was composure no  matter what people do with them
1RgyYuK6zf8,1799360,1805039,hate negativity gossip drama rumors no  matter what they do with them they stay
1RgyYuK6zf8,1805039,1809320,focused on where they were trying to go

1RgyYuK6zf8,1819200,1826320,so there's two things you can do with  change you can react to it or you can  participate in it it's going to change
1RgyYuK6zf8,1826320,1832960,anyway  so if you keep waiting around you're  going to have to react to the change and
1RgyYuK6zf8,1832960,1839360,now you're behind  but if you participate in the change if  you know the job you have is not gonna
1RgyYuK6zf8,1839360,1846880,last forever  when you go to work at every day that's  gonna change
1RgyYuK6zf8,1847679,1854320,so what you gotta start doing is you got  to start anticipating that it's going to  change  and just start living your life with the
1RgyYuK6zf8,1854320,1860159,preparation for change  at the beginning of the year
1RgyYuK6zf8,1860159,1867120,a lot of you had goals  a lot of drive a lot of motivation
1RgyYuK6zf8,1867120,1873360,was easter  it's the middle of april  to make sure i get too far worth my
1RgyYuK6zf8,1873360,1879840,goals my dreams  a lot of you are proud of who you are  you're like the person you created do
1RgyYuK6zf8,1879840,1886000,nothing  start from scratch  create somebody that you're proud of
1RgyYuK6zf8,1886000,1891039,stay hard  you can learn all the techniques in the
1RgyYuK6zf8,1891039,1898080,world if you don't believe in yourself  it won't happen for you
1RgyYuK6zf8,1898080,1903440,i learned all of it  [Music]  focus on the seller you've got to focus
1RgyYuK6zf8,1903440,1910480,on you  and as you convince you  as you sell yourself every day every day
1RgyYuK6zf8,1910480,1916320,every day you will begin to see a  difference in the things that you're  doing  selling yourself on your ability to
1RgyYuK6zf8,1916320,1922960,perform a job to achieve a certain  objective telling yourself every day  here i go again
1RgyYuK6zf8,1922960,1930720,and i got what it takes  this is my day and nothing out here is  going to stop me
1RgyYuK6zf8,1930720,1937120,so why was greater than defeat his why  was greater than his trial and his  tribulation and i'm telling you if you
1RgyYuK6zf8,1937120,1944320,don't know what your why is and your why  isn't strong you're gonna get knocked  out every single day
1RgyYuK6zf8,1944640,1951480,and say in spite of this  i'm in control here
1RgyYuK6zf8,1964880,1971679,motivation has nothing to do with it see  most people are waiting for motivation  when motivation is just a spark to get
1RgyYuK6zf8,1971679,1977679,things moving but it's your commitment  that gets you to the gym every single  time you don't go because you're
1RgyYuK6zf8,1977679,1983279,motivated you see you don't do the  things you know you need to do to reach  your goals because you're motivated to
1RgyYuK6zf8,1983279,1989840,do those things you do it because you  you got the mindset of a machine you  just say every tuesday thursday this is
1RgyYuK6zf8,1989840,1995200,what i do every tuesday thursday that's  what i do every tuesday thursday that's  what i do  you just can do it because that's what
1RgyYuK6zf8,1995200,2002480,you set out to do  success and failure are not giant events
1RgyYuK6zf8,2002480,2007519,they don't just show up you don't just  suddenly become successful or suddenly  have this cataclysmic event that makes
1RgyYuK6zf8,2007519,2012559,you fail and they look that way  but failure comes from all the little  things
1RgyYuK6zf8,2012559,2019919,it's failure to make the call  it's failure to check the books  it's failure to say i'm sorry
1RgyYuK6zf8,2019919,2025840,it's failure to push yourself to do  things physically that you don't want to  do  and all those little failures day after
1RgyYuK6zf8,2025840,2031200,day come together until one day some  cataclysmic event happens you blame that  that event happened because you missed
1RgyYuK6zf8,2031200,2038480,all the little stuff  i'm not gonna let this get me down i'm  not gonna let this destroy me
1RgyYuK6zf8,2038480,2046080,i'm coming back  and i'll be stronger and better because  of it you have got to make a declaration
1RgyYuK6zf8,2046080,2051440,that this is what you stand for  you're standing up for your dreams  you're standing up for peace of mind
1RgyYuK6zf8,2051440,2056560,you're standing up for health  you want it
1RgyYuK6zf8,2056560,2063919,and you're going to go all out to have  it  it's not going to be easy when you want  to change it's not easy if we're in fact

1RgyYuK6zf8,2274460,2279680,[Music]  to turn into today's stress
1RgyYuK6zf8,2280000,2288640,too many of us are good too good  at carrying the things from our past
1RgyYuK6zf8,2288640,2295920,into our present  [Music]
1RgyYuK6zf8,2295920,2302800,and we live our whole entire life  and stress our whole entire life in  worry
1RgyYuK6zf8,2302800,2308960,and we don't use our one superpower that  we have  [Music]  which is appreciation
1RgyYuK6zf8,2308960,2317280,when you get in your own way that's what  self-doubt is  the the fastest band-aid ripped off
1RgyYuK6zf8,2317280,2327119,remedy to fixing this  terrible situation is to do  the thing you're afraid to do do it it's
1RgyYuK6zf8,2327119,2333839,not about feeling confident about going  into the situation it's not about  knowing that it's going to work out it's
1RgyYuK6zf8,2333839,2340079,not about having the most detailed  plan  for how this thing will happen it's
1RgyYuK6zf8,2340079,2347119,about doing it  courage you get encourages what you will
1RgyYuK6zf8,2347119,2352720,experience and what you will grow  when the doubt is there but you do it
1RgyYuK6zf8,2352720,2358560,anyway so your problem isn't doubt your  problem is courage doubt is going to be
1RgyYuK6zf8,2358560,2366838,there  but doubt gets out of the way  when you express courage
1RgyYuK6zf8,2368480,2374079,if you can't be a pine on the top of the  hill be a scrub in the valley but be the
1RgyYuK6zf8,2374079,2379680,best little scrub on the side of the  reel be a bush if you can't be a tree if
1RgyYuK6zf8,2379680,2386320,you can't be a highway just be a trail  if you can't be the sun be a star for it
1RgyYuK6zf8,2386320,2392810,isn't my size that you win or you fail  be the best of whatever you are
1RgyYuK6zf8,2392810,2399200,[Music]  also to remind you like everything  you're going through is preparing you i
1RgyYuK6zf8,2399200,2404400,want to remind you of that like  everything that you're going through is  preparing you for something greater
1RgyYuK6zf8,2404400,2409680,right everything  that you went through  you made it through because you're here
1RgyYuK6zf8,2409680,2415680,you made it through and the things that  you made it through is preparing you for  what's meant for you
1RgyYuK6zf8,2415680,2420880,everything that you went through  it made it through  i'm sure you can think right now all the
1RgyYuK6zf8,2420880,2426400,times you feel like me and my life is  over my story is done but you made it  through it
1RgyYuK6zf8,2426400,2432480,everything that you went through and  made it through is preparing you was  preparing you  for what
1RgyYuK6zf8,2432480,2437680,it's meant for you  what's your why
1RgyYuK6zf8,2437680,2443839,you need a why why do you need a why  because some days you're gonna look at  that alarm clock you're gonna look at  that alarm clock and it's gonna say six
1RgyYuK6zf8,2443839,2450960,and six is the time you wake up and  you're gonna look again it's gonna say  605 and you're going to say i don't want  to get up but that y is going to say i
1RgyYuK6zf8,2450960,2456800,push yourself get up  your mama needs you your daddy needs you
1RgyYuK6zf8,2456800,2461920,your children need you you don't commit  get up  [Music]
1RgyYuK6zf8,2461920,2467760,your why's gonna push you when you can't  push yourself when you want to quit and  give up your why is going to give you
1RgyYuK6zf8,2467760,2474160,that edge you need that advantage you  need that that lift that you need to get  to the next level you're why
1RgyYuK6zf8,2474160,2480560,do the thing and you will have the power  we're waiting waiting waiting waiting  for the power we're waiting not to
1RgyYuK6zf8,2480560,2486000,self-doubt any longer right whatever it  is that you're deciding that you want to  do with yourself that you're doubting
1RgyYuK6zf8,2486000,2491000,your ability on  just do it
1RgyYuK6zf8,2496560,2501599,great ideas are never going to interrupt  you they have to be pursued and you if
1RgyYuK6zf8,2501599,2506880,you don't pursue them you're going to  get what everybody else has which is all  this fear all this uncertainty all this
1RgyYuK6zf8,2506880,2513280,stuff won't work because everybody's  focused on what won't work what can't  happen why because they're afraid  they're afraid to fail they're afraid to
1RgyYuK6zf8,2513280,2519359,try and feel like they're not enough so  you've got to stay in guard of that mind  by feeding your mind you know jim rohn
1RgyYuK6zf8,2519359,2524640,used to say to me success leaves clues  if you want thing to get better you got  to get better if you want things to
1RgyYuK6zf8,2524640,2530190,change you got to change but you got to  do it deliberately and consciously
1RgyYuK6zf8,2530190,2537440,[Music]  and so what happens is we very often  reinforce things when we put things in
1RgyYuK6zf8,2537440,2542800,the negative  right i can't get apart  i can't get apart
1RgyYuK6zf8,2542800,2551079,i can't get apart or  i can't do this versus i'm going to keep  doing this
1RgyYuK6zf8,2551280,2557280,it's the same thing for you if you focus  on the obstacles all you will see is  obstacles it's your choice how you
1RgyYuK6zf8,2557280,2563480,choose to perceive your own career it's  literally perspective
1RgyYuK6zf8,2567839,2574560,if you watch a great movie if you read a  great book you know the size and the  power of the hero how much you become as
1RgyYuK6zf8,2574560,2581440,a hero is defined by how tough an  obstacle you face how difficult is the  villain the opponent
1RgyYuK6zf8,2582400,2587440,the things you know you're supposed to  do
1RgyYuK6zf8,2587760,2594400,do them  and be as strong as you can mentally
1RgyYuK6zf8,2594400,2601280,physically and emotionally for yourself  for your team
1RgyYuK6zf8,2601280,2607280,for your family  hold the line
1RgyYuK6zf8,2607280,2612560,and be strong  listen to me many of you right now
1RgyYuK6zf8,2612560,2618160,life's got you up against the rope and  you got to do me a favor like you can't  give up you can't give in life listen to
1RgyYuK6zf8,2618160,2624400,me if it was easy everybody would do it  and if life's got you backed up i need  you to do what buster douglas did buster
1RgyYuK6zf8,2624400,2632800,douglas start fighting back  he said i know you knocked out 30 other  people before me but i won't be the 31st
1RgyYuK6zf8,2632800,2638720,you gotta tell life i don't know who  you've been dealing with but you ain't  dealt with me  you gotta tell bankruptcy you gotta tell
1RgyYuK6zf8,2638720,2643760,divorce you gotta tell sickness i don't  know i don't know who you've been  dealing with
1RgyYuK6zf8,2643760,2648359,but you come up against the wrong one  this time
1RgyYuK6zf8,2651760,2658000,uh courage is the most important  important of all the virtues
1RgyYuK6zf8,2658000,2664400,because without courage you can't  practice any other virtue consistently
1RgyYuK6zf8,2665200,2670160,you see you can't be consistently kind
1RgyYuK6zf8,2671440,2677838,or fair  or humane  or generous
1RgyYuK6zf8,2679040,2686480,not without courage because  if you don't have it sooner or later  you'll stop and say
1RgyYuK6zf8,2688000,2696480,the threat is too much the the  difficulties to to hide  the challenges is too great
1RgyYuK6zf8,2696640,2704400,there was someone before me  someone found the path  someone made the road before me
1RgyYuK6zf8,2704400,2710680,and i have the responsibility of making  the road for someone who is yet to come
1RgyYuK6zf8,2710680,2716720,[Music]  so tonight the question i ask you is  what things in your life are you going
1RgyYuK6zf8,2716720,2723040,to give a funeral to  what things in your life have to die  what things in your life have been
1RgyYuK6zf8,2723040,2728800,keeping you from seeing the greatest  version of yourself have been keeping  you from knowing your worth have been  keeping you from seeing how special you
1RgyYuK6zf8,2728800,2734480,are  have been keeping you to live in  depression have been keeping you to live
1RgyYuK6zf8,2734480,2740560,in pain what things are you allowing to  live in your life that need to be dead
1RgyYuK6zf8,2741520,2747200,because the truth of the matter is  and i'm not trying to put fear in your  heart but i'm putting reality on your
1RgyYuK6zf8,2747200,2754560,mind  the truth of the matter is we're all  going to die  [Music]
1RgyYuK6zf8,2754560,2760320,but the truth of that is  not all of us are going to live
1RgyYuK6zf8,2760320,2765920,[Music]  it might be april where you are
1RgyYuK6zf8,2765920,2772160,and you were expecting nice brothers  plus 20 degrees  so
1RgyYuK6zf8,2772160,2778560,you might be somewhere where it's too  hot  so  you have sore legs
1RgyYuK6zf8,2778560,2784960,sore backs or shoulder  so  the struggle is real
1RgyYuK6zf8,2784960,2791680,it never gets any easier  you got to get harder  no one cares what you did yesterday
1RgyYuK6zf8,2791680,2797280,the only match is doing today  i'm a cheerleader  for those who want to be better not for
1RgyYuK6zf8,2797280,2801319,those who want to stay the same
1RgyYuK6zf8,2803280,2809040,but we're so stuck in this comfort zone  and the comfort zone is a beautiful  place but nothing ever grows there we're
1RgyYuK6zf8,2809040,2814640,so stuck where it's convenient we're so  stuck in this ritual where it feels good  and so when god tries to shake us up a
1RgyYuK6zf8,2814640,2820720,little bit the problem always happens  before the miracle  [Music]
1RgyYuK6zf8,2820720,2825039,the lessons always come before the  blessings
1RgyYuK6zf8,2826319,2833119,how bad do you want your goal right now  i think there's a lot of people in the  world today because it's a really niche  thing to talk about i want this this is
1RgyYuK6zf8,2833119,2838319,my outcome this is my goal like how bad  do you want do you want as bad as  breathing do you want it as bad as
1RgyYuK6zf8,2838319,2847359,anything you've ever wanted in your life  and if you calibrate it at the highest  enough levels what i found is the people  that are the hungriest they find a way
1RgyYuK6zf8,2847359,2852640,you choose to stay comfortable you  choose comfort you choose to stay  comfortable
1RgyYuK6zf8,2852640,2858559,you choose to stay in a place that you  know your life shouldn't be anymore
1RgyYuK6zf8,2858559,2864880,some of us we've been living in the same  place for the last decade for the last  15 years for the last five years
1RgyYuK6zf8,2864880,2871040,and we've been keeping ourselves in a  place that has done no good for our life  some of us need to give that funeral to
1RgyYuK6zf8,2871040,2877839,the environments in our life  as you know what you surround your life  around is what you'll become
1RgyYuK6zf8,2877839,2883440,and when you go through something you  won't learn some lessons but it's not  always easy to extract lessons from a
1RgyYuK6zf8,2883440,2886680,bad situation
1RgyYuK6zf8,2892480,2899680,to me every day is a beginning a new day  a new week a new shot at life
1RgyYuK6zf8,2899680,2905359,an opportunity to come out of the gate  like a man possessed and attack the day
1RgyYuK6zf8,2905359,2912400,without mercy  today  i'm taking scalps
1RgyYuK6zf8,2912400,2918079,i'm putting the pressure on i'm the  aggressor i'm on the attack
1RgyYuK6zf8,2918079,2924960,and of course  i will get tired  i will get beat up i'll get knocked down
1RgyYuK6zf8,2924960,2930480,and drained and i will have some bad  days  but i
1RgyYuK6zf8,2930480,2935119,will not  stop
1RgyYuK6zf8,2936160,2943200,when you know why you want something  when it's desperation the power of being  desperate is something that most people
1RgyYuK6zf8,2943200,2948400,avoid they think desperation is a  weakness and i'm here to tell you  desperation is one of the most powerful
1RgyYuK6zf8,2948400,2956240,emotions you could possibly possess  because when you're desperate you find  reserves and reservoirs of ideas talents
1RgyYuK6zf8,2956240,2962880,and a straight that you don't know you  have when you find yourself in a  desperate situation
1RgyYuK6zf8,2964920,2970559,[Music]  so the number one thing we need more  than anything to win is hunger which
1RgyYuK6zf8,2970559,2976880,comes from a state of desperation yet  we're constantly trying to comfort  ourselves in the real world to avoid the
1RgyYuK6zf8,2976880,2982480,state of being desperate  and so i love the process i love it i
1RgyYuK6zf8,2982480,2988400,love working for what i want i love the  sacrifice i love the dedication i love  the commitment i love that everybody
1RgyYuK6zf8,2988400,2993760,wants the prize nobody wants to process  everybody wants to be a diamond nobody  is willing to get cut everybody wants to
1RgyYuK6zf8,2993760,2999440,go to heaven nobody wants to  die i'm saying to you whatever you got
1RgyYuK6zf8,2999440,3006300,to do do it because if you don't life is  going to whoop you until you surrender
1RgyYuK6zf8,3006300,3012440,[Music]  so if it's hard then do it hard
1RgyYuK6zf8,3013839,3018880,these are not tears of sorrow these are  tears of joy because the thing i  understand the only thing i need you to
1RgyYuK6zf8,3018880,3026960,do is deal with it in the right way and  watch what god not only does in your  life watch what god does in everybody's  life that's connected to you
1RgyYuK6zf8,3026960,3032079,[Music]  and the thing about every storm every
1RgyYuK6zf8,3032079,3036280,storm has an expiration date
1RgyYuK6zf8,3045839,3051200,so when i don't see the point and i feel  like my life is being dismantled could
1RgyYuK6zf8,3051200,3056240,it be  that god's preparation  comes packaged
1RgyYuK6zf8,3056240,3063680,as pain  and maybe if you could see it that way
1RgyYuK6zf8,3063680,3068800,it wouldn't take the pain away  but it would give the pain a purpose
1RgyYuK6zf8,3068800,3075839,if you could see  what you've been calling a failure  really wasn't a failure
1RgyYuK6zf8,3075839,3082720,it was a foundation  you're 25 you could be an idiot it's no
1RgyYuK6zf8,3082720,3088319,problem  okay well now you're the same person at  30.
1RgyYuK6zf8,3088319,3094559,it's like people aren't so thrilled  about you at that point it's like what  the hell have you been doing for the  last 10 years well i'm just as clueless
1RgyYuK6zf8,3094559,3100960,as i was when i was 22. yeah but you're  not 22.  you're an old infant
1RgyYuK6zf8,3100960,3107359,right and that's an ugly thing an old  infant  so  the reason part of the reason you choose
1RgyYuK6zf8,3107359,3112640,your damn sacrifice  because the sacrifice is inevitable
1RgyYuK6zf8,3112640,3119599,but at least you get to choose it  part of the proper path of development
1RgyYuK6zf8,3119599,3125440,in the last half of life was to  rediscover  the child that you left behind as you
1RgyYuK6zf8,3125440,3132750,were apprenticing  and so then you get to be something and  regain that potential at the same time
1RgyYuK6zf8,3132750,3138960,[Music]  make a decision
1RgyYuK6zf8,3138960,3145119,because if you don't decide  well you know
1RgyYuK6zf8,3146480,3153839,life decides for you  indecision
1RgyYuK6zf8,3155119,3158599,is still a decision
1RgyYuK6zf8,3166640,3168720,you
